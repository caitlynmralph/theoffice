Michael| After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight.
Michael| Erin... what are you doing?
Erin| Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybodys dying to see it.
Michael| Thats... Thats. Well, dont put words in my mouth.
Jim| Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Pam| Were all in it, from like years and years ago. Its like a home movie. 
Jim| Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Pam| Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didnt go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Pam| Wed love to see it!
Michael| Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
Pam| Okay everyone, I know were really excited to see this movie that everybodys in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so lets stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and well have a pure fun day! Okay?
Creed| Thanks mom.
Holly| You never told me you made a movie.
Michael| Mhmm! Its got action, its got heart, its got some bosom.
Holly| Its got you.
Michael| Its got a lot of me.
Holly|  I cant wait.
Michael| Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level Midnight. 
Dwight|Michael
 Dwight does not play a robot.|Daryl
 I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought itd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.|Jim
 I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.|Dwight
 He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?|Jan
 He finished his movie?  No kidding. Wow, thats great. Yeah thats good for him.|Michael
 By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.|Michael
 That was not scripted.|Karen
 Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?|Jim
  Sorry.|Michael
 |Jim
 Im sorry, Im really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.|Kelly
 Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!|Kevin
 Its like one of the best movies Ive ever seen in my life.|Ryan
 You should enter it in festivals!|Kevin
 Or carnivals!|Michael
  Well thats a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?|Holly
 Uh... which part?|Michael
 Okay.  No, its not good enough. Its not good enough...|Andy
 Some people are really popping on screen!|Michael
 Hey.|Holly
 Hey! Good movie.|Michael
 Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says its great!|Holly
 I loved it.|Michael
 Did you? What did you love about it?|Holly
 Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isnt that great when you can all work together like that?|Michael
 No, no. Holly, this isnt Oceans Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and dont care about how it turns out. Whatd you really think, honestly.|Holly
 Uhm...|Michael
 Is it, is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.|Holly
 Not worried about that.|Michael
  It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you dont think its great than youre basically saying that you dont believe in my dream.|Holly
 Wha- Its your dream and you never even mentioned it before!|Michael
 I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I couldve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.|Holly
 Well why do you have to make a movie at all?|Michael
 Because, if I dont have this, what do I have? I have nothing.|Holly
 Really, you cant think of anything else that you might have?|Michael
 I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.|Holly
 Im real.|Michael
 Yeah, youre a real pain in the ass. And Im gonna go watch the movie with people who think its great! And Im sorry I called you a pain in the ass, Im angry, and I love you.|Holly
 I love you too.|Michael
 I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although Ive only seen Antz, but Ill tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bugs Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bugs Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, dont listen to your critics, listen to your fans.|Michael
 Who likes Threat Level Midnight?  Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! |Michael
 We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.|Jim
  Thats fine, its great!|Michael
 No, no! Actually its really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. Thats why there were so many people there. |Michael
 Hey...|Holly
 Hey, Im sorry. It is good.|Michael
 No its not.  Its not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.|Michael
 |Michael 
Billy Hey! We got sports games again! |Michael
 Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.|Andy
  Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isnt the president evil?|Michael
 Oh yeah!  Yes he is!      |Dwight
 No no, hes doing it to catch the president!|Michael
 No, no Dwight. Hes just being stupid. |
