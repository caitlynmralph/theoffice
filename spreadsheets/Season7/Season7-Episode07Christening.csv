Pam| I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. Its that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, theyve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Kelly| I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Michael| Thats true, thats true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
Jim| Stop.
Michael|  Um... kay. Uh, alright.
Pam| One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Erin| Di-Did you say vampire?
Pam| Oh, no, its just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. 
Dwight| Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania?  Cause of the euro.
Pam| Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Dont come in if youre sick.
Dwight|  Uh... 
Pam| And get your flu shot. Also, Im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Dwight| NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Jim| Elaborate.
Dwight| The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... 
Pam| Im not - Im not going to do that. Im not going to do that.
Dwight| Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Jim| So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Dwight| Yes. I would welcome it.
Jim|  Youre welcome.
Dwight| The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I dont know why everyone doesnt do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
Angela| Jim. Pam.  And the precious bundle of Gods gift to everything.  I wish you both a pleasant day.  And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
Pam| Ceces getting christened today.
Jim| Big day.
Pam| Everyone from work is here. We werent planning on that.
Jim| Nope. 
Michael| Top of the Sunday morning to you.
Andy| And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Ryan| Hope you brought your pipes. Were about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Michael| Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.
Michael| I invited everyone in the office because its not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
Andy|  Ah, man. 
Andy| Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put em in a box, give em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
Dwight|  For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
Toby| Sunday church service... its been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
Michael|  Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you cant refuse. Scooch over.
Pam| Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
Michael| But Im the Godfather.
Jim| It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Michael| Are you talking to me?
Jim|  Ok, your turn.
Michael| Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Pam| Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, Im so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know youre not Ceces godfather.
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| Im sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. Im so sorry.
Michael|  Im not the godfather.
Pam| Okay, thank you.
Michael|  So who is the godfather?
Pam| Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
Michael| Okay. Old friend, like, youve known him since kindergarten?
Pam| No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. Theyre a great couple. You should meet them later.
Michael| No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Pam| Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
Michael| I dont even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And thats not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
Church congregation|  We ask you, Lord, come to our aid.
Pastor| Good morning.
All| Good morning.
Michael| Good morning.
Pastor| What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing. 
 Pastor| You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. Theyre leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.
Ryan| Ive heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
Toby|  Okay, this is, all right, this is silly.   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope... 
Female church member| And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
Pastor| Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? 
Dwight| Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Pastor| Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. Weve come to celebrate these babies.
Pam|  Somebody needs a change.
Jim| Right now?
Pam| Well, she cant bring this up with her.
Jim| Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? Were gonna take a little field trip.
Jim|  Okay. Okay. Theres my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. Whats that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
Pam|  What?
Jim| What?
Pam| Honey, no.
Jim| Yes.
Pam| No, no.
Jim| This is happening.
Pam| We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Jim| No. Theres no extra outfit in the bag.
Pam| You said you checked it.
Jim| I did... say that.
Pastor| At this time, will the families please come join me?
Michael| Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. Its as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. Thats great, because, you know, the paper industrys not gonna last forever.
Pastor| Before we go, Id like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
Jim| Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Jim| Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The Halberts are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."
Ryan| For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Kelly| Try "Jesus."
Dwight| Opus dei.
Male church member|  Hi. Good morning.
Michael| Good morning.
Female church member | Good morning.
Michael| Good morning.
Ryan| Hello.
Dwight| Shh, shh, shh.
Michael|  How are you? Good morning. Good morning. 
Lady| Good morning.
Michael| I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
Jim| Hey.
Doug | Im Doug Mcpherson, Daveys uncle.
Jim| Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
Doug| Davey.
Jim| Yeah. 
Pam| Wow.
Angela| Well, this is intimate.
Pam| We just had to add a few more tables. We werent expecting this many people.
Angela| You dont know them all?
Pam| Nope, and were gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed em all.
Angela| Jesus is not your caterer.  But he should be your caterer cause youre a little angel. Why didnt your parents get you a caterer?  They dont think.
Pam|  Hm. Dont listen to her. Shes just jealous cause she doesnt get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Jim| Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Pam| I dont know. Im just hungry.
Jim| Okay, well, you know what? Everybodys hungry.  Sorry. I think Im just hungry.
Michael| Oh, after you.
Male church member| Oh, no, after you.
Michael| No, I insist. After me.
Male church member|  Im gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.
Michael| Thank you. You too.
Stanley| This is not the meal I was promised. Im going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Kevin| I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Michael| You know what, guys, lets just enjoy lunch.
Kevin| With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
Girl| Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry thats leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there. 
Ryan|  Teach for America girls are way hotter, but theyre nuts.
Girl| This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
Phyllis|  Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Stanley| I would run to Mexico if thats where the sandwiches are.
Michael| Shh.
Girl| Right now, Jessicas children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.
Michael| No.
Girl| Its gonna be three months of hard work and when were done, well practically be Quimixtanos.
Dwight| Greg, hello, its Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Michael|  Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
Dwight| I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Michael| Are you kidding me? Stop it.
Dwight| Ill call you back.
Girl| My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldnt hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?
Andy| What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Michael| Shh.
Girl| Thank you. Or should I say gracias?
Pam|  Cece went down.
Woman|  What was this? Youre out of it.
Jim| Scones.
Woman| I didnt get one.
Pam| Well, if it makes you feel better, I didnt get one either.
Woman| Is it just the one jug of apple cider? 
Pam| Who the heck was that?
Jim| I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
Pam| We need more food. Ill go get some subs and sodas.
Jim| All right. And cider.
Michael|  Look at that. Look at that. Thats fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Lets go help Africa. Lets go build an airport. Well start small. Well have a car wash. Well send some cheerleaders to regionals.
Stanley| You could feed the hungry. Us.
Oscar| Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Michael| Yeah, well, thats just a pick-up scene. Okay, we dont have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
Darryl| We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Michael| Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Phyllis| Church isnt a party, Michael.
Michael| Well, its, its-
Ryan| Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Michael| No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? Whats so great about your lives that you think youre better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? Youre mean. Youre mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you dont stop worrying so much about what youre gonna put in your gullet, youre gonna die in about a month.
Jim| Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Dont worry. Shes asleep. Im just gonna track down some more chairs.
Mee-Maw| Fine, fine. I guess Ill watch Suzannes purse and your baby.
Michael|  Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. Were proud of you.  Bye. Okay.
Michael|  Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Students| Yeah! 
Michael|  Ill take a shirt.
Guy| Are you coming?
Michael| If youll have me, yes.
Guy| Heck, yes.
Michael| Really?  Thank you. All right.
Oscar|  Michael. Get off the bus.
Michael| No, Im not. Im staying on the bus. Im already on the bus. Im going.
Gabe| Michael, this is irresponsible.
Michael| It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
Darryl| I agree. I think its superb.
Gabe| Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Michael| You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
Andy| Michael, you cant go to Mexico. You dont have your passport. 
Guy|  You dont need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.
Michael| Hey, right?
Phyllis| Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Michael| Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
Phyllis| Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Michael| Tell them that Im in a meeting.
Dwight| Michael, Im just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Michael| No, you may not.
Dwight| Gah!
Erin| I think its really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Michael| Thank you.
Andy|  Save me an aisle seat, Michael! Im coming!
Andy| I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick. 
Guy| Were actually building them a school.
Andy| Whatever. I wont-I wont stand for it.
Michael|  See you in a few months.
Girl| If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldnt have so many problems.
Michael| Mm. Thats not gonna happen.
Andy| Were one in a million.
Girl| I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
Michael| Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So... 
Andy| Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals... 
Toby|  Why you always got to be so mean to me?
Jim|  Uh, MeeMaw, wheres Cece?
MeeMaw| I dont know. I lost the purse too.
Jim| Okay.
Andy| Good-bye, Lackawana County.
Michael| How long till we get to Mexico?
Andy| Well, two days minus how long weve been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
Michael| Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
Andy| I dont know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or... 
Michael| Why arent they building it themselves?
Andy| They dont know how.
Michael| Do we know how? I dont know how. You know how?
Andy| Well, Carla knows.
Michael| Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Carla| Oh, trying to sleep.
Michael| What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Andy| Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Michael| Oh, God, you know what? Im gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
Andy| And the Christmas party.
Michael| And Cinco de Mayo.
Andy| Nah, no. Well be back before that.
Michael| No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums havent even started. Now were those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
Jim| Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
Phyllis| Heres her carrier, but no Cece.
Jims Dad| Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Wheres the little girl of honor?
Jim| I dont know, dad. I dont know.
Doug| I dont mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there.
Jim| I dont know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Doug| I think maybe some blonde lady had her.
Jim| A small blonde woman?
Doug| Smaller than me.
Jim| Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
Angela|  What are you doing?
Kevin|  Give me the baby!
Angela| What? Kevin!
Helene|  Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
Jim|  Hi.
Pam|  Honey.
Jim|  Hi.  All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Angela| Did you think I stole your baby?
Jim| Whats that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, dont, because Ive got my eye on you.
Kevin|  Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Angela| Someone put them in my bag.
Doug|  So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, lets haul out. Rendezvous at Friendlys.
Pam| Did you lose Cece?
Jim| Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
Michael| Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
Andy| I can make myself cry.
Michael| Do that. Do it.
Andy| Should I-I got it. I got it.  Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Bus driver| Cant stop. Were on a schedule.
Andy| Well, uh, theres a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Bus driver| Maybe well stop in Tennesseee. Its not safe to talk to a driver.
Michael|  Okay, driver, driver, if youre not gonna stop this bus, then Im going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. 
Bus driver| Stopping in Tennessee.
Guy| Hey, is there a problem, you guys?
Michael| Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Guy| Why?
Andy| Just make him stop the freaking bus!
Michael| Stop the bus, okay?
Carla| Are you okay, sir?
Michael| I didnt sign up for this. You guys are young, thats great. You want to give back to society. Ive done that. I need to take.
Girl| You have plenty left to give. Youre doing-
Michael| Blah-di-blah!
Andy| It doesnt matter.
Michael| We could go back and forth all day. Its not gonna solve anything.
Andy| If we went to Mexico, wed probably screw everything up anyway.
Michael| Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you dont. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
Andy| Stop the bus!
Michael and Andy|  Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Guy| Okay, stop the dang bus.
Michael|  Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. Well keep an eye on America for you.
Another guy|  Wait for me!  Dont say anything to my parents.
Erin|  Get in quick.
Michael| Why quick?
Erin| So its faster.
Erin| Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Michael| Is anyone still at the church?
Erin| No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Michael| What? Shut up.
Erin| Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Merediths minivan.
Michael| It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Erin| I bet. You guys.
Guy| Can I come? 
Erin| Oh, Lake Wobblegones on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Radio| "... banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. Itd been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots."
