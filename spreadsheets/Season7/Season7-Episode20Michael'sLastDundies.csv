Michael| It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
DeAngelo| Yes, and this happens every...?
Michael| Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. 
DeAngelo| Well, you know, why dont we try it, and if it goes good itll be part of my tradition.
Michael| Why do you always say that? Youre gonna love it.
Michael|  Alright lets go!  This way, this way! 
DeAngelo| Thanks.
Michael| Surprise!
DeAngelo| Congratulations!
Jim| Yep, okay...
Michael| You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Jim| Okay.
Michael|  Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Jim| No she doesnt wa- Shes not here.
Pam| Whats going on?
Jim| Stay in bed!
Michael|  Congratulations!
Stanley| Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Michael| We got it.
DeAngelo| Uh, leave it at the door or...?
Michael| Yeah thats fine.
Michael|  Hey Toby! You suck! 
DeAngelo| Is this an employee of ours?
Michael|  Go go go go go go!
Michael|  Ive never seen this place in the daylight. 
DeAngelo| It reminds me of Katrina.
Michael| Here we go, alright got it? Set?  Hello? 
Meredith| Im so busted! Walk of shame!
DeAngelo| Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Meredith| Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Michael| Yes you did. Thats right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Meredith| No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins.  Let me fix you breakfast!
DeAngelo|  Im not going in there.
Michael|  Go.
Michael|  Good morning Erin.
Erin| Oh hey, didnt see you.
Michael| You have big plans for tonight?
Erin| I dont know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I dont know. Maybe Im going to the Dundies!! 
Michael| You are getting so funny!  Very good.
Michael| The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didnt just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Michael| Anything can happen at the Dundies!  Theyre like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Dwight| Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Michael| Black tie optional.
Dwight| Every day is black tie optional!
Michael| A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Kevin| Nice! 
Phyllis| I love their breadsticks!
Pam| Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
Ryan| I love when people say like crack when theyve obviously never done crack.
Pam| Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
Ryan| I dont know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Pam| Youre right, youre right. Im a middle class broad. 
Michael| Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybodys right. Theyre like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
Ryan| Yeah thats great.
Michael| So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So Im going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo! 
Dwight| Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
DeAngelo| Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
Michael| Think of it as part of your training.
DeAngelo| Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
Michael|  Okay, well well work on it.
DeAngelo|  Michael, Im very, very bad.
Michael| You are doing it.
Michael|  Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Kevin| Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Michael| Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
DeAngelo| That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
Michael|  Okay, okay. You know what, I didnt actually lose my keys...
DeAngelo| This did not happen.
Michael| Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now its all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
Ryan| Why dont you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Michael|  There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
DeAngelo| Uhhh, you sir!  Are we having fun tonight?
Jim| Having a great time.
DeAngelo| Oh good!
Jim| Thanks, yeah.
DeAngelo| Where were you on September 11th?
Michael| No! God! 
DeAngelo| This is so weird! If Im conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
Andy| Why dont you think of hosting the Dundies like youre just running a meeting.
Michael| No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Jim| Why dont you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Michael| Jim, please no loopholes.
Darryl| Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Michael| This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
DeAngelo|  Me mo. Me mo.
Michael| Good. Good. Good!
DeAngelo| Meee Mo, Mee!
Michael| Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
DeAngelo| When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
Michael|  Too personal. I dont wanna hear about it.  Lets try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you cant-  Thats right, youre not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect.
DeAngelo| THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! 
Michael| Say it with an accent!
DeAngelo|  THE DUNDIES!
Michael|  The Dundies!
DeAngelo| THE DUNDIES!
Jim|  I just dont understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Pam| Yeah...  Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Erin| Get away from the car, hes gonna see you.
Jim| Whos gonna see us?
Erin|  Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Jim| Get in the car? 
Erin| Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry.
Pam| Whats wrong?
Erin| I eat lunch in the car now.  Its my alone time. Its just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Pam| Why dont you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Erin| I, really dont like spending time with him.
Pam| Dont you think its better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
Jim| I think Im gonna go.
Pam| What?
Jim| I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!
Erin| Thank you Jim.
Jim| Im sorry, that just wasnt interesting to me.
Erin| I cant just dump him Pam, Im not like you, I cant be mean.
Pam| Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you dont love him. Just be honest with him. 
Dwight| 
Kevin|  Hi!
Dwight| Appalling.  Eye sore.  Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Erin| DeAngelo, Jos on the phone for you.
DeAngelo| Hello?
"Jo"|  DeAngelo! Were in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we aint got no host!
DeAngelo| Oh no!
"Jo"| Luckily I have someone for you!
DeAngelo| Billy Crystal?
"Jo"| Better.
DeAngelo| Neil Patrick Harris?
"Jo"| Hes in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! 
DeAngelo| Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta,  Get Him to the Dundies!
DeAngelo|  Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
"Angela"|  My boyfriend can, hes a state senator.
Audience| 
DeAngelo| Mmhmm.
Angela| Oh wait, he cant help because that title has no meaning!
Oscar| 
Oscar| Try Jim DeAngelo, hell be able to help.
DeAngelo| Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
"Jim"|  I totally dont know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Jim| 
DeAngelo| No one is listening to me! And Im running out of time!
"Phyllis"|  Well, what are you talking about?  Ohh! Ohh!  Ive fallen and I cant get up!
DeAngelo| Maybe I just need to look into my heart.  DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. 
Michael| Im here.  In a good way! Ive been here the whole time.
Oscar| The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Dwight| Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott.  Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers!  Was that part of the...?
Michael|  DeAngelo, what are you doing? Theres a live audience out there!
DeAngelo| Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
Michael| No, Ryan would never do it. Its too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! Its sort of our perk!
DeAngelo| This was not, part of the job description!
Michael| Listen to me, youre not doing this for me, youre not doing this for you, youre not even doing this for them!
DeAngelo| Who am I doing this for?
Michael|  Youre doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kids menu, wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say Its showtime. Get out there.  
DeAngelo| I cant. 
Michael| Say it.
DeAngelo| Stop, hitting me.
Michael| You can do it, just say it.
DeAngelo| Hit me again. 
Michael| Now hit me.  One, two, three.
Together| Its showtime.
Michael| Alright, here we go.
Michael| Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. 
DeAngelo| Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
Jim| Nope, go back to the script.
Michael| There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! 
Jim| Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if youre watching this at home its way past your bedtime, by the way howd this get televised?
Michael| Well done.
Jim| I dont know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I dont know, I dont know. Thank you!
Michael | Alright. 
Pam| You didnt think to mention me huh?
Jim| Didnt I?
Michael| Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Meredith|  Tell ya one thing, Im not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Dwight| Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Jim| I gotta go do this.
Pam|  Why?
Dwight| Big smiles folks! There they are. 
Michael| Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldnt be here tonight...
Ryan| How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, Im very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? Its, its so subjective.
Michael| Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson!  Come on up here you sick bastard.
Phyllis| I have diabetes too. You dont see me making a big deal about it.
DeAngelo| They say hes going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke.  No, I hate this, I hate it so much.  Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie.  Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan.  This is for you trashcan! 
Manager|  Who gave you those crayons?
Kevin| I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Manager| This is a cloth tablecloth! You cant color on it!
Kevin| Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Michael| You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?  Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonalds wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! 
Meredith| That is bull! 
Erin| Thank you, thank you! This is the first award Ive ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I dont feel it. And I think thats because Im not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Gabe| What?
Erin| Im not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me.
Gabe|  Well, this is embarrassing, um, Im obviously really angry at Erin. Its that quarter life crisis everyones been talking about.  Alright Im gonna go. 
Michael|  There you go.
Darryl| Damn that was cold.
Michael| It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. 
Audience| Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
DeAngelo| Hold on, hold on one second.  I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MENS ROOM!
Manager| Okay, okay. 
DeAngelo| THATS WHY ITS BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Michael|  DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
DeAngelo| This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. Its so much lighter!
Michael| Okay, were done! Thats it.
DeAngelo| Michael, are we?!
Michael| Were done. Were done!
Michael|  So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping itd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
Pam| Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Michael| What?
DeAngelo| I know Im the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
Michael| No, no. Youre being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Pam| Lets grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. 
Michael| So what youre saying is you kinda like it?  Ive fallen and I cant get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
Jim| I dont know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Michael| That got a big laugh.
Jim| That did. Pretty huge laugh.
Michael|  You were laughing right?
Stanley| I was.
DeAngelo|  You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
Michael| Were really close.
DeAngelo| I can just run over to the gas station.
Dwight| We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Michael| Thats true, we wouldnt get seats together.
DeAngelo| Okay, fine Ill hold it.
Michael|  You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.  
Dwight| I thought it was the worst Dundies Ive ever been to.
Michael| Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Dwight| Gladly! Id accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
DeAngelo|  Please dont stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, youre sitting in the backseat, baby.
Michael| What is your problem?!
Dwight| I just dont see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Michael| Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
Dwight| And next time, why dont you pick a co-host, that doesnt have microphone-a-phobia!
DeAngelo|  Look, what ever youre going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. 
Michael| He is in an all-out sprint.
Michael|  Here...  Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! 
Andy| A lot of people Id like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Michael| Oh, okay. 
Andy| I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
Darryl| 
Michael| Oh my God, somethings happening.
Andy|  Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
All| Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! Thats how many minutes, that youve worked here.
Pam| In costumes!
Jim| And impressions!
Toby| In meetings.
Erin and Kelly| And cups of coffee.
Kevin| For birthdays!
Stanley| More meetings and-
Women| E-Mail forms you made us read.
All| Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! Thats like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
Meredith| You hit me with your car!
Ryan| You helped me get off drugs!
Creed| I watch you when you sleep.
Oscar| I forgive you for kissing me!
All| Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
Kelly and Erin| Call, text or e-mail, or call.
DeAngelo|  Measure your life in love!
All| Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
Michael|  Yeah, okay.  Well this is gonna hurt like a mother.
DeAngelo|  Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh thats so mean!
Michael| No its not.
Oscar|  Its his last Dundies.
Jim| You gotta play along man.
Oscar| Come on Toby.
Michael| Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! 
Toby| I really disagree with this. I think its kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That mans being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and Im not so sure hes guilty any more.
