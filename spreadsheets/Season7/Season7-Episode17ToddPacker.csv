Dwight| I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything thats about to expire. Its nice not to have to plan my meals.
Kevin| Youre eating eight year old tomatoes?
Dwight| Theyre still good for another week.
Meredith| You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. 
Kevin| Ive got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. 
Dwight| Hardy har har. Okay picture this Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. Theres only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Jim| Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Dwight| No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlords gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. Its just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Jim| Three months.
Dwight| Could be.
Jim| Four months.
Dwight| I can see that happening, yes.
Jim| Eight months?
Dwight| Thats a realistic time line.
Jim|  Eleven months.
Dwight| Perhaps.
Jim| Okay now really think hard about this one  One year.
Dwight| I can see that as a very real possibility.
Jim|  Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Dwight| I can see that happening.
Jim| Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. Thats just...
Todd| I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different womens houses.
Michael| Still not seeing the problem here.
Todd| All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
Michael| It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look whos here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Holly|  Hi!
Michael| Hi. 
Holly| You must be Todd.
Todd|  Whoa! Im sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
Holly|  Very funny. Okay lets get started.
Todd| After you!
Michael| Oh, Michael! Thisll be just us.
Michael| Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, hes at his funniest when youve given him five shots. 
Holly| All right.
Michael| And it also helps if youve had five shots.
Holly| I already have.  
Michael| Whoa!
Jim|  Why is Packer back?
Michael| Is Packer here?
Dwight| Whys he talking to Holly?
Michael|  Dont know, dont care.
Holly|  Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Todd|  Oh!
Michael|  Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldnt be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Kevin| Yes! 
Jim| What!?
Todd| Its great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
Kevin| Nice! We got burned!
Michael| You did! You got burned, because Packers back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although hes probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Dwight|  Holly, you approved this?
Holly| Yes I did, I think Todds gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Jim| You did approve it?
Holly| Yeah.
Kevin| What dont you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you dont know what the word approved means.
Kevin| I have very little patience for stupidity. 
Erin|  Sorry were late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Gabe| Im such a klutz!
Erin| Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Pam| I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I dont wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right?
Erin| Thank you Pam.
Pam| Awwh, youre welcome.  My pleasure.
Jim|  Can I do something for ya?
Pam| I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Jim| Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Pam| So you know the feeling.
Michael| Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight| I didnt order anything.
Michael| And I dont have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we cant just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Dwight| Well theres a lot of seats in the annex.
Michael| So you wouldnt mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. 
Todd| Thanks man, itd mean a lot.
Dwight| I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Todd| well I was there for twelve years. Plus my names carved under the desk.
Dwight| No it is not.
Todd| Is too!
Michael|  Lets look at this.
Todd| Check it out! 
Dwight| I dont wanna move desks!
Michael| Dont be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Jim| Do I have any say in this?!
Michael| No!
Todd|  Dont even watch, Halpert!
Dwight|  Hey, whos dirt box is this?
Holly| Oh, thats our Zen garden.
Dwight| What do you grow in here, bullcrap? 
Pam|  Hey, um...
Holly| Hey, whats up guys?
Meredith| Dont whats up us! You think youre so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Jim| Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? 
Holly| Uhm.
Pam| Hes seriously awful!
Holly| Michaels recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, hes been nothing but nice to me!
Meredith| Thats how he gets you to take off his panties.
Jim|  Why are you nodding?
Pam| United front...
Holly| Okay, look. We cant fire someone because we dont like him.
Ryan| Right this isnt the U.S. Government.
Kelly| What are you referencing?
Ryan|  Everything... Everything.
Holly| Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something hes done?
Jim| Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Holly| Well if thats the case, I guess Ive gotta be fired too. 
Andy|  Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around!  Check it out! This guys on a full beam reach.  Theyre hiking out like mad! Lock em up! Lock em up! Nice job! Ughh.  This computers a hunk of jjunk.
Erin| Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! 
Andy| Where did you get this?!
Erin| Pam gave it to me!
Andy| This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer!  Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Pam| You have a computer Andy.
Andy| Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Pam| Ok, but listen. We just dont have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Andy| Well Andys desk needs a computer. And, I mean, its just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Pam| Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Stanley| So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Andy| Im not asking for one, I need it.
Phyllis| If youre just handing them out, I want one too.
Andy| Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Pam| See, this is what Im talking about.
Andy| What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Pam| Sorry Andy.
Todd| Hey whats going on you guys?  Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Kevin|  Mean but good!
Holly| So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Todd| I dont know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly shes great, but some days she acts like her mom. 
Holly| Well, some girls go through a phase.
Kevin| Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Todd| Since when did you learn how to read?
Kevin| I do know how to read though!
Todd| Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Kevin|  Hes right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Dwight| Kevin, in sumo culture, youd be considered a promising up and comer.
Pam|  What the heck! Why do you have Erins computer!
Andy| Its crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Pam| What? Erin is that true?
Erin|  I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Pam| Erin, its not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? Its not yours to give away.
Andy| Pam, when Im freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Pam| Im not freaking out, Andy.
Andy| -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?
Pam| Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Andy| Thats interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Pam| Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy| Seriously?
Pam| Seriously.
Andy| Pam! Come on!
Pam| Now please.
Andy| Fine!  Please make sure no one is humping me!
Erin|  Oh! If youre going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks.
Michael| Best day ever. Best day ever!
Holly| So much happening. 
Michael| Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Holly| No! No.
Michael| Please.
Holly| Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael| Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
Holly| I love you.
Michael| No. Not me, him.
Holly| Thats certainly opinionated.
Erin|  If youre not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Holly| Oh Im going.
Michael| Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think hes funnier than you? Oh honey...
Holly| I dont think hes funnier than me.
Michael| Hes funnier than me.
Holly| No, hes not funny at all.
Michael| So Im less funny than not funny at all?
Erin|  Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Holly| No, what Im saying is, hes not funny, but youre funnier than he is.
Michael|  Uhm...
Holly| Ok Bill Cosby , Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here  Todd Packer.
Michael| Thats insane!
Holly| Honey, hes a jerk.
Erin|  For Petes sake it just needs to be done! 
Todd|  So you two are married to each other now, right?
Jim| Yeah.
Todd| Thats sweet. Hows the sex?
Jim| 
Dwight|  Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Todd| Why?
Dwight| Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you Im cool. Youre the new guy. Its cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Jim| Thats a lot of reasons! 
Dwight| Drink it!
Todd| I think Ill pass. The only hot chocolate Im into is Viva A Fox. 
Jim|  Can I talk to you a second?
Jim| So, this hot chocolate thing.
Dwight| None of your business.
Jim| Well, you know you cant actually poison him. 
Dwight| It wasnt poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Jim| I really think we should join forces on this one.  
Dwight| Really.
Jim| What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Dwight| I know.
Jim| Here we go.
Dwight| Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Jim| Youve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he cant get to them.
Dwight|  Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldnt annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Jim| Okay! Well this isnt my best, but call Froggy101, say that were the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and were giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and its his own number.
Dwight| Who is Justice Beaver?
Jim| He... Its a crime fighting beaver.
Dwight| Why dont you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Jim| Absolutely, Ill e-mail you a hundred.
Dwight| Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and Ill read it over.
Andy| Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Pam| I dont know if theres really a private place in this office.
Andy| Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam|  You did that?
Andy| Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because were a little late.
Pam| Okay.  When did people sign-
Andy| Mind if I close the door?  What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Pam| Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
Andy| You humiliated me in front of every body!
Pam| Okay, well I didnt think about it like that. Its just, I cant do anything about it. I cant replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Andy| I mean, its pretty broken already.
Pam| Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Andy|  Pretty sneaky sis. 
Ryan|  Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. 
Dwight|  There are over four hundred of these! 
Jim| Yeah I couldnt cut it down.
Dwight| Theyre all good. So good! Number three eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four eat a dog. I dont know, um, from practical stand point-
Jim| One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Dwight| Eat a brog. Maybe its because I didnt understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.  Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Andy|  Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not?  Oh I hope you dont get sick Mr. Computer.  Why are you doing this to me Andy?  Because I hate your programs!
Todd|  And a 76 thats good to boot, I like that. 
Michael| And you made Hank smile, that doesnt happen often. Youre very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. 
Todd| Why?
Michael| I dont know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Todd| Holly said that?
Michael| Yeah.
Holy| She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
Michael| I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Todd| She asked me, Michael! It wouldve been rude not to answer.
Michael| Youve been on the road a long time. And youve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you cant be peeing all over the walls.
Todd| Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. Ive been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And its not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
Michael| No it isnt.
Todd| Youre right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Michael| Yeah, a little bit.
Todd|  Dont give up on me.  
Michael| I wont.
Michael|  Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin| I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Michael| Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Kevin| Thats silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Michael| Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldnt be apologizing to Packer. That doesnt make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Todd| Im sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Kevin| Well, like I said, I wasnt offended, but Ill stand here for the big show.
Michael| Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Kelly| Dont do it Kevin, thats the fake kind of apology.
Michael| Okay, go back to the annex.
Kelly| This is textbook. Its so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like its some offense to have feelings. Dont do it Kevin.
Ryan|  Sometimes you over react.   
Oscar| Michael hows this supposed to work? Packers gonna keep saying terrible things, and then hes just gonna make half-assed apologies. And were back to square one.
Todd| Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Michael| That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesnt speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parents expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Angela|  No! Dont!
Michael| I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And were through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
Pam|  So listen, we have to really scuff this up. 
Andy| No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think Im gonna make myself cry.
Pam| Andy, this is the deal we made.
Andy|  Thats probably good. Thats enough.
Pam| We should break this hinge maybe.
Andy| Lets not go crazy.
Todd| Well thanks, will do.
Jim|  Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jos a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what youre gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. 
Todd| That sounds weird.
Jim| It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jos kept her eye on you!
Dwight|  And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Jim|  Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Dwight| Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Todd| Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And heres the best part. Im a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also Im a huge boob nerd.
Dwight| Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and well get ya back!  
Michael| What are you doing?
Jim|  All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! 
Michael| I cannot believe this, youre sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Jim| Hes a jerk.
Dwight| He took my desk.
Michael| Okay, so youre tricking him into flying to Florida?
Dwight| It wasnt my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Michael| You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Dwight| No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what were doing.
Michael| He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Jim| Wait! Why dont we come up with a plan were all happy about? 
Andy|  Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Pam| Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Andy| Whered you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Pam| Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. 
Andy| All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. 
Todd|  Youre looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass", in Tallahassee! 
Michael| Yes, about that.
Todd| Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Michael| Well... I dont know if thats a good idea.
Todd| Do you have a ball and chain?
Michael| No, nothing like that at all. 
Todd| Listen, Im gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. Its your girlfriend, man. Shes uptight.
Michael| Sorry?
Todd| I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All Im saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, Ill introduce you to all the local  talent.
Michael|  Sounds great.
Todd| Its gonna be so good.
Michael| That is.  Its gonna be awesome. I think youre really going to enjoy it down there.
Holly| Im sorry about your friend.   
Michael| Nah, hes an ass.
Holly|  You ahh.
Michael|  You ahh.
Holly| What ah you wicked smaht?
Michael| No you ahh.
Holly| Who ahh?
Michael|  You ahh.
Daryl| So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Pam| Yep. Lucked out.
Daryl| Yeah, you really did. Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse. 
Pam| Yep, super lucky.
Daryl| Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
Pam|  Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Daryl| Really? Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Pam| Three. 
Pam| Im full on corrupt!
