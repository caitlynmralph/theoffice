Nate| Got it. 
Pam| Okay lets go in. Im freezing.
Michael| People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. Were gonna do a fun one.
Jim| One Charlies Angels. One. Lets go.
Pam| Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No ones putting this on their fridge.
Kevin| Oh, I got it, you guys, how bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, why I oughta, and the girls are like, lets go shopping!.
Andy| Lets just jump in the air!
Michael| Thats it! Thats a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. Were gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
Pam| Okay.
Nate| One, two, three.  Not everyone jumped.
Michael| Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
Nate| One, two, three.  Still some people not jumping.
Jim| You gotta be kidding me. Who isnt jumping?
Dwight| Ill tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Phyllis| I am jumping.
Dwight| You are? 
Phyllis| Yes, Im jumping.
Dwight| Let me see you jump.  Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isnt one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Pam| Im freezing.
Nate| Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. Shes on the ground by three.
Erin| I didnt want to miss it.
Andy| Well, if we all jump really high, well be in the air longer. Do that.
Oscar| Heres a question nobodys asking Is this worth it?
Michael| Dont answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where were all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Oscar| Why?
Michael| I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Nate| Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three,  two,  one,  zero. 
Michael| We didnt get it.
Pam| Im the office administrator now, which means Im basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
Pam| It hardly looks fake. Its so lush.
Jim| Whys it smell real?  Ah... good one.
Michael| Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! 
All| Merry Christmas.
Michael| Hows everybody doing today?
Erin| Good.
Michael| Hows the party coming along?
Pam| Great.
Michael| Are we over budget?
Pam| Nope.
Michael| No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Meredith| Not yet!
Michael| Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. Whats the problem?
Angela| Nothing. Should be fun.
Michael| So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
Stanley|  Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. Im doing fine.
Michael| Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Andy| Yea?
Michael| Whatcha got?
Andy| All good, Santa.
Michael| Well, thats a relief. Santas gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
Michael| My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because thats what I want. Thats what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
Kelly| Its present time, you guys.  Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Gabe| We just want to say how grateful we are.
Kelly| Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do."
Kelly| Its a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
Andy| Hello Kittys for girls.
Pam| Nashua got mp3 players.
Phyllis| Yeah, I dont even have a laptop.
Kelly| I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Meredith| Wow.
Phyllis| Oh God.
Dwight| Oh come on.
Kelly| I said, "I wonder." I didnt say, "I think."
Gabe| Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Kelly| Blankets, what am I, five?
Gabe| Erin and I make great use of ours.
Gabe| Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if were still dating?
Darryl| Ill take one of those pink pouches.
Darryl| I feel good today. My little girl Jada? Its my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things Ive never heard of. iCarly... You know whos funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. Hes got a nice way of talking.
Jim| Hey, its snowing.
Dwight|  Oh, my God! Its the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? Its not even a real snow. Look, its a dusting. Pitiful.
Jim|  Hey, Dwight. 
Dwight| Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Jim| Well, its not a snowball, cause its only a dusting. Right?
Dwight| Look at that. Theres a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Phyllis| Oh, dont be such a baby.
Stanley| Yeah, whos a little girl now? 
Dwight| You apologize to me right now.
Jim| Youve got something on your nose.
Dwight| You apologize right now.
Jim| No.
Dwight| Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
Jim| You got it.
Andy| That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
Dwight| No, Andy, its a snowball fight. Its not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.  Jim, let go. Let go.
Kevin| Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Angela| I wouldnt subject Robert to that. Hes a very busy senator.
Oscar| State senator.
Angela| I would not expect you to know what its like to date someone in the public arena.
Oscar| Who are you dating in the public arena?
Angela| The senator.
Kevin| Oh, right. The state senator.
Angela| We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptrollers wife.
Kevin| Oh, that would be impressive... if 
anyone| knew what a comptroller was.
Oscar| Well...
Angela| Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. "Angela..."  "over here, Angela..."  "here. Look here!"
Pam| Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
Michael| Yeah!
Pam| A party. Its not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Michael| Pam? Pam?
Dwight| Pam?
Pam| Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Toby| Hi guys.
Michael| Hi.
Toby| Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Ill be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Michael| Uh, because youve been on the Lam? Because the boring police have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
Toby| Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Michael| Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Dwight| Death to Toby!
Toby| Okay, thats hurtful talk. Weve talked about that. You know, I dont interrupt your announcements.
Michael| You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
Phyllis| Whats the case, Toby?
Toby| Well, I really cant talk about it, but its a very high profile case.
Andy| Is it criminal?
Toby| Yes.
Andy| Have we heard of it?
Toby| I dont know.
Dwight| Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Toby| Come on.
Meredith| Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Toby| Guys, its a really big deal. 
Ryan| Hes rubbing his neck. Hes rubbing his neck!
Kelly| Hes rubbing his neck.
Ryan| Hes rubbing his neck.
Andy| Oh, Scranton Strangler! 
Toby| I can neither confirm nor deny this. Lets just say Ill be up to my neck in jury duty. 
Michael| That was the worst joke ever.
Toby| Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Michael| Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
Toby| Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
Michael| What? What?
Toby| Yeah, uh, shell be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Michael| Hold on, Hollys coming back here?
Toby| Yeah.
Erin| Guys, whos Holly?
Michael| That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Erin| Wow.
Creed| Shes one sassy black lady.
Michael| Hollys coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
Gabe| Im not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Michael| You know what, well postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Dwight| Okay.
Michael| Cancel. Were canceling it. 
Angela| No, dont throw those out!
Michael| No, we have to cancel the party.
Angela| We can save that.
Michael| No, no, no, were gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
Andy| I bought these.
Michael| I know.
Andy| These cookies are fine.
Michael| Its not. Theyre not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Pam| Michael, Michael, wait we dont have, we dont have the budget for another party.
Michael| Well then everybodyll chip in, itll be fine.
Pam| I honestly think youre idealizing people here again, Michael. I dont think thats gonna happen.
Michael| You know what, Ill pay for it. Ill pay for the party. It doesnt matter. This is way too important. People, Hollys coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
Michael| Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more persons breath away.
Michael| We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but theyve never been cool.  The name is Bond... Santa Bond. Ill have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody cant get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. Hes not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! 
Angela| Just stop moving your calves so much while youre talking.
Michael| Well, this years gonna be different. Were gonna have fun. Its not gonna be tacky. Its going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. Its not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. Its gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
Angela| Maybe Ill bring my boyfriend. Ill invite him.
Michael| Okay. Sure.
Angela| I mean, unless theres any chance there could be press at this party.
Michael| You never know about the press.
Angela| Well, I only ask because hes a senator.
Michael| Could he help us with some parking tickets?
Angela| I dont think thats appropriate.
Michael| Well, then hes not a senator.
Angela| Yes, he is.
Michael| Okay.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Pam| Yes. But dont get too excited, cause I didnt have a lot of time this year.
Jim| Me neither. Whew.
Pam| Okay.
Pam| Ive been working forever on Jims present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. Hell take a memory or a private joke, and hell create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes bear man. Wreaks havoc on the office. Its really good.
Jim| 
Michael| Okay...  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
Pam| No, it has the little...
Michael| Pam, no, no. Hollys coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks its a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
Bass Player| Hi, Im looking for Michael Scott.
Michael| Yes, thats me. Come on it.
Michael|  Theres nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, whats better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
Pam| Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Kevin| I would, but I dont want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Pam| Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. Its just us.
Andy| I will help. Although my brid, my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, wont fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
Kevin| Yeah.
Andy| I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
Pam| Oh, do you mean Darryl? Thats a great idea. Ill ask him.
Andy| You know Darryl?
Pam| Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Andy| I should come along, just cause hes my, you know, hes my hookup.
Pam| Cool.
Darryl| Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, Ive been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine. 
Justine|  Im not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
Darryl| She did?
Justine| Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
Darryl| I dont know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
Darryl|  Dont come in, Im busy. 
Andy| Its cool, Darryl, Im here too.
Pam| Hey, sorry, I really didnt want to come in. Its just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and were hoping we could borrow your truck.
Darryl| Uh, no.
Andy| Come on, itll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
Darryl| No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Pam| Okay. Sorry. Well uh, well leave you alone.
Darryl| Hey...  You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Lets do it.
Michael| When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
Erin| Ive looked her up online... theres nothing about her. Shes made no impression on the internet.
Michael| She doesnt need an internet presence, you just know.
Erin| Oh...
Toby| Hey.
Michael| What the hell are you doing here? Youre supposed to be in the courthouse.
Toby| Uh, were on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
Kevin| Hi, Toby.
Meredith| What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Kevin| Yeah.
Meredith| That scowl.
Toby| I cant talk about it or Ill get removed from the jury.
Michael| And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
Toby| I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, were just talking.
Jim| 
Dwight|  Youve reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... 
Dwight| Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Jim| Stop! Stop!
Dwight| Ahh!
Jim| Oh... oh!
Dwight|  
Dwight| I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Dwight|  Haahh!! 
Jim| Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing em until he exhausted himself. And, uh,  then...  "How bout icing it? lol. Dwight." 
Holly| Hi.
Erin| Hello.
Holly| Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Erin| Im really sorry, I cant help you. Im waiting for my boss pretty friend to arrive.
Michael| There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for Gods sake?
Erin| Oh, youre Holly! Of course. Sorry.
Michael| Hello.
Holly|  Well, well, well, if it isnt Michael Scott. You old bastard.
Michael|  Well, I never thought Id see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Holly| Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
Michael|  Why, youre some sorta wise guy, huh?
Holly|  I most certainly am.
Michael| Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
Holly| Unnnnnnngh!
Michael|  Doh!
Holly|  Oh, Homey. 
Jim| Okay... Hollys back.
Michael| Hi. Hi. Oh... 
Holly|  Oh, huggy monster!
Michael| Oh no, not the huggy monster! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
Holly| Hi.
Kevin| Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Holly| Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Michael| Thats adorable.
Holly| Would you put those out?
Erin| To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Holly| Oh, its so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. Its like a party for limousine drivers.
Michael| Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
Holly| Oh, its fabulous. I love what you did.
Michael| Isnt it wonderful? We love it here. Dont you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.
Holly|  Watch out for my guns theyre both loaded. 
Michael| What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Jim| Aww...
Holly| Its a pea shoot...
Michael| This is weird. I cant believe youre here. This feels like you never left. Doesnt it?
Holly| Yeah, kind of.
Michael| Oh...
Holly| Oh...
Michael| Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy... 
Holly| AJ gave me that.
Michael| Well, thats understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
Holly| Mmhmm.
Michael| You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andys mom.
Holly| Why?
Michael| Because without Andys mom, theres no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
Holly| That is a really good point. AJ said he hadnt seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Michael| Youre kidding me. Ahh!
Holly| No. I know. I was like, "What? Are you serious?"
Michael| What a douche bag!
Holly| Get a life!
Michael| Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
Holly| We sat down and we watched them all in one day. 
Michael| Mmhmm.
Holly| Now hes the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Michael| Good for him.
Holly| Next day I found him in my bed.
Michael| Really? Thats creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
Holly| We live together.
Michael| Oh, you do?
Holly| He had a little note pinned to him that said, "Youve got a friend in me."
Michael|  Yeah, Randy Newmans the best.
Holly| Yeah. I love him.
Michael| Me too.
Andy|  Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Wont you be my Christmas tree.
Pam| Hey, how about this one?
Andy| Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
Pam| Maybe. I mean... 
Darryl|  I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think,  oh... pick a damn tree already.
Pam| Um, hey, Darryl, listen, its none of my business, but if I couldnt have Cece for Christmas, Id be really upset too.
Andy| I dont have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, Im going to kill myself.
Darryl| Jada dont want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasnt as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Pam| Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
Darryl| Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess thats something to do.
Pam| No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Darryl| How do I do that?
Pam| Bring her to the party. Yeah, well have Santa, and well play games with her. Itll be a lot of fun.
Andy| Yes.
Pam| Youll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Pam| Hey guys, the trees here.
Michael| Hey.
Andy| Nobody hug me, Im covered in tree sap, so...
Oscar| Why would someone hug you?
Michael| Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. Im Santa Claus. Welcome.
Darryl| Are you serious?
Michael| Its a sophisticated take.
Jada| He doesnt look like Santa Claus.
Darryl| No, he doesnt.  I told her Santa would be here.
Michael| Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
Pam| Who told you that?
Michael| Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
Phyllis| So is it an open relationship?
Holly| Oh, God, no.
Kelly| Well, youre almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Holly| Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Kelly| So wheres the ring?
Pam| Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Phyllis| Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Pam| You guys, I dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Erin| Yeah, I mean, maybe Hollys not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Erin| I dont get it! Im sorry. I just, I dont get it!
Holly| Okay, listen, Im gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose by the end of this year, were over.
Pam| Wow, an ultimatum.
Holly| Yeah.
Pam| It doesnt really seem like you.
Kelly| That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Dwight| 
Jim| Dont. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Dwight| Oh, no. Oh, no!
Jim| Stop!
Dwight| Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Jim| Okay. Okay. Okay.
Dwight| Huh? You like that?
Jim| Seriously!
Dwight| Huh?
Jim| Okay. Okay. 
Dwight| Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Jim| I just want it to stop.
Pam| So, cool right?
Ryan| Theres no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Pam| Okay.
Ryan| We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, its the bears quest.
Pam| Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Ryan| Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Pam| I mean, help, if its something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
Ryan| Well, it sounds like you know what you want.  Its also a little derivative of a serias called Bear Man. Did you look that up?
Pam| No.
Ryan| Okay.
Toby| Oh, Jim. Hey.
Jim| Hey, Toby.
Toby| Theres this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
Jim| No way.
Toby| Who looks exactly like you.
Jim| Thats increadible.
Toby| Yeah. No, its uncanny.
Jim| You know whats crazy?
Toby| What?
Jim| I cant reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.  Excuse me. 
Michael| I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you dont. And thats just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. 
Angela| Its so cold. Even with my coat on.
Meredith| Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Gabe| Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
Holly| You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Michael| What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
Dwight| I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Jim| What are you talking about? Youre the one terrorizing me.
Dwight| With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Holly| Dwights right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. Im really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Michael| All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
Dwight| Wait, what girlfriend?
Michael| I havent told you about her.
Dwight| I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Michael| Im a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think thats pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
Holly| I didnt know you had a girlfriend.
Michael| I do. She is.
Michael| Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it aint Tara.
Phyllis| So you went homemade this year.
Pam| Yup.
Phyllis| Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I dont think we can help you out.
Pam| No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
Phyllis| Are you good at homemade?
Pam| Look at this.
Phyllis| Yeah...
Holly|  Who did this? Its obvious to me Im not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else Im leaving.
Phyllis| Well, I dont think Erin seems to like you.
Erin| Thats not true. I dont know her enough to make a decision even.
Michael| What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting.
Toby| No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
Michael| Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isnt that nice? Thank you very much.
Kevin| Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people arent looking. You dont think... its not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
Michael| It is Christmas.
Angela| No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Michael| Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
Andy| Why would anyone frame you for that?
Jim| Okay, Im sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
Michael| Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
Holly| You think this is funny?
Michael|  I dont. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Jim| Yikes. 
Kevin| Oh no, thats, thats not happening.
Dwight| Dear God in heaven.
Michael| All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didnt mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
Holly| Michael, you have to let this go. Im with someone else. I dont feel that way anymore.
Michael| Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. Thats what Jim and Dwight thought.
Dwight| Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Jim| No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Holly| You made up a fake girlfriend to see if Id get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Michael| When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I cant do this." But then, with this other guy, you dont have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
Holly| Michael, Im sorry.
Michael| And we did this whole stupid party for you.
Erin|  No.
Holly| You guys, it wasnt my fault.
Kevin| Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
Erin| I really think youre better off.
Michael| Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
Erin| Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Jim|  "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese."  Damn it, Dwight!
Dwight| Didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
Stanley| So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Toby| No, they bring it in.
Stanley| You lucky son of a bitch.
Stanley| I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Jada| Daddy, Im bored. Can I read my book in your office?
Darryl| Sure, sweetie.
Pam| Jada, Darryl, Im so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
Pam| Oh, my goodness.
Andy| I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
Darryl| Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Jada| What kind of challenges.
Andy| Wahhh...
Pam| Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
Andy| No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
Jada| I dont know.
Andy| Do you know the other state?
Darryl| Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and hell tell us if were hot or cold.
Andy| The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out shes burning up because the star is right behind her ear! 
Darryl| And the games over seconds later.

Michael| Oh, hey, hey, no, dont run. Youre gonna slip.
Pam| Thats good advice.

Pam| Thats a sad story.
Michael|  Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Pam| Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everythings gonna be okay. 
Michael| No, its not. Its not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
Pam| I shouldnt tell you this, but... AJ wont commit to Holly. And shes gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose to her by the end of the year, its over.
Michael| Really?
Pam| Really. And I dont know about you, but I dont know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Michael| No.
Pam| So just be patient.
Michael| Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I dont want you to fall.
Jim| I surrender.
Dwight| I do not accept your surrender. Theres only one way that I would ever relent.
Jim| Anything. You got it.
Dwight| You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
Jim| Youre a psychopath.
Dwight| Ill take that as a no.
Michael| I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
Kelly| Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. Youre re-gifting this to me.
Michael| No, thats not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
Kelly| Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.

Holly| Hey, Im so glad you came down. Its been so much harder than I expected.
AJ| Hey, what happened to Woody?
Holly| Oh, okay, get ready for this. Youre not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
