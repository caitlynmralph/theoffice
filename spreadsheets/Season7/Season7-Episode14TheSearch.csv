Kelly| Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement. 
Erin| Oh my gosh!
Phyllis| Wow. 
Kelly| Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. 
Meredith| Sweet! Free Ring! 
Andy| Divorced?
Ryan| Just so you know, its totally amicable. Were fine. We dont need people here to take sides.
Kelly| The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Pam| Wait. Can you back up? Whats the story? 
Kelly| We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot. 
Ryan| Its not irrelevant. Details 
Kelly| And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Ryan and Kelly| I dont think I should be married to you anymore. 
Kevin| What?
Andy| Sorry, when did you get married?
Kelly| Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right. 
Andy| And you didnt invite any of us?
Ryan| We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time. 
Kelly| God baby, you know, peoples reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.  
Ryan| No, with the messed up laws in this country, I dont want to be married until everyone can be married. 
Oscar| You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and were ok with it. We agree its fine if you got married. 
Ryan| No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
Kelly| Ryan, I changed my mind. 
Ryan| Ok fine, you know what, this actually isnt amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side? 
Kelly| And who is on my side? 
Jim| All right. Bye.
Pam| Bye. 
Jim| Lets Go!
Michael| Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Holly| For what?
Michael| You broke up with AJ weeks ago. 
Holly| Dont you have a sales call to go on? 
Michael| I dont understand. I really dont. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
Holly| We dont know that. 
Michael| Sure we do. 
Holly| Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Michael| Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. 
Holly| Michael, I cant keep getting into a situation where I date whoever Im working with. Well, you can understand that. 
Michael| Yeah, I understand. I just dont agree. 
Holly| Well you dont have to agree. 
Michael| Yes I do. 
Holly| No you dont. 
Michael| Yes I do. 
Holly| No, you can have your own opinion. 
Michael| I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. 
Jim| Hes going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with. 
Pam| Aw youll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game. 
Jim| Thats it? Thats all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Pam| All right, whatd you do?
Jim| Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art. 
Pam| Whered you put it?
Jim| Whered I put what?
Michael| Lets go. 
Jim| Oh, sorry gotta go.
Pam| Say it. Where? 
Jim| Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, youre really getting warmer. 
Pam| The fridge. 
Jim| Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance. 
Pam| The fridge, got it. 
Jim| And the final clue... 
Michael| Lets go!
Jim| You know what, just think about it, youll be fine. 
Pam| Bye.
Erin| Holly is ruining Michaels life. He thinks she is so special. And shes so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like shes a perfect 40. Its nuts.  
Jim| Cheer up. We made a sale. 
Michael| Just drive faster. I want to get back. 
Jim| Well, Im going the speed limit. So...
Michael| Okay, fine. My feelings dont matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. 
Jim| Someones in a bad mood. 
Michael| No Im not. Im not in a bad mood. Im not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Lets just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? 
Jim| Alright, let me turn on some music. 
Michael| I need to pee. 
Jim| No you dont.
Michael| Yeah, I do. My word against yours. 
Jim| Alright. Well well be there in ten minutes. 
Michael| What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? Im upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. 
Jim| Alright, Well if I see a gas station, Ill pull over. 
Michael| Well I hope I make it. 
Jim| Hello?
Helen| Hi Jim, its Helen. 
Jim| Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Helen| Everything is fine. Babys fine. She has a tiny fever. Im taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about. 
Jim| Ok... 
Helen| A tiny thing. I locked her in the car. 
Jim| What? 
Helen| Shes smiling. Shes happy. 
Jim| Oh my God. 
Helen| Jim, I dont have a spare key. 
Jim| Just stay there. Ill be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. Hes coming out but I have to go because its an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please? 
Guy|  Hello? 
Pam| This is Pam. 
Jim| Hey its me. So uh, dont worry. Everythings ok. 
Pam| Whats wrong?
Jim| Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Youre not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Pam| Jim, what?
Jim| Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car. 
Pam| Oh God! What?!
Jim| No no no its ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. Shes laughing and shes happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra. 
Pam| Ok. Shes ok?
Jim| Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So heres the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet. 
Pam| Understood. 
Jim| And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me. 
Pam| Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off?
Jim| Nope. 
Pam| Alright, just call me after the doctor. 
Jim| Ok. Bye. 
Pam| Bye.
Michael| I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isnt here and I am worried that he has been abducted. 
Attendant| No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away. 
Michael| There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. Hes my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please! 
Attendant| Just make it quick. 
Michael| Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you dont have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it? 
Attendant| You dont know it. 
Michael| You know what, I can dial 411, get Jims number. 
Attendant| He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away. 
Michael| Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, thats enough. Ok. 
Holly| Its the gas station on Benet Street? 
Pam| Yeah. 
Holly| Ok. 
Erin| You know what? Why dont you stay and Ill go?
Holly| Oh no no no. Ill be fine. 
Erin| Its kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. 
Dwight| Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. Im going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.  
Pam| Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? Im not even kidding. Theyre pretty good.
Oscar| Which on in particular?
Andy| Yeah, which one? 
Pam| Well the first one has a surprise factor. "Im a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
Andy| Boo-yea! 
Gabe| No no. No no no. 
Pam| But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. 
Oscar| You suppose?
Darryl| Whats it say? 
Oscar| "Im suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again." 
Gabe| Ok.  No no no. 
Kevin| Red gloves. 
Darrly| Keep it real. 
Pam| You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging. 
Darryl| And I will take you all down.
Andy| You?
Darryl| Ive been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason me. 
Andy| Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton. 
Pam| Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes. 
Andy| Woo-hoo. 
Kevin| I cant wait. 
Dwight| Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type marsupial. 
Erin| He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox. 
Attendant| Yeah, he just left. 
Holly| Which way did he go?
Dwight| Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. 
Holly| Oh really? You dont think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Attendant| Shes right. He went that way. 
Dwight| Alright. Dont get a swelled head. Youre no tracker.   Lets ride. 
Michael|  Hey you guys. Listen to me. Dont get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. Youre so colorful. I wish I could understand you. Thats a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. Youll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  Im being serious. Seriously. 
Pam|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. 
Dwight| Has Michael checked in?
Pam| Oh, hey Dwight. 
Dwight| I asked you a question.
Pam| No, he hasnt. 
Dwight| Goodbye.
Pam| No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought... 
Dwight| Pam, this isnt a shopping trip. 
Erin| No.
Dwight| This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Pam| Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time its convent, I just thought since you are out... 
Dwight| Pam, Im obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up. 
Pam| Ok, well it wasnt obvious so... 
Dwight| No word from Michael. 
Holly| Oh. 
Pam| Ta-da!
Kevin| Ok, its two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. 
Oscar| Ok. I got one. 
Pam| Yeah?
Oscar| Yes! 
Gabe| Ok, Im sorry but I am going to have to shut this down. 
Office| Boo! 
Meredith| Why?
Gabe| Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. Its either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed. 
Darryl| Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. 
Gabe| Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. 
Oscar| Irony is such a critical... 
Gabe| Number two no pop culture references. 
Pam| Seriously? 
Oscar| Wow. 
Gabe| I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who dont get the reference, making them feel like the other. 
Darryl| Wrap it up, Gabe. 
Gabe| Ok final thing, and this is a fun one Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, lets all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre. 
Gabe| Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood.  Not every day. 
Gabe| Go get em. Start quipin. 
Oscar| Pam, I think Im going to send you an IM. 
Pam| Oh! Ok. 
Darryl| Send me one too. 
Andy| Yeah, yeah. Put me on that. 
Phyllis| C.C
Kevin| Ditto.
Michael| Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I dont have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog. 
Hot Dog Guy| Im not a pawn shop. 
Michael| Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
Hot Dog Guy| Wow. 
Michael| With that I can buy... half the menu. 
Hot Dog Guy| I cant just go giving away hot dogs. 
Michael| All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you dont sell?
Hot Dog Guy| Throw em away. 
Michael| Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why dont you just throw one away now into my mouth?
Hot Dog Guy| No. 
Michael| Okay. Youve just lost my business. 
Dwight| Hey. 
Erin| Hey, you were in there forever. 
Dwight| Theres too many brands. Wheres Holly?
Erin| She wandered off like an idiot. 
Dwight| Hey!
Holly| Hey. 
Dwight| What are you doing?
Holly| Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  Ill take my free stress ball too now. 
Cell Phone Sales Person| Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original. 
Holly| What?
Cell Phone Sales Person| You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me. 
Dwight| Tootenbacher. 
Erin| Orville Tootenbacher. Thats Michaels millionaire character that... 
Dwight and Erin| farts popcorn. 
Dwight| Of course. He was here. Shes the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Holly| Are their egg rolls really that big?
Michael| Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Waiter| No problem. 
Michael| Okay. Ill be right back. . Okay. You know what? Im sorry. Im sorry. I dont have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I cant do that to you fine people. 
Waiter| So you cant pay for your food?
Michael| Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Waiter| You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much. 
Michael| Well the number three is not such a giant feast. 
Waiter|  Mr. Chu! 
Micahel| Okay, all right. You know what? 
Waiter| You were trying to steal food from us?
Michael| I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. Ill be back later with the money. Im just gonna leave right now. 
Waiter| You cant. Well stop you. 
Michael| Well, I think I can get through the door. 
Dwight| Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian... 
Erin|  Its Michael! 
Waiter| He just left. 
Erin| You knew. 
Holly| What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Dwight| Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him.  This way, this way, this way? I dont know. Do you know?
Waiter| I think he was heading downtown. 
Dwight| Hes heading downtown. 
Gabe| So what, no ones even gonna try? 
Pam| Guess not. 
Gabe| Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. 
Darryl| You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. Youre a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.  
Gabe| Hey... 
Stanley|  Click the "x"
Phyllis|  Im clicking!
Stanley| In the box. 
Phyllis| I am clicking. 
Stanley| Woman, youve had a computer for years!
Andy| Phyllis!
Gabe| Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. Ill just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I dont want to be your babysitter. 
Andy| Oooohhh. 
Gabe| "Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat." 
Kevin| Nice!
Gabe| No, not nice. Terrible. Doesnt even include the fact that theyre dogs. 
Andy| Do the next one. 
Gabe| "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and youre dreaming youre a dog on a desert island. 
Darryl| Dreaming hes a dog on a island. 
Gabe| Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Phyllis| Well, if you think its so easy, Gabe, why dont you try it?
Gabe| Umm... "You dont have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, Im the only one here." Ha. 
Oscar| Thats tasteless, Gabe. 
Gabe| Tasteless?
Oscar| Tasteless. 
Gabe| More tasteless than this..."is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, lets pee on it."   
Pam| Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner. 
Phyllis| Yes. 
Kevin| Yes, well done! 
Oscar| Whos is it? Who wrote that? 
Phyllis| Yeah, who wrote it? 
Angela| Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe. 
Erin| Where did he go, Holly? 
Holly| I have no idea. 
Dwight| Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird thats chirping to you, "this way, this way"?
Holly| I dont know. 
Dwight| Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael were coming for you! 
Holly| Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, thats all. 
Dwight| All right then. Someone propose a plan. 
Erin| Okay. We fan out...
Dwight| Not you, Erin. 
Holly| Stop looking at me like that. Okay, lets just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. 
Dwight| That is the stupidest idea Ive ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. 
Holly| Look, Im not playing. Im gonna go look for him. 
Erin| Good. We dont need her. 
Dwight| Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... Im deep below the oceans surface in a submarine. A torpedos coming right at me. No. Damn it, thats just my own imagination.  Maybe hes bowling. 
Holly|  Michael? 
Michael| Hi.  How did you know I was up here? 
Holly| What are you doing up here? 
Michael| I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. 
Holly| Dunder Mifflin.
Michael| Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much. 
Holly| I missed you too. 
Michael| Really? 
Holly| Yeah. 
Michael| Can I kiss you?
Holly| Yeah. 
Michael| Okay. 
Phyllis| Maybe thats not the best one. Keep reading. 
Gabe| Uh, it was. 
Meredith| Maybe it wasnt. 
Gabe| "Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe."
Andy| Oh! 
Phyllis| No, thats not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Gabe| "I know what it smells like but I didnt roll in anything. Its from listening to all of Gabes bull.  "Isnt this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? Im Gabe and Im a weirdo." 
Andy| 
Gabe| "Gabes mom... hmm... Gabes mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her."
Phyllis| Yeah, there you go.
