Creed|   Its a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton.  Keep it running.
Creed|  Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate.  I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Creed|   Find out what language this is. 
Creed|   Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy,  and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Jim|  He never called a meeting.
Creed|   BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first "B" stand for?
Pam|  What are we doing?
Creed|  Were making acronyms. Okay! What does the first "B" stand for?
Kevin|  Um... Business!
Creed|  I like it! Business! Good, Kevin!  All right! The "O"...
Pam|  We need a new manager.
Jim|   Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Fred Henry|  Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
Jim|  Really?
Fred|  Yeah.
Jim|   ...What is it?
Fred|  Nice try.
Toby|  Im sorry, what is your three-step plan?
Fred|  Well, I mean, I cant just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then youll get the plan.
Gabe|  Well... its an interview, and we dont know that you really have the plan.
Fred|   Well, Im not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. Youre in paper, right?
Gabe|  How would we know that, if you dont...
Jim|  You could just be saying it to get the job.
Fred|  I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?
Jim|  How about this. Why dont you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Fred|  Tell you what. Ill give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
Jim|  Okay.
Fred|  Color-code sent documents, TM.
Jim|  Did you just trademark that...
Toby|   W-What?
Fred|  Thats a verbal trademark. Thats an agreement.
Jim|  We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branchs new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someones bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, Im not too worried. But Im really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabes last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Stanley|   Good morning.
Darryl|  Good morning.
Phyllis|   Good morning.
Darryl|  Good morning.
Phyllis|  Did you have a nice drive in?
Darryl|  I did.
Darryl|  I have a solid relationship with Jo, the companys owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesnt hurt that Im...  bla-aaack!
Andy|  
Erin|   Its good. I really hope you get it!
Andy|  The manager job? Nah, Im barely interested. I just cant not go for it. You know, its not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Erin|  Still, Id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair.
Andy|  Dont even...  EEEHHHH!!!!
Erin|  You in the bosss chair!
Andy|  EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Andy|  In my family, you dont really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I dont know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and...  well see what Rosa comes back with.
Erin|   Did you hear anything?
Phyllis|  Oh, Im sure theyll let us know when they get the results. 
Phyllis|  It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Erin|  So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Phyllis|  But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porkys had come out.
Erin|  Yeah. Im sure I was just another Porkys baby.
Phyllis|  Mm.
Erin|  But why not find out.
Phyllis| Yeah.
Pam|   Should you really be so blatant about that?
Dwight|  They wont make me manager, and I wont settle for anything less. Ive gone about as far as I can here. Thats obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Pam|  Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Dwight|  Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Warren Buffett|  Can you do any better on salary?
Jim|  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Warren|  What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas aint cheap, you know.
Jim|  Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Warren|  How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
Angela|   Okay.  How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senators office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Kevin|  The Botanical Gardens, Scrantons hidden gem. Dont eat any berries you dont recognize.
Toby|  How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Robert California|  You dont work in sales, do you.
Toby|  Uh... Human Resources.
Robert|  You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Dont be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Dont ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what Im telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
Toby|  Yes.
Gabe|  Okay, I-I am, Im almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position.  Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Robert|  Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Gabe|  No. 
Jim|  Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Robert|  Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
Jim|  Yes.
Robert|  That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction weve had already, you wont be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
Jim|  Yes.
Robert|   Yes. You do.  
Jim|   He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius.
Andy|   Good luck, Darryl. 
Darryl|   Thank you.
Darryl|  Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Jim|   Oh.
Darryl|  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. 
Gabe|  Oh? Uh... we havent started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Darryl|  Uh...  yes?! I was.  Little joke!
Toby|  So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Darryl|  I thought that was your job.
Toby|  Well, its one of my strengths, but its the managers job.
Jim|  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Darryl|  Ill answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. 
Darryl|   Whos that?
Jim|   So I think all we need is a resume, and well be good right?
Darryl|  I... I just thought you knew me.
Jim|  Yeah, its no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool? 
Darryl|  Let me...  Oh. Cool. 
Merv Bronte|   Did, uh, you just interview?
Robert|  Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
Merv|  What do you mean?
Robert|  That business cant attract anyone. Its awful up there. Those people seem like theyre in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
Merv|  Place must be horrible. I dont know if I want this job. 
Merv|   Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that Im gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that Im never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... Im gonna die here.
Dwight|  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview?  What are you doing..?  Stop trying to figure me out.
Robert|  I just did.
Dwight|  You cant.
Robert|  Its done.
Dwight|  No, its not.
Robert|   I know you now, your nature. Im done. Not worth continuing. 
Dwight|  Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper? How its made?
Robert|  I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. 
Dwight|   Get out.
Dwight|  Im gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? Thats because I just threw it in the ring.
Merv|  You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
Toby|  Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Merv|  Well, Id want to move further away, you know? Just... I dont want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Jim|  Can I ask why youre leaving your current job?
Merv|   Im leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really.  You know, all of em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. 
Jim|  Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Merv|  Im having a bad time. 
Toby|  Im sorry, if we did something to upset you, Im sure it was inadvertent.
Merv|   Wait.
Merv|  Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
Angela|   Thank you.
Pam|   Its gorgeous, Angela.
Kelly|  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Meredith|   Wow...
Angela|  Its a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Meredith|  Tell us the freaking story!
Kevin|  Yeah! Tell us a story.
Angela|  Okay. He took me to the replica of Monets Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, cause its so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senators wife?
Pam|   Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Angela|  Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? 
Pam|  Thats not accurate.
Angela|  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. 
Oscar|  Angelas engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, Im horrified. As a friend of Angelas, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings,  Im a little excited.  But overall, horrified.
Jim|  Andy? You all set?
Andy|  Okay, guys, its time. Its pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Phyllis|  Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Andy|   Augh.
Erin|  I think Andy should be the boss. Hes just so great. If Im being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Jim|  So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Andy|  For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... 
Gabe|  Whoa! Thats a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Andy|  I wasnt acc-, accusing...
Gabe|  Well, Tobys in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Tobys done a fine job.
Andy|  Right! I really wasnt trying to insult any, anyone.
Toby|  I didnt think you were.
Gabe|  I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think hes a rat, and I think hes responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Gabe|  How many windows are there in New York City?
Andy|  What?
Gabe|  Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Andy|  Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Gabe|  No... How far away is the Sun?
Andy|   Uh, 93 million miles.
Jim|   Is it?
Andy|  Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and...  333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Gabe|  Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! 
Andy|   I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Darryl|   Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was...  Clippy.
Creed|   First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. Ive got some bad news. Were going out of business.  Saving face.  Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this] 
Pam|  How is this on me?
Pam|  Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Creed|   Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
Pam|  Theyre the same picture.
Kelly|  Well, I manage my department, and Ive been doing that for several years now. And, god, Ive learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Jim|  Your departments just you, right?
Kelly|  Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Gabe|  Great!  Um, can we just... 
Kelly|  What was that?
Gabe|  We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... 
Kelly|   Am I not a serious candidate?
Gabe|  What do you want me to say? I mean, theres a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England.  Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay.  Um, what are your weaknesses?
Kelly|  I dont have any, assh***.
Dwight|   I want an interview.
Dwight|   Hows the family?
Jim|  Good!
Dwight|  Good. They good?
Jim|  Yeah.
Dwight|  Whats your daughters name again? Peepee?
Jim|  Peepa.
Dwight|  Peepa, how is she?
Jim|  Great.
Dwight|  Great! Oh, thats great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Jim|  No.
Dwight|  Now, listen,...
Jim|  Youre not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Dwight|  Okay, I know why youre saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Jim|   Okay. Thats vivid.
Dwight|  Im going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwights Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Jim|  Yikes.
Dwight|  Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Jim|  Well, you know how I like taking bribes. 
Dwight|  Ha ha! 
Jim|  Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesnt trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Dwight|  Fine. Ill do it without you, but youll regret this.
Jim|  Okay.
Dwight|  Let me get that for you. 
Jim|  Thank you.
Dwight|  Okay. 
Oscar|  Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Pam|  The Senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid.
Oscar|   So!?
Pam|  And dont say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Oscar|  I have a very strong suspicion.
Pam|  Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Oscar|  What bathhouse?
Pam|  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Oscar|   What?
Pam|  Forget it. Im never gonna know what goes on there.
Oscar|  My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Pam|  Youre in the gay mafia.
Oscar|  Youre thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older.  You sound ignorant. 
Ryan|  You guys, um, talking Senator?
Pam|  No.
Oscar|  No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Ryan|  Cause hes totally gay? 
Ryan|  Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 oclock in the morning.
David Brent|   Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear youre looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they dont see things your way? Then I aint that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? Youve changed your mind? Youre now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too.  When do I start? Yeah. 
Phyllis|  Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Erin|   I... I dont think I can do that.
Phyllis|  Bestiality. Yeah.
Erin|  Well, thats not my personality.
Phyllis|  If my daughter were asking me... 
Erin|  Yes?
Phyllis|  I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Erin|  I do really want him.
Darryl|  So, uh... here you go. 
Jim|  Great.
Darryl|  Hope its all right.
Jim|  Im sure its fine.
Darryl|  The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, howd he do?
Jim|  Howard Cline?
Darryl|  Ehh, thats not who Im talking about.
Jim|   Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Darryl|  Yes. How did he do?
Jim|  Hes an amazing man. Hes a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl|  Come on man. Im being serious. Dont joke.
Jim|  Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. 
Nellie Bertram|  First, Ill take down the cubicle walls. 
Toby|  But there arent...
Nellie|  Symbol of transparency. Thered be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. Id take your job, but Id reject the title.
Gabe|  A little un-specific.
Nellie|  Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
Jim|  Thats very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Nellie|  Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what Id do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebodys boss, and that person can fire the person below them.  At least once a month, the lowest performing person...  bye bye!
Gabe|  How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Nellie|  Well, Ill tell you how. Shall I? Ill tell you how.
Gabe|  Okay.
Nellie|  By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Jim|  I think thats probably all we need to hear from...
Nellie|  Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? Thats what Id do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. Thered be no desks. You just sit on the floor. 
Jim|  Thats very...
Nellie|  Youve got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee! 
Gabe|  Okay, thats not gonna be...
Nellie|  Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you dont, whatever, just talk to her! Shes a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. 
Oscar|  Is there a front runner?
Jim|  You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Oscar|  Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Jim|  No, not at all. In fact, Im not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, Im just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Oscar|  Well...
Stanley|  The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I dont have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Ryan|   Oh no, Stanley... youll live forever...
Stanley|  My next boss will be my last boss. Hell be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. 
Jim|  Uh--
Meredith|  You pick a crappy boss, youre responsible for my crappy life. 
Jim|  Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Oscar|  Are you? 
Ryan|  Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. 
Jo|   Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this.  
Gabe|  All right.
Jo|  Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Jim|  No, was it good?
Jo|  Ohh, Robin was good. Shes always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howards show though.  Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long arent we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin whos had two jobs in ten years at one company?
Darryl|  Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Jo|  Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
Darryl|  Paper material, maam.
Jo|  Paper material?
Darryl|   Pieces of paper. 
Dwight|   Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo|  Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Dwight|  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because Ive learned so much from them. Id like to be interviewed for the position.
Jo|  Ill interview you right now.
Dwight|  Okay.
Jo|  Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Dwight|  Its complicated.
Jo|  Yeah, but see... its not.
Phyllis|  I dont think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Pam|  Im a woman. I would want to know.
Meredith|  Yeah, you gotta know.
Kevin|  Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? Thats hot.
Oscar|  You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Phyllis|  You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Pam|  She does seem happy.
Oscar|  Youre right. Youre right. She seems happy. We dont tell her.
Kevin|  We dont tell her.
Pam|  Okay.
Kelly|  Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Jo|  Okay.
Kelly|  Uh,... can it be in private?  Dont worry, its not about you.  As Minority Executive, I think its my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I dont think its professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Jo|  Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix.  Oh for gods sake. Hes texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! Im roaming!
Creed|   Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. 
Jordan|  Who is our biggest client?
Pam|  Uh, just put him through to me.
Jordan|   Okay.
Pam|  Hello! This is... the client.
Creed|  Its Creed. FYI, Im starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Pam|  Yes.
Creed|  Hehehe, cool. Lets keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I dont want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
Pam|  Great.
Creed|  All right, thank you, bye-bye.
Pam|  Thank you, bye-bye.
Erin|   Jo, you have one more candidate. Hes a burn victim.
Jo|  Huh?
Erin|   Hes all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Jo|  No, send him in.  Who is this?
Gabe|  I have no idea.
Jim|   Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here youre French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight|   Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim|  Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight|   Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim|  What is it?
Dwight|   Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim|  Oh, thats my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldnt hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? Thats a travesty.
Jo|  I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question.  If he isnt here in sixty seconds...
Dwight|  Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo...  Its me. Im Dwight.
Jim|   No. No! Wait, but, I mean, youre Dwight, and then... hes the... 
Dwight|   Yeah.
Jim|   Ohhhh!
Gabe|  Very unprofessional, "Jacques." Or, should I say, Dwight.
Jo|  Lets just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
Dwight|  I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager youd ever seen!
Jo|  All that for this job.
Dwight|  Yes.
Jo|  Thats f***ing crazy.  Get outta here.  What a nutjob.
Jim|  This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."
Jo|  Okay, its fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, whos got ya excited?
Jim|  Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Jo|  Whos this fella? Went to Cornell. Whats wrong with him?
Gabe|  How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. 
Jo|  And thats your unbiased opinion.
Gabe|  Yes, it is.
Jo|  So its not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Gabe|  Oh, Jo. Jo, Im disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Jo|  Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Lets get you back to Florida. Well figure out something for you.
Gabe|  That sounds like a promotion!
Jo|  Its not. Lets get Kelly in here to take his place.
Jim|  Um... why Kelly?
Jo|  Cause Gabes tall and weak. Shes short and strong. Im doing an opposites thing.
Jim|  Okay.
Jo|  Howd my girl Nellie do?
Jim|  Oh, I didnt know you knew her?
Jo|  She didnt mention it?
Jim|  No.
Jo|  Integrity move. I like it.
Jim|  You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasnt a good fit.
Jo|  Well, Im not saying you must hire her. If you find someone whos clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Dont mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
Erin|   Ahh!
Oscar|  Erin, what are you doing?
Erin|  Ive been turned into a puppet!
Oscar|  Okay. 
Kevin|   Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Erin|  I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Kevin|   Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
Erin|  And theres only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Kevin|  Its good. Its just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Erin|   I need the most special thing in the office.
Dwight|  Silence?
Erin|  A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! 
Andy|  Hey, Erin. 
Erin|   Oh.
Andy| Whered you learn how to puppet like that?
Erin|   Ive done it all my life.
Andy|  Listen, Im really flattered, but I dont think we should.
Andy|  Erins my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didnt have that feeling, you know?  Arent there some things that you really want to like, but you just cant... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football...  Lets not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. Im not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? Im sorry.  I would go for someone whos more... shes great, though.
Angela|   Stanley, I wont be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Stanley|  Ill get over it.
Angela|  I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldnt afford?
Pam|  That was our dream wedding.
Angela|  Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions? 
Pam|   I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Angela|  Hmm.
Jim|  All right. Name.
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute.
Jim|  Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know.
Dwight|  You have to interview me...
Jim|  I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Dwight|  I demand more questions!
Jim|   All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Lets discuss.
Dwight|  Okay! If youre not going to interview me, then Ill do it.
Jim|  Yes.
Dwight|  What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again?  Thats a great question.  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Jim|  Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight|  Thank you.  Youll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think youre gonna like the call youre going to receive.  Oh, come on. Im just happy that I got this meeting. 
Jim|  Well, that was quick.
Kelly|   Very, very interesting. And you know what? Im impressed.
Jim|  Hes not a real candidate.
Kelly|  I dont know, Jim, cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Jim|  You took the deal.
Kelly|  Yeah, it was a great deal.
Jim|  Thats not okay.
Kelly|  I dont know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Toby|  Well, we could try him out for a little while...  and if it doesnt work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Jim|  What is happening right now?
Phyllis|  Is it true that youre making Dwight the manager?
Jim|  No, why would you think that?
Phyllis|  He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Jim|  Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Kelly|  That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Jim|  No, no, no. Not ever, cause thats not gonna happen.
Dwight|  Well, its not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someones getting a little power-mad.
Jim|  Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like Im going a little bit crazy.
Andy|  Tuna... Youre completely sane.
Jim|  Thank you.
Andy|  Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Jim|  Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Kevin|  Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Jim|   I suppose I am.
Kevin|  Okay... well what do I want in a manager?... let me see.  what do I want?...
Oscar|  I dont think he meant, that--
Kevin|  So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Oscar|  Go ahead.
Kevin|  What do I want?... Im looking for someone... who...  Everyone is listening to me. 
Oscar|  Can I say...?
Jim|  Yes.
Oscar|  I think it should be Darryl.
Jim|  Okay.
Dwight|  What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Oscar|  Kellys on your side.
Kelly|  Im sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, Im a singer, Im a fashion designer.
Andy|  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Ryan|  I want an outsider.
Jim|  Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Ryan|  No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesnt see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Pam|  A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Ryan|  No, youre right, Pam, lets just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Pam|  No, I want you to say that you think the best person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Ryan|  Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Ryan|  I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasnt good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But dont just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when Im in the mood... to be led.
Meredith|  I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Jim|  Hey! Hey! Hey!
Meredith|  Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy?  Lets hire that guy! 
Andy|  She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Gabe|   Gotta catch a plane.
Pam|  Ohh, hey Gabe, Im sorry, we... we didnt get you a cake or anything. Were gonna miss you.
Gabe|  Oh, well Im still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Kelly|  You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ughh.
Gabe|  Okay, you know what, you dont need to make that sound.
Kelly|  Im sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Gabe|  There are plenty of people who love touching me.  Im a terrific hugger. Ive been with a bunch of girls where thats basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Kevin|  Later, man.
All|   Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job. 
Ryan|  Take care, man.
Dwight|  Were gonna miss you, Gabe. 
Andy|   Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. Im educated. Im capable. I like all of you... and I wont make any changes.
Erin|  I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that Im standing in front of  and facing, and Im like...
Phyllis|  Yeah.  Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. 
Phyllis|  No, were not related. I got the call. But... Ill tell her some other day. 
Jim|  What about Darryl? We can all agree that hes a stand-up guy, right?
Angela|  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and theres a great, lively debate here, but lets think about-
Toby|  No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. 
Kevin|  Exactly.
Darryl|   Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing?  Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didnt disrupt your meeting.
Jada|  Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
Darryl|   Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Jada|  I dont know if hed be a good manager , but hes a really great dad!
Darryl|  Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Lets go. 
Phyllis|  It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Jim|  What? No, no, its not a vote.
Phyllis|  Then what was this all about?
Jim|  I dont know. This conversation really got away from me.
Kelly|  I dont care. They can just vote.
Jim|  No, they cant. Thats not how this is gonna work.  Were going in this room, were going to have a meeting. Were gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and shes gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there? 
Andy|  Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think Im about to do that.
Nellie|  This job? Oh, yeah, Ill get it. Jos an old friend. I think... Im her best friend. Shes not my best friend.
Darryl|  Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Fred|  No, Ive never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of...  Vance Refrigeration.
Merv|  Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. Its like Im afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.
Robert|   I will get offered the job. Thats a... call Ive received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
Finger Lakes Guy|   I want the job. I really do. Its just, the rest of my familys in the Finger Lakes right now. Im supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; theyll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
Dwight|  I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or...  I dont know. Something always works out. 
Creed|  You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Pam|   Is that right?
Creed|  I think you two should meet.
Pam|  Well, okay!
Creed|  Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. 
Pam as "fourth-biggest client"|   Hello! 
Pam as "ninth-biggest client"|   Hello!
Pam as "fourth-biggest client"|  Hi, how are ya? 
Pam as "ninth-biggest client"|  Ohho! Im good! Dont you just love paper, and things about paper!
Pam as "fourth-biggest client"|  Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Creed|  Its Kismet!
