Man| Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sundays meeting.
Dwight| Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Jim| Oh.
Dwight| This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Dwight| Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. Were often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
Jim| Im actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Dwight| No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
Man| Dwight, dont be bothered by your friends presence.
Dwight| What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leaders weird voice? Huh?  Dwight, dont be bothered by the . Over the line, Jim.
Jim| Im just looking for my phone, so... pretend Im not here.
Dwight| Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. Thats our official name, Jim.
Jim| Sounds good.
Dwight| Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. 
Jim| Smart.
Dwight| And the rest was just stuff.
Man| Go ahead and read it, some people werent here.
Dwight| Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Jim| Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Member| It was pretty cool.
Jim| Was it?
Member| It was fun. 
Dwight| It was pretty awesome.
Jim|  Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now. 
Michael| January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, lets switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, lets push through. Well do this.
Michael| Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Years or they break up. Now, if shes engaged, Im gonna go crazy, and Im gonna start attacking people. If shes not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
Michael|  Michael, I know what youre thinking. Hollys engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but its not.
Erin|  Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said its snot.  I am so sorry.
Michael| Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
Angela| Good morning.
Pam| Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Years resolution on them, Ill collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Dwight| Wow. Did your baby draw that? 
Angela| The glitter is blinding.
Phyllis| I think its good.
Pam| Its gonna be fun.
Pam| I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, shes awesome. 
Phyllis| I know Sue. Shes not that great. And you know her husbands in a wheelchair, right? 
Erin| Okay, champagne.
Michael| Happy.
Erin| Sponge.
Michael| Sad. To soak up my tears.
Erin| Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Michael| Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Erin| Ukuleles happy?
Michael| Sad, something to break.
Erin| Chocolates.
Michael| For you, job well done.
Erin| Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Michael| Both sad. 
Erin| And did you get the tickets?
Michael| I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Hollys favorite. I hope she doesnt call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I dont know. "Whats your name?" Michael.
Erin| Im really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, hell be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Pam| Oh, hey, guys! Id like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Years resolution board. 
Michael| Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
Kelly| What happened? Is there a ring?
Michael| So... high five me. Were back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Kelly|  Come on!
Holly| Theyre warm.
Michael| Theyre so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! Thats a good firm handshake. Youre hired! Yes, lets get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
Dwight| Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She cant keep those mittens on forever.
Michael| Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
Kevin|  Congratu-ohhh.
Kelly| Wow. 
Michael| Oh my God! Thats it! Thats it! 
Holly| Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Kelly| Yes, I told everyone. 
Holly|  Ha ha, ha ha! 
Kevin| Hey!  Right back atcha, bitch!
Michael| Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
Video Michael| Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe. 
Michael| Im trying!

Pam| Hey, Dwight, Im collecting resolution cards.
Dwight| Not doing that.
Pam| Why not?
Dwight| Ive achieved plenty and theres no better than the best.
Andy| Drink less caffeine. Thats a good one, Pam. Heres mine.
Pam| Learn to cook for one!
Andy| Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. 
Pam| Well, maybe youll meet someone.
Andy| No, some people dont just meet someone. Im fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. Its not a party at all. Its just sad. 
Pam| Angela.
Angela| Yes.
Pam| Make time for romance!
Oscar| Whos the senator?
Angela| My boyfriend.
Oscar| Oh, you mean the state senator. Im sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote the senator.
Angela| Ugh.
Dwight| Wait, its that easy? Thats not a resolution, thats just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that...  My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Angela| Oh, God.
Andy| Thats a good one.
Dwight| Yeah.
Andy| You know what, thats my new one. Im taking that one, too.
Dwight| Awesome.
Darryl| You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. Theres tons of cuties and its easy to talk to them. Hey, what book is that? Cool, lets hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa... 
Andy| The bookstore? 
Dwight| Its that easy?
Darryl| Ill come with you, show you how its done.
Dwight| Okay, Ill drive.
Darryl| My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Michael| Hello! Oh, somebodys got a new phone! 
Holly| Yeah.
Michael| That is neat. 
Holly| I got it for Christmas. Im so out of my league here.
Michael|  E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
Holly|  Holly misses old phone.
Michael|  Why?
Holly|  New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. 
Michael|  Bummer.
Holly|  Bummer.
Michael|  Reeses Pieces.
Holly|  Reeses Pieces?
Kelly| Oh, God, please stop!
Michael| I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. 
Holly|  Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, dont go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Michael| Holly doesnt seem to be engaged, but shes talking to AJ like she is. I cant figure it out. Do you think shes already dating a different AJ?
Pam| I dont think so.
Michael| When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
Pam| No.
Michael| But you did still love him.
Pam| Im not... Im not going to have...
Michael| Do you love him now?
Pam| No! Just talk to her.
Michael| No. Shed just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
Phyllis| Ill talk to her, Michael.
Michael| You think shed talk to you?
Phyllis| Why wouldnt she?
Michael| Thats true. Shes really nice. Shed talk to anybody. Why dont you bring Erin to balance you out?
Pam| Theres a plan.
Andy| All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Dwight| Ill take the entirety of the second floor.  
Darryl| I got that cutie behind the counter.
Bookstore employee| Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. Theyre really neat.
Darryl| Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Bookstore employee| Actually, its ten thousand.
Darryl| Holy , what? Let me see that. Its so light. Like a croissant.
Andy| Hi.
Customer| Hi.
Dwight| Welcome.
Andy| Let us know if you need anything.
Customer| Thanks.
Andy| Why did we pretend like we work here?
Dwight| Is that what we were doing? 
Darryl| Hey, howd you do?
Andy| Good!
Dwight| Good. Real good.
Darryl| Really?
Dwight| Yeah, yeah! 
Andy| We kinda nailed it.
Dwight| Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Lets roll.
Darryl| Cool.
Dwight| Okay. Whatd you get?
Darryl| A book about oceans.
Dwight| Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Darryl| No, thats uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Phyllis|  Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Erin| Want some company?
Holly| Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Phyllis| Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
Erin| I went to Portugal.
Holly| Oh, wow... you went together?
Phyllis| No.
Erin| No.
Phyllis| So, Ive just gotta know. Whats going on with you and AJ?
Holly| Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Years deadline, but um, it came and went... and, were still together.
Phyllis| You didnt break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
Holly| It just wasnt fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But were going to be just fine. Just fine.
Darryl| Whoa! Hold on.
Dwight| I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Darryl|  Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. 
Dwight| Come on, why not? Ive never been in one before. Im tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
Darryl| Im telling you, dont do it. Ive got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You cant unsee that.
Dwight| Well, we cant just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Andy| Hey, theres a roller rink across the street! Theres always chicks at the rink.
Darryl| What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Andy| I dont know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. 
Dwight| Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Andy| Roller derby practice!
Darryl| Were going skating.
Pam| The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Whos been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Erin| Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Pam| Cool! Heres a little way to go gift from Sabre. 
Gabe| Intercepted!
Erin| Hey! Gabe.
Gabe| Whoops.
Pam| Creed. I noticed you dont have a resolution on the board. Whats yours?
Creed| I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
Pam| How is it going?
Creed| Im having a little trouble motivating. 
Pam| One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. 
Michael| Or sooner.
Pam| Yeah. 
Michael| Thats not a joke.
Pam| But thats okay. Because its not about being perfect, its about trying.  In fact, why dont we go around and confess some of the ways that weve fudged on some of our resolutions?
Kevin| Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I havent yet. But its okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Pam| Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But thats fine.
Michael| Is it?
Pam| Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe Ill be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
Michael| Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 1201, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Kevin| Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Michael| What is wrong with you people? Cant you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothings stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
Creed| Well, I cant, I dont know how.
Michael| Youre just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know whats going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
Creed| My tombstones already made, thank you.
Michael| Just do a cartwheel!
Erin| This is all I could find.
Michael|  Eat it.
Pam| You dont have to do that, Kevin.
Kevin| I dont know. Im glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
Kelly| Why are you eating stem first?
Kevin| This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Ryan| The other way.
Kevin| Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Michael| No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Pam| Oh, Michael. 
Michael| Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
Kevin| God, I hate it.
Michael| I dont care whether you hate it! You said youd do it! 
Angela| All right!
Michael| Eat it!
Kelly| Youre killing him, Michael!
Michael| All right, all right, shh!
Kevin| All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Michael| Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. 
Kevin| Can I get some candy, or something?
Michael| No! You cant have any candy!
Oscar| Ill get him water. 
Pam| Okay, Michael, just settle down. 
Michael|  Holly Flax.
Holly| Yes, Michael?
Michael|  Not Michael, E.T.
Holly| Whats up?
Michael| Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. 
Holly| Oh, no, Michael, I dont want to talk about it with you. I mean, Im fine, I just... I dont want to talk about it.
Michael| Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
Creed| You think?
Michael| And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. 
Kevin| You were super mean.
Michael| It was insensitive and I am sorry.
Kevin| It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldnt be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Michael| I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. 
Kevin| Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life. 
Michael| Youre right. And I hope that we can still be friends. 
Creed| I dont think Im there yet, Boss.
Kevin| Well, I am. 
Michael| Okay, oh! All right.
Kevin| Im going to help you.
Michael| Okay.
DJ| Hey, uh. Its just you. Anything you want to hear?
Andy| Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
DJ| Okay. 
Andy| I said no hits!
Ryan| I just feel blocked. Like Im living, but Im not...
Kevin| Hey, Ryan.
Ryan| Yeah.
Kevin|  Hows your fart project coming?
Ryan| Thats real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Kevin| Me.
Pam| Kevin, dont! Come on!
Kelly| Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Pam| Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
Meredith|  Well, if you dont have to do em... 
Kelly| Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Ryan| Okay, no.
Kelly| My resolution was to get more attention.
Ryan| No, shes lying.
Kevin| Hey, Ryan. 
Erin| One, two, three.  I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Creed|  you!  you! God!
Pam| Okay, thats it. 
Pam|  Lesson learned.
Darryl| Sup?
Andy| Hey! Where did you go?
Darryl| To the arcade.
Andy| Oh, cool.
Darryl| Why, did you meet someone?
Andy| Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Darryl| Right on, son.
Dwight| Gentlemen.
Andy| And where did you go?
Dwight| Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Darryl| Right.
DJ| So, thats it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.
Dwight| Yeah!
Erin| You want to keep this?
Michael| No.
Erin| Do you want to keep this?
Michael| Yup.
Erin| Do you want to keep this?
Michael| You can toss them.
Michael| My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless its from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. 
Holly| Were gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Holly| I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, Im sure.
Michael| Look at where youre going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where youre going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
Creed| Mmmhm.
Michael| You ready to do this?
Creed| Yes, sir.
Michael| You know what? Im going to stay here as long as it takes.
Creed| I really appreciate it, Boss.
Michael| Its about you. Its about you. Go!
Creed| I did it!
Michael| You did?
Creed| The perfect cartwheel.
Michael| Okay.
Creed| What a rush! Thats all I had to do all year.
Michael| Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
