Michael| Actually, I am meeting somebody, but Im a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Deangelo| Ill drink to that. Im starting at a company this week.
Michael| Oh, really?
Deangelo| To begginings and endings. 
Michael| And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Deangelo| The moms and the troops.
Michael| Do not tell my fiance Im drinking on a Wednesday. 
Deangelo|  I wont... I dont know her.
Michael| Im moving out to the burbs... actually, Im moving further than the burbs, Im moving to Colorado.
Deangelo| Colorado! The sunshine state.
Michael| Yep. Dont mess with Colorado. 
Deangelo| Doing some skiing? 
Michael| No, no. I dont want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
Deangelo| Well thats just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Michael| You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Deangelo| Try it once, youre hooked. Thats my guess.
Michael| Thats what Ive heard.
Deangelo| Im an olympics nut.
Michael| Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Deangelo/Michael|  Summer!
Deangelo|  Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you...
Deangelo| You know, its funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
Michael| Really? What happened?
Deangelo| You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
Michael| Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Deangelo| Thats the way it goes.
Michael| Man, he is late. Im gonna call him. Do you mind? Im sorry. 
Deangelo| Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
Michael| No, Im here. Im right... Im at the bar. 
Deangelo| Im at the bar too.
Michael| You are? What bar?
Deangelo| Im at the bar. The bar thats located in the lobby of the hotel.
Michael| I... do not see you.
Deangelo| How long have you...
Michael| Im been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
Deangelo| Ok, me too.
Deangelo/Michael|  Sorry...
Michael| Whatre you wearing?
Deangelo| I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.
Michael| Are we both at the right place?
Deangelo| Which place?
Michael| I hear your voice.
Deangelo| I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
Michael| I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
Deangelo| Deangelo Vickers.
Michael| Wow... that is insane!  
Deangelo| That is insane, that is the right term. Lets get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
Michael|  Here we go! Are you ready?
Deangelo| I am ready. 
Michael| Alright! Here we go! 
Michael| This is it. What do you think?
Deangelo| Oh, shell do. Shell do just fine.
Deangelo| I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...
Michael| 
Deangelo| Did that? Did that just happen?!  We should.. we should write a movie or something! Im serious!
Oscar| Michael is leaving. And apparently theyve already hired a new manager. And were meeting him today. Its a lot to process. Paperwork wise. 
Kevin|  Nope! Its not Ashton Kutcher. Its Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! 
Michael| Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So, without further ado, lets start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers! 
Deangelo|  
Michael| Come on out! 
Deangelo| Hello!  How are you sir?
Michael| I am well, sir, how are you?
Deangelo| Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, its a part of me. Ive learned to cope with it. What else, Im just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
Dwight| Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Kelly|  Ill get that you guys. Dont... its just... you know...
Deangelo|  Ill help you.
Kelly| Oh, hi! 
Deangelo| Hello!
Kelly| Have we met before? 
Deangelo| No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
Kelly| Well, I guess Ill go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Deangelo| 
Kelly| And that is what you call a meet cute.
Michael| And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue its Deangelo the whole time!
Darryl| Kind of embarassing.
Angela| Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
Michael| I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Deangelo| Oh.  That was... lets see, wheres my replacement? Wheres the guy Im replacing? Why dont I look to the left? Hes sitting right there! 
Michael| Oh yeah... I know... thats what I was just saying... thats what...
Deangelo| 
Andy| That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these.  nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Deangelo|  Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
Andy| I wasnt even trying to make a joke. But I guess Ive always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
Michael| This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Pam| Well, it wasnt an affair.
Michael| Yes it was.
Pam| But, no, but we are a family.
Jim|  We made that.
Pam| Cecelia.
Deangelo| Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
Pam| Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. 
Pam| Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Jim| Yeah, they dont ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies. 
Dwight| Thanks for meeting me.
Michael| Are you kidding? Id come anywhere to see a turtle? Whered you find him.
Dwight| Theres no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Michael| You know me very well, Dwight.
Dwight| Thats because Im your right-hand man, Michael, but I cant do it again. I cant do it again for a whole new guy. 
Michael| Now Im gonna have to go online and look at turtles or Ill be off all day.
Dwight| I want to be manager. I just dont understand why I wasnt even interviewed for the job. Whats wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Meredith| That apple looks delic!
Deangelo| I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. 
Stanley| Deangelo, youre going to starve to death.  
Michael| So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
Darryl| Its cool that you like the southwest. Its one of my favorite regions.
Darryl| Its one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Darryl| I love the desert. Its one of my favorite ecosystems. 
Deangelo| Heres the great thing about the southwest; theres so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as youve ever seen. 
Kevin| Burnt! Its lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Angela| Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics? 
Deangelo| I did not.
Angela| Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, hes a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. Hes a great person to know.
Deangelo| Sounds very interesting, thank you.
Erin| Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Deangelo| Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
Erin| Oh, thats how Pam does it. I just copy her. Shes sort of a living legend.
Deangelo| Try it without using your name.
Erin| Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Deangelo| Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
Erin| Oh, assist.
Michael| I sorta like the old way.
Deangelo| I just prefer it without the name and I thought- Ive got to start doing some managing at some point.
Michael| I know, I know, Im sorry, but if its not a big deal we should just-
Deangelo| And it really isnt. 
Michael| Is that good?
Erin| Yeah, ok, good.
Deangelo| Well, Id like to change it, actually.
Michael| Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
Erin| What do you think?
Deangelo| I think a change would be nice.
Michael| You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. 
Denagelo|  Change it.
Erin|  ...Im so sorry. Sorry. 
Deangelo| Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I cant even look at you.
Andy| Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... 
Erin| Deangelo, did you order a barber?
Deangelo| Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Cant wait to hear the punchline.
Darryl| Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Andy| I... dont know. Help me.
Ryan|  That is so badass. So hardcore.
Phyllis| Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Deangelo| I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
Michael|  Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Deangelo| Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. Its not even close.
Michael| And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.  
Deangelo| Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesnt it?
Michael| It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Oscar| You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Deangelo| Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Michael| Well, we dont really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Deangelo| Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
Michael| Thats-
Pam| Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Jim| Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them da-das.
Pam| Da-das.
Jim| And what happens here is-
Deangelo| You know what, enough about your baby, ok? Im sorry.
Jim| We were... I think she was just trying to-
Deangelo| No, no, no, I know what youre doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
Michael| You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You cant say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Oscar| Well, Deangelo, Id say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael| Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you dont even really have to worry about.
Erin| Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Michael| Dont shave my lips.
Deangelo|  Whats up?
Andy| I dont mean to go into a rant here, but...
Andy| I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Andy| ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans dont. Im thinking, how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Deangelo| Lets not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
Andy|  I wasnt taking a position. Its just one of those things where- 
Deangelo|  Now thats funny! Thats funny! You walk much?
Andy| Yeah, right, I mean- 
Deangelo| Little click...
Erin|  Deangelo, this box came for you.
Deangelo| Thank you. Thats my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
Stanley| Need a hand?
Deangelo| Oh, thatd be great, thank you Stanley!
Michael| You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, lets not go overboard with the re-decorating, and Im still here-
Ryan| 
Michael| I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Darryl| So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
Deangelo| Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
Kevin| Interesting.
Michael| Deangelos great. I love the guy. But Im not sure hes a great fit for the office. And also, Im not sure if I love the guy.
Darryls sister| 
Darryl| Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
Darryls sister| Hey, hey, hey! 
Darryl| No, Im good. Keep them.
Deangelo| Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
Andy|  Lets see if they have my favorite teas in here... 
Deangelo|  Drink some soap!
Andy| 
Deangelo| 
Andy| I guess this is my life now.
Dwight| How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Gabe| First things first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they wouldve just looped back to me, so, its cool you recognized my role here.
Dwight| I left a message at corporate.
Gabe| Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. Thatll put you right on the shortlist for next time theres an opening.
Dwight| Cant you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Gabe| What recommendation?
Dwight| From when he recommended me to replace him.
Gabe| ...Im sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
Deangelo| Best whale watching easily the west coast. If youre going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called "West Coast Whales.  Because youre not gonna see them-
Michael|  Snack time! Its the witching hour! Its the sandwitching hour!
Kevin| Awesome!
Phyllis| Mmm, whatcha got?
Michael| PB and J, my moms recipe! 
Angela| Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Deangelo| I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
Stanley| What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Michael| I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! 
Oscar| Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut? 
Michael| What?
Deangelo| Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
Jim| Wait, so, you dont go into shock or die or anything?
Deangelo| No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
Michael| Oscar, here you go. 
Deangelo|  Youre getting nut particles all in the air!
Michael| No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Deangelo|  Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.  
Michael| No, thats good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are.
Oscar| Michael, This is insane.
Michael| No, its not insane, Oscar. Im been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, youre gonna throw it all away? No. 
Jim| Listen, youre the one who decided to leave. Come on, hes the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Michael| Well, who needs him. Guess its just you and me, Dwight.
Dwight| Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. 
Deangelo|  Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?
Michael| I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, youll be fine.
Deangelo| Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that youre leaving.  Bring it in, come on.  Ok. 
Michael| Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
Deangelo| I... Im adequete. Im half as good as you.
Michael| No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Deangelo| Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? Youve worked so hard, get your senioritis on. Its Lake Havasu time!
Micahel| Guess Ive been working so hard I forgot what its like to be hardly working.
Deangelo| Ok. What is the Native American girls name?
Michael| Youll figure it out.
Jim| Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Deangelo| Thats a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
Jim| Thank you very much.
Pam| See, we knew it! If he just met her, hed understand.
Jim| Were back in! Right?
Deangelo| I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled Babys I Dont Care About.
