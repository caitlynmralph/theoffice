David Brent| Oh, sorry, mate.
Michael|  Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
David|  What you doing?
Michael| English?
David| You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Michael| Oh no no, Im not picking on you at all. Youre English, correct?
David| Yeah big time, yeah.
Michael| Im working on an English character. Would you mind gi...  Its called Reginald Pooftah.
David| Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Michael| Michael Scott.
David| Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. Hes called Ho Li .  Thats what it sounds like.
Michael|
David| Herrow! Herrow!
Michael| I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
David| You cant do that these days. You cant.
Michael| No, no, no. And people dont understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
David| No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. Thats what she said. .  Ohh.
Michael| Thats good. Pleasure to meet you.
David| Where are you working?
Michael| Dunder Mifflin.
David| Any jobs now?
Michael| No, not right now.
David| Just let me know.
Michael| All right. See you around.
David| All right.
Michael| Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
Erin| Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
Andy| Thats actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard.
Andy| Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
Erin| Oh its...
Michael|   Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
Erin| Michael?
Michael| Nein! Im greek! My name is Mikanos.
Erin| Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Michael| Okay.
Michael| I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
Andy| Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Jim| Listen, this isnt a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Andy| Go higher. I get super flexible when Im nervous.
Jim| Wow.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, Im really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I cant be apart of this seminar.
Andy| No. What? You cant do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. Youre the charming warm-up guy,
Jim| I know.
Andy| If the seminar was a meal, youd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Jim| Im really sorry. I cant do it.
Andy| You cant. You cant.
Andy| I cant have this go badly. Im a terrible salesman, and I havent been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job Ive ever been good at.
Jim| Will you let me know when this whole seminar things over?
Pam| Whats going on? Do you know that guy?
Jim| I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Dwight| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Dwight|  How are the marks?
Dwight| What are some of your small business ideas?
Older guy| I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.
Phyllis, Stanley, Dwight| Oooh!
Dwight| Thats great. Theres a big, big future in that.
Phyllis| A lot of mines in Scranton.
Dwight| Um, what about you?
Younger Guy| Uh, credit cards.
Dwight| Uh-huh.
Younger Guy| My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
Dwight| Wow!
Younger Guy| Something with cell phones. Its like, every time you make a phone call Id make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.
Dwight| Right. Okay? Great.
Stanley| Great.
Dwight| You promised us whales. These are worms.
Andy| Theyre not worms, Dwight, okay? Theyre just people with tiny businesses. Theyre baby whales which is even cuter.
Stanley| Im out.
Andy| Stanley, youre suppose to close.
Phyllis| Im out too.
Andy| What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. Were suppose to be a team.
Dwight| Were no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
Michael| You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
Holly| Oh, I dont know, Michael. Im not feeling up to that.
Michael| Okay.
Michael| Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, its been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? Thats what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
Michael|  If-a you change-a you mind, why dont you talk to Mikanos?
Holly| Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
Michael| Ugh. Youre the fifth person to tell me that today.
Holly| Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Michael| Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
Erin|  Down... there.  Is "jlp" a word?
Pam| "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
Erin| No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!"
Pam| I dont think thats a word.
Erin| Im playing Scrabble with Gabe, and Ive never won a game.
Erin| The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far Ive seen "The Shining", "Rosemarys Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Pam| You want some help?
Erin| Really?
Pam| Mm-hmm.
Erin| Yes.
Pam| K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
Oscar| It means youre playing someone whos going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"?
Erin| Because Im playing to win. Im playing "moo", Im playing "milk". Whatever it takes.
Oscar| Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a...
Erin| Uh...
Oscar| A triple word.
Erin| Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
Oscar| Or moon.
Erin| The cow jumped over the moon.
Oscar| Shes stuck on that one thing.
Pam| No, it doesnt have to just be cow stuff, right?
Andy| Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and Im just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
Kevin| Andy, Im no Jim. The only way that Im Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Andy| Hey, thats crazy talk. I think youre great.
Kevin| Then I wont let you down.
Kelly| Cake.
Ryan| In you go.
Andy| Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
Ryan| Yup.
Andy| I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Ryan| And?
Andy| Can you do it?
Ryan| Okay. I dont... I dont like committing to things just like that.
Andy| So no?
Ryan| No, I dont like committing to not doing things, either. Thats just as big a commitment.
Kelly| Oh, baby.
Andy| What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
Ryan| Yes.
Andy| All right!
Ryan| Yes, Ill do it.
Andy| Okay, than you so much. Its going to be so awesome.
Ryan| And if I flake, I flake.
Andy| What?
Andy| Kevin, you open it up.
Kevin| Yep.
Andy| Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
Kevin| Go.
Creed| Creed! Ha!
Andy| Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Older Woman| Hi Nard Dog. Im Lu Peachem.
Andy| Lets get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Dont Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone.
Kevin|  Yes!
Kevin| There are some people who have charm and some people who dont. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Kevin|  Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an.  And then double it! .
Andy| Are you okay?
Kevin| No. Yes!
Andy| Here...
Kevin| No. Im fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that Im gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner.  . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!
Andy| Im really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Kelly| But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Andy| What are you...
Kelly| Who am I? Im Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
Kelly| It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch."
Kelly| I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. Its ringing.
Professor Powell| Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise.
Kelly| Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Professor Powell| Uh, why?
Kelly| Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Professor Powell| Um, there arent really ten secrets.
Kelly| Come on Scott, please? Its me.
Professor Powell| Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline.
Kelly| Mm-hmm.
Andy| That brilliant little bitch.
Oscar| A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there.
Erin| Wait. Why?
Oscar| Put the "q" there, sweetie.
Pam| I think theres better...
Oscar| Put the "q" there!  Sorry I yelled.
Pam| You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Oscar| Theres no theater in that.
Pam| Theres no yelling in that, either.
Oscar| Well...
Holly| What do you do in your free time?
Michael|  Practice Olympics.
Holly| Mmm. Do you like movies?
Michael|  I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
Holly| We have to try this out on somebody.
Michael|  Hello.
Hank| Look, you want to order something?
Michael| She will have a greekaccino.
Hank| I dont know what that is.
Michael| It...
Holly|  Its a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Michael|  I cant believe-ee. Its a miracle. She can talk!
Holly| No more brain damage.
Michael| No more brain damage!
Holly| Ahh!
Holly| I dont know.
Andy| Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton.
Creed| Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question Why are you here?
Andy|  Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. Well meet back up in an hour.
Gabe| I picked out our movie. Its called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
Erin| When I win...
Gabe| Ooh.
Erin| Were gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Gabe| It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word shes playing has a connection to her orphan past. Its possible.
Dwight| So whats your crazy business pipe dream?
Guy| Well, I started my own golf supply company.
Dwight|  Really?
Guy| Its taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.
Dwight|  Phyllis?
Phyllis| Hmm?
Dwight| Some of these people are for real.
Dwight| Hey, friend. Hows it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Andy| Thank you.
Dwight| Hey, you know what? Good news. Were back in. Lets go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Andy| Really?
Darryl| Ahem!
Andy| Excuse me.
Dwight| I got it. I got it.
Andy|  Hey, do you need a lozenge?
Darryl|  Theyre a bunch of jackals.
Andy| What?
Darryl| They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means youre almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Andy|  Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Andy| Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back.  Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. Whats goin on?
Dwight|  Youre gonna blow it.
Andy| Maybe. Only maybe.
Oscar| We got it! Wow! We got it!
Pam| Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
Oscar| Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
Erin| Yes.
Oscar|  Ah. No!  . Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have.
Erin| Apoplexy.
Oscar| Yes.
Erin| Got it.  Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
Erin| I played "ape."
Jim|  I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I dont think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Andy| Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
Michael|  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. Im going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since its a secret, and Ill tell you.   All, you have to close right now.
Andy| Yeah, I mean, Im getting to it.
Michael| No, youre not. Youre getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
Andy| Yeah, yeah.
Michael| Andy, whats the problem?
Andy| This is hard for me. Im a nice guy.
Michael| You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Dont let them down. Dont let yourself down, Andy. Im gonna go back in. Im going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?
Jim| Psst. You think this things gonna go much longer?
Pam| I dont know. Theyre still in there.
Jim| Ohh! Good-bye.
Pam| Stop. Out with it.
Pam| Heres the story. That guy in there is Jims childhood friend, Tom.
Jim| Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Pam| And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
Jim| I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Pam| And Tom...
Jim| Was in the green group.
Pam| And Jims mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
Jim| And thats what I told him.
Pam| Right. But howd you say it?
Jim| "My mom thinks youre too dumb to hang out with."
Andy| Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually youre gonna realize you need this. So the only thing thats gonna be different is youll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So whos gonna buy one right now?
Older Woman| Ill take one.
Andy| Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else?  Sold! Anybody else?  Yes! All right!
Kelly| Yeah bitch.
Andy| Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
Michael|  No, no, no.
Andy| But it was a pleasure meeting you, and youve got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
Kelly| Whoo!
Tom| Hey, you think its cool if I grab a soda?
Jim| Yeah, woah.  Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Tom| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Tom| Hows it goin?
Jim| Pretty good.
Tom| Its been a while.
Jim| It has been, yeah.
Tom| So you work here, huh?
Jim| Sales.
Tom| Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory.
Jim|
Tom| Cause youre so smart.
Jim| Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
Tom| Oh, barely. Im so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius.
Jim| All right, good catch-up.
Tom| Yeah.
Jim| See ya.
Tom| Wheres your jetpack, Zuckerberg?
Dwight| Andy. I didnt think you had it in ya.
Andy| Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. Theyre on the outside. Dont how you missed em.
Holly|  Wonderful seminar!
Michael|  Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
Holly| Michael, I should get back to work.
Michael| What? Come on. Its time for grapes.  Real fun day.
Gabe| So, I won.
Erin| I know. You get to pick.
Gabe| Well, thats actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e".
Erin| Yes?
Gabe| So I got us a compromise. This movies called "Hardware". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. Its some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
Andy| Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought youd really like it.
Erin| Theres a "Shrek" two?!
Andy| Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
Gabe| Nice guy.
Erin| Ohh.
