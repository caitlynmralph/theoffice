Michael| Look at that.
Oscar| Huh?
Michael| Nice!
Oscar| I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally cant wait to wake up every morning.
Pam| Okay.
Michael| She is a beaut!
Dwight| Cant beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Oscar| Yes, it is.
Michael| Oh, look at that.   Smooth roll.
Oscar| Yeah.
Kevin| You got it! Lance Armstrongs Bike!
Oscar| Yes.
Meredith| His ass was on that seat? All right!
Kevin| Nice.
Oscar| No, Meredith, thats not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Kelly| Im on Sheryl Crows side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Pam|  Michael!
Michael| Oh, god!
Oscar| Oh...
Michael| Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
Jim| Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Michael| I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
All|  Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
Dwight| Yeah!
Pam| Come on, Michael! Yeah!
Jim| Just steer more now.
Michael|  Oh, my god!
Pam| Not the car!
Jim| No! No!
Michael| Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
Dwight| How do I look?
Jim| Amazing. How do I look?
Dwight| Normal. Ugly.
Jim| Well, I do the best with what Ive got. Lets go.
Dwight| Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! Its weird if I come in slightly after.
Dwight| We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Jim| Hes not the Steve Nash. Hes big though. Hes kind of like...Scrantons Steve Nash.
Dwight| Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think theyll understand? Its condescending.
Jim| Im not doing that. Im just explaining.
Dwight| And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
Jim| Phoenix Suns point guard?
Dwight| No.
Jim| No? Nothin?
Dwight| No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Jim| Well, Im neither of those things, so...
Andy|  Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dans Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
Phyllis| What? Is Dan okay?
Andy| No, he died. Its Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Phyllis| Yes.
Andy| "Some Vermont-based alums can hear Broccoli Rob Blatt, 96, in the state milk lobbys new milk awareness song, Calci-YUM!, featuring Phishs Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song."
Phyllis| Oh, thats great news for your friend.
Andy| Yeah, yeah, its great...
Phyllis| You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Andy| I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
Dwight| Go tell her were here. Youre good with receptionists.
Jim| Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...
Dwight| Crap.
Dwight| Danny Cordray is the worst.
Jim| Well, by worst, you mean the best.
Dwight| The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Jim| So, the situation is the worst.
Dwight| Also, he slept with Pam.
Jim| No, he didnt. 
Jim| Tell em.
Pam| Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
Jim| What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Pam| Thats fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
Jim| Yeah, I thought you started it.
Pam| No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right?
Jim| Ahhh.
Dwight| Im gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Jim| Okay, great-
Dwight| Watch this.
Jim| -Im just gonna watch.
Dwight|  So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. Thats why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
Danny| Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.
Jim|  How are ya?
Danny| Good to see you too.
Dwight| What are you doing?
Danny| Oh, Im just here for the coffee.
Dwight| Like hell you are.
Jim| Dwight!
Dwight| Hes not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Michael| Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
Jim| Hey, its Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Michael| Oh, hey. No, Im not busy. Whats up?
Angela| What?
Oscar| You are busy! Were in a meeting!
Michael| Its Jim, Okay? Yes.
Jim| Listen, you gotta get over here, cause were pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Michael| You need the big guns, yes?
Jim| Yes.
Dwight| Whatd he say? What did he say?
Jim| The big gun thing.  Stop!
Michael| I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
Pam| You dont look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
Michael|  No, I dont have time for this. Are you kidding me?
Pam| You dont?
Michael| No! Okay.  All right.
Andy|  Knockity-knock, dont knock back. Just kidding you can knock; its your office. Do you have a minute?
Darryl| Im very busy with time-sensitive work.
Andy| Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that youre entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
Darryl| If you dont enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Andy| Im starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Darryl| Nah. I play for pleasure.
Andy| This is for pleasure.
Darryl| I wouldnt enjoy that.
Andy| Im willing to pay you.
Darryl| Oh, yeah?
Andy| Yeah.
Darryl| How much?
Andy| Sixty bucks a session.
Darryl| Thats crazy money. Ill take forty.
Andy| Yes!
Dwight| There he is.
Michael| Oh, no, thats a male model.
Jim| No, thats him.
Michael| That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Danny| Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
Michael| Nice to meet you.
Danny| Three of you guys for one sale.
Michael| Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Danny| Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
Michael| All right.
Danny| Its good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Michael| Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Receptionist| Hes ready for you.
Michael| Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, its showtime. Ready, one, two--
Jim| Nope, not doing that.
Dwight| Ive been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Michael| Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Jim| Showtime!
Michael| Its showtime! Oh...never mind. Lets go.
Michael| When I knock on your door, you know who it is; its Michael Scott. Weve been together forever and we-
Steve| Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael| You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. Were going to deliver to you on weekends.
Steve| Thats very generous, but-
Michael| And you know what else were gonna do? I cant believe Im gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so youd better shake my hand right now.
Dwight| Hes not kidding.
Michael| Shake it, shake it!
Steve| Michael, Im going with Danny.
Dwight| Oh.
Steve| Thanks for coming in.
Michael| Okay. Thank you.
Steve| Thank you.
Michael| Thanks, Steve.
Dwight| Jim talked too much.
Jim| No, I didnt.
Dwight| Yes, you did.
Michael| Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesnt even close the door?
Michael| How do I feel about losing the sale? Its like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
Michael| You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? Theyre a small company. Theyre smaller than we are. Whats our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
Stanley| We sell better?
Michael| Okay. You know what? You clearly dont care, so why dont you just leave?
Stanley| I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Michael| Why dont you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
Stanley| Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Michael| I dont know, your frame, your build-why dont you have a glass of apple juice and tell me youre not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
Phyllis| I could try to seduce him.
Michael| Oh, my god!
Dwight| I know how we can learn his tricks.
Dwight| What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Jim| Is that your office?
Dwight| Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Phyllis| Uh...
Stanley| Im outta here.
Phyllis| This is weird.
Michael| You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Jim| A what?
Michael| Like the movie.
Jim| I think you mean The Sting.
Michael| Paul Newman, Robert Redford. Theyre bank robbers.
Jim| Nope. Different movie.
Dwight| The Sting. The Sting.
Erin| Your two oclock. 
Meredith| Thanks, hun.
Jim| Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...thats it. Thats really all we were looking for.
Danny| Danny Cordray. Its great to meet you.
Meredith| Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Jim| Meredith Van Helsing?
Dwight| Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Jim| Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Michael| Shhh! Hey! Thats my mug.
Jim| You know this isnt real TV, right?
Michael| Yes.
Darryl and Andy|  Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.
Andy|  Please Mr. President-
Darryl| One second, one second, one second.  So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Andy| Yeah.
Darryl| But youre singing it.
Andy| Yeah, but Im using my falsetto.
Darryl| No, thats not a good idea. I dont see that as a very good song.
Andy| Yeah, well, itd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Darryl| Oh, I never sing with soul.
Andy| Thats a lie.
Kevin| I could sing it.
Andy| I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Kevin| But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Andy| Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder whos gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
Danny| Im gonna take off my coat, if you dont mind. Its a bit warm in here.
Meredith| Hel-lo!
Michael| Oh, no, no. No. Dont-
Dwight| People cant keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Michael| Testify.
Jim| Okay, hes not that good-looking. I dont understand why everybodys obsessed with this-
Michael| Yeah, he is that good-looking.
Dwight| Hes very, very handsome.
Michael| Okay.
Meredith| Thats a great set of shoulders you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine?  Sorry. Yeah?
Michael| Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin at him.
Meredith| Im sorry.  Youre here to sell me some paper.
Danny| Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, thats not why Im here. Im here to meet you, see if wed be a, you know, good fit.
Meredith| What do you mean?
Michael| Oh...my god! Hes making her sell to him.
Andy|  Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Oscar| Its pandering. And it makes me think you think Im stupid.
Andy| But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
Pam| Not really. Its kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
Andy| I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
Ryan| I-I dont think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Andy| Rude. And not helpful.
Creed| Well, I really, really, really liked it.
Andy| Well, that...really bums me out.
Creed| Youre welcome.
Danny| We should think of this as a first date. And I think its going very well, how bout you?
Meredith| Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Danny| Ha ha, okay, there you go! 
Michael| Stay-
Meredith| Shut up and let me do this!  You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Danny| Ive never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Dwight| Oh...
Danny| Well, well get this...
Michael| Oh!
Dwight| Oh, man!
Meredith| So, whats your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Jim| We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Jim| Youre an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Oscar| That sounds fake.
Jim| What do you mean?
Dwight| I told you! Youre an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Jim| Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Heres the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Oscar| Okay.
Jim| So youre taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Oscar| All right. I can do that. Then what?
Dwight| Then make him pitch to you.
Jim| Yes.
Dwight| We gotta see what hes got.
Jim| Exactly. You can do this.
Dwight| Okay, and remember-youre not gay.
Jim| Stop it! Its gonna be great.
Oscar| Okay.
Jim| And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Oscar| Meredith, I-
Meredith| Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesnt speak any English.
Danny| Hola. Que tal?
Oscar| Como estas, senor?
Meredith| Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
Jim| Who else we got?
Dwight| Okay. Youre a young hotshot from Stark Industries. Youve just bought this company. Meredith is fired. Its a whole new regime. Hes gotta pitch to you now.
Ryan| Okay. Stark Industries isnt real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Jim| Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Michael| Dont let us down.
Ryan|  Will do.  Wont do.
Danny| Yeah, sure.
Meredith| You smell like a Scorpio.  This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesnt speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Danny| You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Meredith| Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, Im-
Michael| No, no, no....
Jim| No, no, no, no...
Michael| Im goin in!
Dwight| Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
Michael| Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
Danny| Michael Scott.
Michael| I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Meredith| Please to meet you-
Michael| Dont! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
Danny| Hmm.
Michael| I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
Danny| But from where?
Michael| A surveillance room next to this one.
Danny| Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Michael| Yes. And its the sincerest form of flattery.
Danny| Or...crazy.
Michael| Well-
Danny| Im gonna go.
Michael| Okay. You know what, it wasnt just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Dwight| No!
Jim| No, no, no, no.
Danny| Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey!  Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
Michael| No, we dont. Heres-heres my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
Danny| What do you mean, my tricks? Theres no tricks, man. Im just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You cant copy that! 
Michael| You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
Danny| Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Michael| So, you will?
Danny|  No!
Michael| Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Danny| Get out of my way.
Michael| Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
Danny| I swear to God, Im gonna hit you. I didnt mean that. Im sorry. Im not-its just Im very upset right now.
Michael| I know, I know.
Danny| Im very upset!
Michael| Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
Danny| More freedom.
Michael| I can give you more money-theres your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-theres your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
Michael| Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
Kelly|  me!
Michael| O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
Kelly| Josh Duhamel.
Angela| Yeah, I can see that.
Michael| No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
Kevin| Hes like a better-looking Andy.
Andy| Thanks, Kevin.
Michael| No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
Oscar| Its hard to judge ourselves accurately, isnt it.
Dwight| Michael?
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Can I talk to you about something?
Michael| No, you may not.
Dwight| Its about this very announcement you just made.
Michael| I said no.
Dwight| Michael-
Michael| Were not-
Jim| Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Michael| Okay. Lets-all right, all right. Lets talk. Please dont let him leave.  Dont leave. Dont let him.
Erin| Gotcha. 
Jim| You hired him?
Michael| Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
All| Stay the same.
Michael| Okay. Well...get ready, cause its gonna get better.
Phyllis| Its not gonna get better; hes gonna steal all of our clients.
Michael| No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He cant now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, hes going to steal sales for us.
Dwight| Wheres he gonna sit? Theres no more seats.
Michael| He doesnt need to sit, hes a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
Stanley| Hmpf!
Dwight| Wheres he gonna park? Theres no more reserved parking spots.
Michael| Good-bye!
Darryl| Songs about truth.
Kevin| Yeah.
Darryl| Whats something you really care about?
Andy| Reverse snobbery.
Darryl| More universal.
Andy| Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Darryl|   Couldnt get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Kevin| Oh, nice!
Andy| Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-thats amazing!
Darryl| Go ahead.
Andy|  Which me am I gonna be today?
Darryl| Which me am I gonna be today?
Andy| I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Kevin| Or the me that stinks.
Andy| Oh, my gosh! Were almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
Darryl| Oh, dont worry about it.
Andy| Wait. Seriously?
Darryl| Yeah.
Andy| So were just, like, jamming as friends?
Darryl| One, two, three, hit it.
Andy| Closet full of mes-
Danny| Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Jim| Did ya?
Danny| Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
Jim| Im just kidding. She told me about it.
Danny| Oh. She was not into me.
Jim| Oh.
Danny| Obviously. I dont even think she called me back.
Dwight| You snubbed her.
Jim| Dwight, please.
Dwight| Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesnt wear makeup?  We like her better that way! And you steal clients, dont you? Dont you!
Danny| Okay...thats different.
Dwight| Oh, thats different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay.  So...youre gonna be workin here?
Danny| Uh...I mean-yeah.
Dwight| Welcome aboard.
Danny| Thank you.
Jim| Hey, crazy, um...so...thats it? Youre just-youre fine?
Dwight| Its after 500, Jim. Im not gonna take this home. 
Danny| Oh.
Dwight| Pleasure.
Danny| Thanks.
Michael| This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we dont even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
Kevin|  Suns in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
All| Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you.
Darryl| Ill be your croak monsieur.
Andy|  Ill be your croak madame.
Kevin| Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but Im here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Darryl| I find you absolutely ribbiting!
All| Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Andy| Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Kevin| Croak!
Andy| Ribbit!
Darryl| Scoopity-splash!
Kevin| Nice.
