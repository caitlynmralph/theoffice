Pam| We could get Deangelo flowers.
Dwight| No, you cant get flowers for someone whos in a coma. Theyll wilt before he wakes up.
Phyllis| Thats true.
Jim| All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? 
Dwight| Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? 
Jim| Nope. Baskets have it.
Jim| So as it turns out, unless youre a young child or a prison inmate, you dont need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. 
Jim|  Well, I really appreciate the offer, but Im just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I dont want to mess this up, right? Theres a consensus, people are happy.
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you.  Jordan, gather my things from my desk. 
Jim| Wait...
Pam| What have you done?
Dwight | Mose... youll never guess where I am right now. 
Mose | Aaaaahhhhh! 
Pam| Cant stay there all day.
Jim| Im coming.
Pam| Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim| Youd slow me down.
Jim| Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Lets see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mines at 1030, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Pam| Stop stalling! Come on. 
All| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
All but Oscar| ...under God...
All| ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
Angela| Amen.
Dwight| Excellent. Morning announcements! Theres been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Dont share it.  Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. 
Erin| Ooh, about what?
Dwight| Thats on a need-to-know basis.
Erin| I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight|  General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Jim| Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Dwight| Define foment.
Jim| You define foment.
Dwight|  Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Dwight|  Aha!
Kelly| Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Dwight| Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly| Its none of your business, actually. Its very medical and personal.
Dwight| All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. 
Andy| In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Erin| Oh! Darryls funny. 
Andy| I know, right?
Gabe| Hey, Andy?
Andy| Yeah?
Gabe| Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy| Sure. Whats going on? 
Gabe| Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy| What?
Gabe| Because I am. I need to get her back.  I cant be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Andy| No, this is horrifying. 
Gabe| No. I dont like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Andy| Were just friends, okay?
Gabe| Do you promise that?
Andy| Yeah, fine, I promise. Well never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe| No, just give me a second. I dont want anyone to know Ive been crying. 
Dwight|  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think youre doing? Whats this? Whats the Fist?
Jim| Oh, its just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. Its just a club. Guys talking, you know. 
Dwight| You expect me to believe that youre starting a rebellion?
Jim| Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. 
Dwight| Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. 
Jim| And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, its a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  
Kevin|  One...
Stanley| 
Andy| Pam, I have to show you this video. Youre gonna love it. Its Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. 
Dwight| I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Kevin|  No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed| He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam| You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed| No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch. 
Phyllis| He means the ice pack.
Erin|  200 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - 
Gabe| Im sorry. This cant wait.
Erin| Hes just gonna call back.
Gabe| Erin, I am in love with you. I dont believe in much, okay? I dont believe in horoscopes. I dont believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell dont believe in God.  
Erin|  What?
Gabe| Or maybe theres a God. I dont know. I mean, its just not a guy with a long white beard.  Or it could be. I mean, its possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief  I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum  out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail? 
Erin| Dwight doesnt trust robots to give us our messages. 
Gabe| Well... its just...  it messes up my rhythm. 
Erin| Im taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. 
Jim| Wow, youve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. 
Dwight| Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranhas a rescue. 
Jim| And the desk.
Dwight| The desk is a replica of Uday Husseins desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, Im a very busy man. Lets get right down to business. 
Jim| Okay. 
Dwight| Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that youll be on your best behavior.
Jim| I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Dwight| Dont make me fire you.
Jim| You cant fire me. Youre acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. 
Dwight| Dont make me pre-fire you.
Jim| You wouldnt dare. 
Dwight| Watch this. Youre pre-fired. And when Im promoted, youll be full fired. 
Jim|  If you get promoted, and if you havent fallen in love with me by then.
Dwight| What?
Jim| If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well thats pretty premature to think," but I always say, its better to be pre-pre-preprepared. 
Dwight| How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan| Im good.
Dwight| Everyone here thinks that youre a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which wont last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, youll age swiftly and poorly. 
Jordan| Why are you telling me this?
Dwight| Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they dont want me to know abou- Ohh... its a holster. 
Dwight|  Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin good.  Ohh...  Oh, what a day. What a day. 
Pam| Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Dwight| The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I dont know. I guess hes saying that hes proud of me. 
Andy| Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. 
Dwight| The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I cant walk around wearing an empty holster. 
Pam| Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight| Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela| Thank you.
Phyllis| You could put your cell phone in it instead. 
Dwight| Uh... hello! 
Kevin| You could put a banana in it.
Dwight| Why would I put a banana in my holster? 
Kevin| In case you werent hungry now, but you got hungry later. 
Pam| Dwight, no gun, okay? Dont make us call Jo. 
Dwight| Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! 
Erin| Andy!
Andy| Aah! Aah! Its so loud!
Oscar| My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that? 
Andy|  Eeeeeeee... Theres like this crazy ringing going on. I cant - eeeeeee... I cant find perfect C. 
Meredith| Okay, everyone make a list of whats lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Toby| Hey, what happened? 
Kelly| Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight| No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. Thats all we know! No. Thats not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. 
Andy|  Somethings definitely wrong.
Oscar| Ill look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela| Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. 
Oscar|  Firewall. 
Gabe| I cant reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight| Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Andy| I think I should go the hospital. 
Erin| Ill go with you.
Gabe| No! We really shouldnt be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl| Ill take him.
Andy| Thank you, Darryl. 
Darryl| Whats wrong with you?
Andy| Its my ear.
Darryl| Yeah. 
Andy| Okay, sorry. 
Toby|  Oh, I should get the accident report binder. Ive never used the gun violence forms before. 
Gabe| Im gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight| Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Dwight|  Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo!  Howdy, partners! Its me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And Im the rootin-est--  I cant do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and Im launching a full investigation.
Stanley| We all saw you do it.
Dwight| Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andys tie look like?
Erin| Navy blue. Little red anchors. 
Dwight| I have no way of knowing if thats true. 
Toby| I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? 
Dwight| Okay, really?
Toby| Would you consider this a terrorist incident? 
Ryan| I felt terrorized. 
Dwight| Come on. 
Toby| Oh, theres a whole nother terrorism booklet for that.
Dwight| I just really, really think we should handle this internally. 
Ryan| Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Dwight| Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But dont cross me. But youre the best. 
Andy| Hey.  Were back. 
Dwight| There he is! Our hero!  You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Andy| Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Dwight| Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal. 
Andy| Yeah.
Phyllis| Hows your hearing?
Andy| Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldnt hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Darryl| I was talking like this.  I dont feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me. 
Kelly| Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. 
Dwight| American Idol? What? No. 
Kelly| Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight| No. 
Kelly|  Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight| Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition. 
Phyllis| Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. 
Angela| Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin| Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight| I put everything back in the vending machine. 
Kevin| Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit. 
Pam| You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight| Okay.
Jim| Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, Im on the spot. I dont know. Um... you know what? I think Im good.
Dwight| Thank God.
Jim| Nope. When Jos here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Dwight| Whats jazz hands?
Jim| 
Dwight| Fine.
Dwight| 
Kevin|  What the  is that?  Oh, my...
 Jo| Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They dont seem to know theyre brothers. 
Dwight| Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Jo| Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim| Well, I dont know about that. Just wasnt for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Jo| Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. 
Dwight|  Well, what can you do? Life.
Andy| We have to clean this up now!
Erin| She had so much -
Gabe| Hey, guys.
Erin| Hey.
Gabe| Hope Im not interrupting anything. 
Andy| No! 
Gabe| Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?  
Andy| Uh...
Gabe| I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy| Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Gabe| No, I was not.
Andy| And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Dwight| Oscar, can you print out last years sale statements?
Kevin| Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.  
Dwight| No, Kevin, come on. 
Kevin| My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. 
Dwight| Kevin, not now.
Kevin| Hey, Jo!
Dwight| Okay, okay. Shh! 
Kevin| No, under the jacket. 
Dwight| Youre kidding me.  Oh God, what am I touching? Its moist. 
Kevin| I dont feel anything. 
Dwight| Oh, its so wet.
Kevin| Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight| I cant. I cant push harder!
Kevin| Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. 
Dwight| Okay, hows that? 
Kevin| Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight| Im kneading it!
Kevin| Dont eat it.
Jo| Dwight! Walk me out. Lets talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - its nice to have a little power, eh? Hows it feel? 
Dwight| Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. 
Jo| What?!
Dwight| I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All Ive ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jo| Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? Its not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you? 
Dwight| It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Jo| Beaumont-Adams is a girls gun. That just makes it plain stupid. 
Dwight| I take full responsibility.
Jo| Who else would be responsible?
Dwight| Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam| You shot a gun off -
Dwight| Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. 
Jo| Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. 
Dwight| Got it.
Jo| I love you, Dwight. But you dont fit this job. 
Dwight|  Jo, please... I will -
Jo| No, child. No. Its over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement. 
Jo| You three are my search committee. Youre in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? 
Gabe| Yep.
Jim| Yep.
Jo| Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, whos got the most experience in this office? 
Toby| Uh, well, we probably dont want to go just on seniority.
Jo| Who is it?
Jim| Hey, Dwight. Whats up?
Dwight| Shut up.
Jim| Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? Theres no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. 
Angela|  Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin| Another one? 
Darryl and Angela| Yes!
Angela| Seven, two...
Oscar| Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? 
Angela| Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Darryl| Nine first.
Angela| Nine, eight, five...
Kevin| Thank you.
Angela| Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six... 
Kevin| Nice.
Angela| Two, one...
Kevin| Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Angela| God!
