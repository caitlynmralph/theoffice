Dwight|  Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on!  Que? QUE?
Mexican Man| 
Son| We dont go with that man. Ive seen several men go with that man and not come back. 
Mexican Man| 
Son| Weve lost friends.
Mexican Man| 
Son| We dont know what he does with them.
Mexican Man| 
Son| I dont want to talk about it anymore.
Dwight| I pick up day laborers and tell them theyll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them its Canada.
Nate| Hola amigo.
Dwight| Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Nate| Si, yo muy bueno worker.
Dwight| Y el accento, donde are you from?
Nate| Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
Dwight| You speak English?
Nate| Yes, Im really good at English.
Dwight| Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Nate|  Okay.
Dwight| 
Angela|  Whos this guy by our cars?
Dwight| That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And youll be happy to know that hes taking care of that hornets nest that youve been griping about.
Phyllis| Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Dwight| Poor hornet.
Dwight|  I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly hell conquer the hornets...
Ryan| But if he doesnt?
Dwight| Hell die.
Kelly| What?
Andy| Uhh, beg your pardon?
Dwight| When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Nate| 
Kelly| Is that a blow torch?!
Pam| No. No no no! 
Dwight| Interesting choice...
Pam|  Yes!
Andy| Very very smart.
Pam| Yeah, go away. 
Nate| 
Employees except Dwight| No! No no!
Dwight| A bat! Impressive...
Andy| Oh its stinging him! Ow! Ow! 
Michel|  Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?
Erin|  Terrific!
Michael| There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
Phyllis|  God! Wow!
Michael|  Look,  Its a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
Phyllis| Thats no pimple Michael.
Michael| You mean cancer?
Pam| What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
Pam| Its just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Meredith| Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Its just a cold sore.
Michael| It is?
Meredith| Yup, just a cold sore.
Michael| Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I dont have acne. I have a cold sore. I dont even have a cold. I dont know how I got it.
Kevin| I know how you got it. 
Michael| How?
Kevin| Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Michael| What?
Pam| Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really dont know what that is.
Meredith| I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. Thats what it is.
Kevin| I never seen herpes on you.
Meredith| Because its on my genitals, genius.
Kevin| You have a penis?
Andy| Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
Michael| Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Jim| That was like, ten years ago.
Michael| No! It was like four years ago!
Kevin| Michael, youre at least forty six!
Michael| Why at least? If youre guessing forty six just say forty six. 
Kelly| Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Angela| This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Andy| You know what guys, why dont we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Kelly| I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Oscar| I dont even wanna know these things!
Meredith|  Hey guys! 
Michael| How did this happen, how did I get this?
Dwight| Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Michael| You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  Its me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
Dwight| What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Michael| Dont even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
Dwight| You may have...
Michael| Oh my God! What if I did?
Dwight| You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Michael| Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Dwight| You need to contact every woman youve been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. Its the right thing to do.
Michael| Theres no way Im gonna do that.
Dwight| Then I will.
Michael| 
Dwight| No, Im no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, Im no doctor. Im just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Donna|  Hello?
Michael| Hi Donna. Its Michael.
Donna| Michael, I didnt think Id here from you. How have you been?
Michael| I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
Donna| Oh no.
Michael| I cant even say it. H-I...
Donna| Oh my God.
Michael| ...R-P-E-E-S
Donna| Wait, youre calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Michael| No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Donna| Ummm, no.
Michael| Does your stupid husband have it?
Donna| No! He doesnt. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Michael| Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Dwight| So long Donna! 
Andy| Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
Stanley| Not again...
Andy| What do you mean again?
Stanley| Youre always asking for our attention.
Andy| Maybe like a year ago...
Stanley| Seems recent.
Andy| No, thats...
Oscar| Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyones attention, and it seems like youve done it on several occasions.
Andy| Everyone, Ive noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Phyllis| Oh! When you got your new phone, thats when you asked for everyones attention.
Stanley|  Thats what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
Andy| Its the worlds only international sport! 
Holly|  This is Holly.
Michael| No this is Holly.
Holly| No this is Holly.
Michael| No this is Holly.
Holly| No, this is Michael Scott.
Michael| Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
Holly| I am calling because, theres a terrible crash!
Michael| Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Holly| A lot of people.
Michael| Any nuns?
Holly| Three nuns,  from a Missionary in South Africa.
Michael|  Were they in the missionary position? 
Andy|  Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na.  Yeah, now youre looking at me. Anyone whos interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
Michael|  Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadnt been transferred?
Holly| Yeah.
Michael| We would have twins. 
Holly| I dont think wed have kids.
Michael| Mmhmm!
Holly| It was just for a few weeks!
Michael| Mhhmm! We would be married.
Holly|  Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Michael| Do what?
Holly| You romanticize things.
Michael| I dont romanticize th-  No...
Holly| Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
Michael| He had no arms or legs, he couldnt hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
Holly| You made ourselves to be more than we were.
Michael| We were more than we were.
Holly| I dont know what youre getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Michael| Ok, alright I gotta go.
Holly| Michael... 
Dwight|  He forgot to mention the herpes.
Michael| It didnt come up organically.
Jan|  ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers.  Gentlemen! Nice to see you, itll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B.  The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
Jan| How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew Id tell you.
Michael| Its nice to see you doing so well.
Jan| Yeah Im really happy. Me and Astrid against the world.  Were loving it, yeah. Im kind of a supermom.
Michael| Bringing home the bacon.
Jan| Yeah.  Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget...  I love that commercial.
Dwight| I dont understand the reference.
Jan| Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Dwight| We had to come over right away, its urgent. Michael has something to tell you. 
Jan| Are you gonna keep me in suspense? 
Michael|  Would you excuse us...
Dwight| Ok Im gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater thats open to visitors? Never mind Ill find it.
Michael| He hasnt changed.
Jan| No, so what couldnt wait?
Michael| Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Jan| Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Michael| What?
Jan| You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, Im in.
Andy| So, guys. Ive been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office were better than that. Ok, now Im going to show you a picture of genitalia. 
Erin| Andy...
Andy| What, is it because hes black?
Jim| Nope, its because its genitalia.
Andy| Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now Im going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. 
Jim| Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Andy| Its normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? Its just as normal as anyone elses.
Jan| No! In the beginning we were not good.
Michael| Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
Jan| Well if theres anything exciting about it its because we both knew it was wrong!
Michael| Because we work together.
Jan| No, ok. Imagine theres a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesnt like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesnt like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Michael| Am I the princess?
Jan| No Im the princess, and the queen.
Michael|  Ok, so Im the guy at the station.
Astrid| Mommy!
Jan| Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
Astrid| It was cool.
Jan|  What did you learn?
Astrid| What did I learn?
Jan| You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that were all, sisters and brothers.
Michael| I have herpes.
Michael| I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
Andy| Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
Kevin| It feels unbelievable!
Andy|  Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Kevin| ...unbelievable.
Phyllis| The ability to express love physically. Its a magical thing.
Andy| Express love, magical.
Kevin| It feels amazing!
Andy| Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
Kevin| Yes.
Andy| Then I will write it down.
Creed| The feeling of pure risk.
Andy| I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
Creed| Its thrilling.
Andy| Ok, umm. Ill move that. Thrill of risk.
Erin| Andy, arent there also negatives to sex?
Andy| Yes! Thank you! Such as?
Erin| Unplanned pregnancy.
Andy| Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
Kelly| Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
Kevin| Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Pam| Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Jim| Good!
Darryl| Im sure they dont regret having their child, lets move it to the pros.
Jim and Pam| Thank you!
Andy| Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
Dwight| Next stop is Helene. Youre gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. Ill remind you.
Michael| You know, I dont know if I trust Jans judgment. She...
Dwight| Jan knows paper.
Michael| No, Im not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
Dwight| Wait, what Holly said?
Michael| Yes, I dont...
Dwight| Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Michael| I know, I know.
Dwight| Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Michael| Got it.
Dwight| TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Michael| IM TRYING! GOD!
Michael|  Hi stranger! Long time!
Old Woman| Who are you?
Michael| Im Michael. We dated for a while.
Old Woman| I dont think so...
Helene| Michael?
Michael| Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Dwight| Come on old lady. Lets go.
Old Woman| What is happening? 
Dwight| Come on.
Andy| Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Darryl| Condoms.
Andy| Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
Darryl| Ohh. Ok. I didnt realize we were doing trick questions. Whats the safest way to go skiing? Dont ski! 
Andy| I just thought Id bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. Thats all.  Anybody?
Pam| Andy thats way too personal of a question.
Andy| Well someone could answer if they want to.  Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. 
Andy| What?
Oscar| Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Andy| Well Im not gonna use my penis, Oscar! Its not exactly hard right now anyway. 
Meredith| Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Andy| Im doing this for you Meredith!
Meredith| I didnt want you it!
Andy| Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what Im doing right now?! 
Helene| Itll go away in time just dont touch it.
Michael| Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
Helene| What did you think we were?
Michael| Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Helene| I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this shows ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
Michael| Jerk. 
Dwight| Michael! 
Carroll| So this is the chefs kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.
Michael| Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
Carroll| Michael.
Michael| Carroll, how are you?
Carroll| Im great! How are you?
Michael| Im great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, Im going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
Carroll| You didnt call my office and ask where I was?
Michael| No.
Carroll| Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
Michael| Weird...
Carroll| Yeah.
Michael| He sounds like a nice guy.
Andy| I dont know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Gabe| This wasnt really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Andy| How is that relevant to anything?
Gabe| I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand. I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Andy| The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
Gabe| Ill let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
Michael| Oh wow another living room!
Carroll| Its a family room.
Michael| You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Carroll| Michael why are you here?
Michael| Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
Carroll| You know, we all do that.
Michael| I have herpes.
Carroll| What? Did you have that while we were together?
Michael| I just found out today. Its, uh, right there.
Carroll| Oh! Oh, thats what youre talking about?
Michael| Mmhmm, Im sorry.
Carroll| Did the doctor check it out?
Michael| Im between specialists right now.
Carroll| Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.
Michael| Well I believe in love at first sight.
Carrol| Well so do I, but we didnt love each other at first either. I dont know what you were thinking!
Michael| I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Dwight|  Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didnt they?
Carroll| No.
Darryl|  We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
Andy| No Im just sweating.
Darryl| I dont know whos got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Andy| Im not crying Im just sweating.
Darryl| Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. Its all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
Andy| Ok.
Darryl| Yeah.
Darryl| I have no idea what his problem is, thats just my standard advice. Its good advice right?
Holly|  This is Holly Flax, I cant come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. 
Michael| Hi Holly its Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. Its just. You know?  Its weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? Youre wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I dont feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didnt joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I dont know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
Oscar| What is this about?
Michael| Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
Oscar| Yes!
Michael| You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Oscar| What?
Michael| Herpes duplex.
Dwight| It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Michael| I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Oscar| We were never lovers!
Dwight| Im gonna need a list of every man youve ever had sex with. Im talking train stations, mens rooms...
Michael| Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
Dwight| Fence with a hole in it..
Michael| Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
Dwight| The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folks home.
Michael| An electric car dealership. 
Dwight| The democratic primaries,
Michael| Oscar! Think abou- Think!
