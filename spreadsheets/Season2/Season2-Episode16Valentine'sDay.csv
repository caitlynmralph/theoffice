Pam| I really like Valentines Day in this office. Its kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwights head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
Pam|  Phyllis.
Delivery man| Would you sign here? 
Pam| Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
Meredith| "Happy Valentines Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
Phyllis| Isnt he sweet?
Meredith| Yeah. Wow.
Michael| Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Dwight| And you want me to come with you.
Michael| Nope. The opposite of that. 
Dwight| I will stay here and run things on this end.
Michael| Ok, good.
Dwight| Question. Will you be seeing Jan when youre in New York?
Michael| I probably will, why do you ask?
Dwight| Well... Its Valentines Day, and you guys, you know... 
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| Screwed.
Michael| 
What| is your problem?
Michael| This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentines Day. Its New York. City of Love. 
Michael| Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything? 
Pam| Thats OK. 
Michael| Alright.
Oscar| The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. 
Michael| Dude, Im gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Michael| Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. 
Jim| So I broke up with Katy and havent been dating anybody else, so this year I dont have to worry about Valentines Day. Its gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. Were gonna play some cards and Ill end up winning a lotta money. Because, theyre idiots. Its gonna be great. 
Dwight| Whats this? What is this? 
Jim| I dunno, its on 
your| desk. 
Dwight| Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
Jim| It was there when I sat down. 
Dwight|  Happy Valentines Day.  Its me. Im the bobble head. Yes!  Ahh!
Michael| The meeting isnt til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And Im gonna go get me a New York slice. 
Jim| Hey Kelly. Whats up?
Kelly| Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Jim| OH, thats great. Im really happy for 
Kelly| And it was so funny cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasnt making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, whats taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didnt know what to say. 
Jim| Wow.
Kelly| So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that? 
Jim| Wow.
Kelly| Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? Im embarrassed. 
Jim| No, dont be.
Kelly| Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Jim| I bet.
Kelly| So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend. 
Jim| Alright. 
Ryan|  I hooked up with her on February 13th. 
Michael| Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when youre in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, thats pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here. 
Kevin| Woah. 
Pam| Guess what? 
Phyllis| Really, Oh, theyre from Bob again. 
Pam| Thats great. 
Michael| Everybody takes the subway in New York. Its fast, its efficient, gets you there on time. Its a way to  Okay, theres a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. 
Michael| This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and its, thats Tina Fey . Thats Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, Im sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasnt. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
Dwight| Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present Ive ever gotten.
Angela| Really? I wouldnt know anything about that, but Im glad you enjoyed it.
Dwight| Oh I did. I did. 
Angela| I didnt get anything for Valentines Day.
Dwight| Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. 
Angela| Really? Well, I hope I do. 
Michael| I would love to live in New York someday. Its a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. Itd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, thats either the Hudson or the East, so were back,  should be back this way. Theres a lotta pressure on me right now. Its like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as its over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Lets do it. 
Jim|  Nah thats alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. Thats fine. No, I didnt even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye. 
Kevin| Woah, woah 
Delivery man| Phyllis Lapin. 
Pam| OH, Holy God!
Delivery man| Its from Bob.
Kevin| Man, that things bigger than I am. 
Delivery man| No, its not.
Kevin| Oh zip it. 
Michael| There they are. Whats up? Hey hey.
Craig| Hey.
Josh| Michael Scott.  
Michael| Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
Josh| You know Dan Gore from Buffalo. 
Michael| Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. 
Craig| Whats up buddy?
Michael| You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Craig| Guilty, yeah.
Michael| So whats going on? What I miss?
Josh| Not much, theyre uh, I guess running late upstairs, so were just waiting for the presentations.
Michael| Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... 
Dwight| Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately? 
Pam| You cant fire me, Dwight, just cause Michaels not here.
Dwight| No, Pam, Just. Just, 
Pam| You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Dwight|  Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didnt get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that shes not really the kind of person youd think would be into Valentines Day. Shes kind of... 
Pam| Tightly wound?
Dwight| (smirking) Exactly. 
Pam| Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. 
Dwight| You mean, like a ham? 
Pam| No, not like a ham. Its about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. 
Dwight| Ok, I get it.
Pam| That you remember her.
Dwight| Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. 
Josh| What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Craig| Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said "You gotta fire four people," and I was just like, "What?" Ya know?
Josh| Did you?
Craig| No, I just ignored her. Shes the worse.
Josh| She is our boss. 
Craig| She aint my boss dude. I dont work for that bitch.
Michael| Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, thats not. Cool it.
Craig| What? You like Jan? How can you 
like| Jan?
Michael| Maybe because shes my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. Shes... we hooked up and...
Josh| You hooked up with Jan? 
Michael| You know, months ago, just once, Its, just stupid. Just forget it, 
Josh| Yeah, lets change the subject. 
Michael| Yeah, yeah. 
Kelly| I dont know what hes thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Jim| Take it slow. Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... 
Ryan| Soda. 
Kelly|  Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Jim|  Oh, no, not while Im here.
Kelly| I mean, I know its Valentines Day, or whatever, but theres totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So... 
Ryan| I cant tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Kelly| OK, Thats cool. I completely understand.
Ryan| Cool. Cool. OK.
Jan| Josh Porter, Stamford. 
David| David 
Josh| Nice to meet you.
Jan| And Michael Scott, Scranton. 
David| Nice to meet you. 
Michael| Ditto.  How are you Jan?
Jan| Fine Michael. Thank you. 
David| OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the companys financial strengths. All Id like to do today is to... 
Jan| Nervous, no Im not nervous. Well, I guess Id be lying if I didnt say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, Im very nervous.
Josh| So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. 
David| Thanks very much. 
Josh| Thank you.
David| OK, Michael. 
Michael| What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. 
Michael|  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And thats the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, were not just in the paper business, were in the people business. Lets meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanleys dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business were hoping to build our bases on. 
Michael| Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably wont. You know, not what this is about.
Michael|  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What its like to walk a mile in Oscars shoes. Or try on Phyllis pants.  Maybe even one of Angelas famous brownies. And youll know, that youre home. 
Michael| Questions? 
David| Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
Michael| Yes, thank you.
David| But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branchs performance, so do you have that information as well? 
Michael| Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...  
Delivery man|  Can you sign?
Pam| Yeah.
Pam|  Oscar.
Angela| Nothing for me?
Pam|  Join the club.
Kevin| Whose it from? 
Oscar| My mom. 
Kelly| Its frustrating, because wed be so perfect together. 
Jim| You know what? Heres the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? Itd be great, but he isnt. 
Kelly| Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Jim| Well, hes not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Kelly| Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? 
Dan| And that about does it, thank you. 
Jan| OK.  Craig,
Craig| Yeah. Heres the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.
Jan| Um, Im sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Craig| I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal. 
David| So, does that mean you dont have the numbers on your branch? 
Craig| That is correct, yes.
Jan| Craig, you realize that were trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
Craig| Look, Im sorry, I didnt know.
Jan| Well, the point is, is that doesnt exactly bode well for your branch. 
Craig| Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesnt get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. 
Michael| Oh, ok. Alright.
Jan| NO, NO Im not, Im not, I just... I just dont know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, were all gonna get fired.
Michael| No youre not.
Jan| Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  cant believe that you told everybody and we didnt even sleep together.
Michael| Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Jan| Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, Its over. Do you understand?
Michael| Yes. Im sorry. I will fix this. Ill talk to him. Ill talk to David.
Jan| Surely, you cannot be serious? 
Michael| I am serious. And dont call me Shirley. Airplane. 
Dwight| Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Roy| Hey babe.
Pam| Hey. 
Roy| You almost ready to go?
Pam| I guess, yeah.
Roy| Whats wrong?
Pam| Nothing, its just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her. 
Roy| What, youre mad at me?
Pam| I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping youd get me 
something| for Valentines Day. 
Roy| Well, Valentines Day isnt over. Lets get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life. 
David| You understand this is a very serious situation.
Michael| No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, heres the deal. Its my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. 
David| You made a joke?
Michael| I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, hes not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. 
David| Well I dont need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss... 
Michael| I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, Im really sorry. It will never happen again. 
Jan| Uh, thats fine. Lets just forget it.
David| Good. 
Pam| Heading out?
Jim| Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentines Day. 
Pam| Bye. 
Phyllis| Goodnight Pam. 
Pam| Night Phyllis. 
Jan| Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Michael| Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again. 
Jan| Oh, no, its OK.  So, uh, Happy valentines Day.
Michael| Yeah, Happy Valentines Day. 
Jan| Oh.
Michael| Oy vey... schmear.
