Dwight| Go. Get the door.
Michael| Here we are.
Dwight| Go. Push!
Michael| Oh god.
Dwight| Push! 
Michael| No, no, turn it around.
Dwight| Really shove it.
Michael| Youll break it.
Dwight| Shove it through! Break it!
Michael| You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Dont break the branches, Dwight.
Michael| All right.
Dwight| I got a splinter.
Michael| Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
Dwight| Ive got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Michael| On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
Dwight| One, two, three. 
Michael| Merry Christmas!
Michael| Did it work?
Kevin|  Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Michael| A, thats what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Kevin| But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Michael| Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. Thats what Christmas is all about.
Jim| So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But Im also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I wont. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
Angela| Is there anything were missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Phyllis| Yes, I got those cute little ones.  Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Angela| Well see.
Ryan| Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Michael|   Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. Im kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
Angela| Fifty.
Michael| Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
Michael| It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 Gs. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
Michael| I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And Ill be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
Pam| You do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party.
Michael| Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
Kevin &amp; Oscar| One, two, three. 
Dwight| You guys should use a hand truck.
Kevin| Do we have one?
Dwight| No.
Angela|  Will you help me?
Michael| No! No way! It... no.
Darryl| Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Michael| You wanna be Santa?
Darryl| Yeah.
Michael| Have you ever seen Santa?
Darryl| Yeah, Ive seen Santa.
Michael| Okay.
Darryl| Who cares?
Michael| Well, Im sorry. It just doesnt work.
Dwight| Michael, I would like to be the elf.
Michael| That makes sense because he has elfish features.
Dwight|  Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
Toby| I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Oscar| I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I dont know anything about Creed. I know his names Creed. I know he works right over there. I think hes Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Kevin| I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didnt .
Michael| You get something good this year?
Jim| I think I did a pretty good job.
Michael| Yeah? Who did you have?
Jim| Well, I cant tell you cause its a secret. 
Michael| I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
Jim| Yeah?
Michael| I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Jim| Well, theres a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Michael| Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Jim| Thats great. Well dont tell me who it is, cause I can .. 
Michael| It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
Dwight| Gather round. Secret Santa, lets go. Lets go. Come on. Stanley, no, Im going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Stanley| I know how to plug something in.
Dwight| I want to do it.
Michael| All right, lets count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
All| Three, two, one. 
Michael| Not great.
Phyllis| Im sorry, everybody.
Pam| I think the tree looks nice.
Dwight| Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Michael| No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, lets do Secret Santa.
Michael| Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. Its like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
Dwight| First present, Oscar. 
Oscar|  Shower radio. Neat. 
Kelly| Oh, good, that was from me.
Oscar| Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. 
Dwight| Okay. Okay. Thats enough. Lets keep it moving on. Jim.
Jim| Oh, cool. 
Creed| Thats from me.
Jim| Great. Where did you get it?
Creed| I dont know. It was so long ago.
Jim| He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag.
Creed| Yep. Thats exactly what happened.
Dwight| Pam.
Pam|  Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. Its awesome.
Jim| Theres a little more to it.
Dwight| All right, next. Ryan. 
Michael| No, dont!
Ryan|  Whoa, a video iPod.
Michael| Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Ryan| Wasnt there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Michael| You dont know that.
Ryan| Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Michael| I did?
Ryan| Yeah.
Michael| What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesnt matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
Dwight| Michael.
Michael| Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
Phyllis| I knitted it for you.
Michael| An oven mitt? Okay. 
Michael| So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitts worth." I gave Ryan an iPod.
Kevin| Should we just keep opening up the presents?
Dwight| We dont do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Michael| I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Jim| What is Yankee Swap?
Michael| One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that persons gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose a new gift.
Jim| I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Pam| Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
Michael| Well, I call it fun!
Oscar| Why are we doing this?
Michael| Because its better. Because its more special.
Angela| It sounds mean.
Michael| Shut it. No, its not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Angela| Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. Hes not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. 
Michael| Okay, Meredith is up first. Heres the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Meredith| Ill take the teapot.
Jim| Oh, shouldnt we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Michael| Yankee Swap! Thats what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
Pam| Ill take the iPod.
Ryan| And I have to give it to her? I dont have a choice?
Dwight| Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Stanley|  That was meant for Kelly.
Ryan| Yeah, I figured.
Michael| I think this is going great.
Kelly|  Yikes.
Toby| Well, its for Angela, so .. 
Kelly| Thats like, the creepiest thing that Ive ever seen.
Dwight| Angela, youre up.
Angela| Ill take the poster. Some people like these.
Kelly| I will steal the iPod.
Michael| Everyone wants the iPod. Its a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
Michael| Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
Oscar| Ill take the ... teapot.
Meredith| Damn it.
Dwight| Okay, moving along. Meredith, lets go.
Meredith| I really want the iPod.
Dwight| Its already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Michael|  I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. Its beautiful.
Meredith| Ill take the oven mitt.
Michael| Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
Michael| Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I dont know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
Michael|  "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
Dwight| You and me, Michael. Yes!
Michael| Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Dwight| I never said it was better than an iPod.
Dwight| Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Dwight|  Take that, Saddam!
Michael| Last gift. Kevin.
Kevin| I want the foot bath.
Kevin| Thats the thing I bought myself. Im really psyched to use it.  Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Dwight| Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Pam| I want the iPod.
Kelly| Damn it.
Jim| Sure you dont want the teapot?
Pam| Well, I mean, its an iPod. But .. 
Jim| Right.
Pam| Sorry, I .. 
Jim| No. No. Definitely. Its .. 
Kelly| Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Dwight| Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Jim| Got to be kidding me.
Dwight| Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Michael|  What is she so upset about?
Pam| Maybe because you hated her present so much.
Michael| Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think its a success and Im the one who ended up with Dwights stupid paintball pellets.
Jim| Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Stanley| And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Michael| Well, I didnt. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
Oscar| You got a bonus check?
Pam| How much?
Michael| It wasnt. It wasnt that much. It was $3,000.
Stanley| All right, Im done now.
Michael| Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your partys so lame.
Liquor Store Clerk| It comes to $166.41.
Michael| All right, now, youre the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Liquor Store Clerk| Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.
Michael| Cool, cool. Box it up.
Jim| I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Dwight| No trades.
Jim| Come on, its a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
Dwight| "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. 
Jim| To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, its a little too much to handle.
Roy| This is awesome.
Pam| I know. Its totally going to change the way I work out.
Roy| Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I dont have to. Im gonna save a ton of money.
Pam| So what are you going to get me instead?
Roy| I dont know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
Michael| Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
Angela| What is that?
Michael| This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
Meredith| We can drink?
Toby| Were really not supposed to serve alcohol.
Michael| Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, its a party. Come on. If I cant throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Meredith| Me. Please.
Michael| Go, here we go!
Meredith| The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Years resolution that Im not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Phyllis| Hi guys.
Ryan| Hey.
Phyllis| Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Kevin| Kevin Malone.
Bob Vance| Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
Stanley| Stanley Hudson.
Bob Vance| Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
Ryan| Ryan Howard.
Bob Vance| Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
Ryan| What line of work you in, Bob?
Roy| I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
Darryl| Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else Im done.
Roy| Its possible. I cant believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Darryl| I had to. I needed defense.
Roy| Come on! Shaun Alexander? Hes the best back in the league.
Darryl| Its defense.
Roy| Oh, no. That is not worth it. 
Darryl| It is worth it.
Roy| Never.
Darryl| Are you kidding? You wait.
Michael| Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, hows it going in here? 
Ryan| Were running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Angela| There should be some .. 
Michael| No, no, no, no. Well find some, dont leave the party.
Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Kevin| One, two, three. 
Michael| Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Ryan| Oh, no.
Michael| Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ryan| I really did not do anything.
Michael| Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
Jim| You know, you dont have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
Pam|  No, I was just checking out my present. 
Jim| But .. 
Pam| I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. 
Jim| Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
Pam|  Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Pam| Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Pam| Oh, my God! Its incredible.  Is this the Boggle timer?
Jim| I didnt think you were going to get that one. I really didnt.
Dwight| This is so awesome.
Michael| Not bad. And if it couldnt go to Ryan, you are the guy Id want it to go to.
Dwight| Thank you.
Michael| Youre welcome.
Todd Packer|  Merry Christmas, asswipe!
Michael| No way. Oh, youre kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
Todd Packer|  Whats up my nerds. Check it out. 
Michael| Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Todd Packer| Pacman need a drinky.
Michael| Oh, lets fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Tobys gonna fix you up.
Kevin|  Yeahhh.
Michael| Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
Darryl| Thats okay, Mike.
Michael| No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
Darryl| All right. Thanks, man.
Michael| Hey, Merry Christmas.
Ryan|  Whose butt is that?
Kevin| Mine.
Ryan| Oh, how did I not guess that?
Michael|  Lampshade on head! Its happening!
Creed|  Oh, no.
Kelly| Hey.
Dwight| Oh, hello there.  But what are you doing?
Kelly| I dont know.
Dwight| You shouldnt do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Kevin| Thanks for the party, Michael.
Meredith| Yeah.
Bob Vance| Oh, hey. Listen up. Were going to Poor Richards. Whos in?
Oscar| Im in.
Dwight| Yes.
Oscar| Michael? Poor Richards?
Michael| Yeah, that sounds good.
Michael| Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. Whats better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. Its really the greatest day of all time.
Michael| Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richards? 
Meredith| Yep.
Michael| Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, lets head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Meredith| Yeah.
Michael| Okay!
