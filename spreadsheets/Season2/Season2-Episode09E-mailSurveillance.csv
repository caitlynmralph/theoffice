Michael| It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.   Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend youre not here.
Jim| Are we in danger?
Michael| Theres no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. 
Kevin| Michael, should I call the...  What?
Michael| The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
Michael| Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... 
Sadiq (IT guy)| That just means you have to enter your password.
Michael| Oh... 
Sadiq (IT guy)| Whats your password, Michael? 
Michael| Oh, umm... 
Sadiq (IT guy)| Oh, its 1-2-3.
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Mi-
Michael| AH! Guh-oood.
Dwight| Sorry.
Michael| Please dont do that.
Dwight| Ok, Im sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Michael| I cant tell you.
Dwight| You have to tell me.
Michael| I dont have to tell you anything.
Dwight| Look, Michael, I know you dont want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Michael| Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  Im in the best shape of my life.  Look at this.  Brrr!  Thats strong!
Dwight| Yeah, but that doesnt matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Michael| Im not going get a brain-
Dwight| Or get hit by a car-
Michael| Stop it.
Dwight| Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Michael| Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why dont you just go... away?
Michael| There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that Ill be reading their e-mails.  
Michael| So how do you search?
Sadiq (IT guy)| By keyword phrase.
Michael| Try "profits".  No! Try "Michael Scott".  "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  Oh my God, wow!    E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.    "Sorry I didnt write back sooner; I cant go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."  Well, Stanleys an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
Oscar| Hey, whats the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Michael| Oh, no, everybody; Oscars gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That Im a robot?   I will destroy everything in my path-
Oscar| Actually, its just-
Michael| Beep! Bop!
Oscar| Ok... 
Michael| Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.   Oil can. Oil can.
Oscar| Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying youre doing e-mail surveillance.
Michael| Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
Dwight| So its true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Michael| You know what the problem is?
Stanley| I think I do.
Michael| The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think its scary or bad, but I dont. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
Kevin| I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Dwight| Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
Angela| I know.
Dwight| Good. 
Pam|  Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
Jim| What?
Pam| I know!
Jim| Hmm... 
Pam| Do you think that theyre like-
Jim| No.
Pam| No, right, no, no.
Jim| 
Pam| Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
Pam| Its like squishing a spider under a book.  Its gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that its really dead.  Sooo...  If you guys see anything... ?
Pam| Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.  
Dwight| Nice.
Pam| One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Dwight| Does he have access to their medical records?
Pam| Ummmm... 
Dwight| I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyones psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Michael| Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jims tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... . No.
Pam| Hey, Angela-
Angela| Hi.
Pam| Hows it going?
Angela| Its ok.
Pam| Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jims party tonight?
Angela| No.  Are we supposed to?
Pam| No. I mean, I dont know, I dont think so.
Angela| Hmm...  Excuse me.
Pam| Oh.
Michael| Theres always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just natures rule.  Its intimidation mostly, its the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
Kevin| Thats pretty young.
Pam| Yeah.
Kevin|   Are you gonna eat with us?
Michael| Of course.  Hangin with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
Jim| Uh hum.
Michael| Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybodyd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
Pam| The professors would go to the parties?
Michael| Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
Jim| Its true. Im having a party.  Ive got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didnt invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And its nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldnt be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because Im pretty sure he thinks that Im making Dwight up.    He is very real.
Pam|  What?  Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
Dwight| Question on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
Jim| Oh, uh, no. Could-
Dwight| I was wondering-
Jim| Could, keep that down.
Dwight| Why?
Jim| Because not everybody knows about the party.
Dwight| Like who?  Who doesnt know?
Jim| Umm, Michael.
Dwight| Why just Michael?
Jim| Because its a surprise.
Dwight| Is it?
Jim| Uh hmm.
Dwight| Oh, thats perfect!
Jim| So, dont tell.
Dwight| I wont.
Jim| Ok.
Jim| So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Pam| Really? Thats great.
Jim| I know.
Pam| Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Jim|  Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roys gonna come, or...
Pam| Oh, no, he cant make it.
Jim| Oh, ok, cool.  
Michael| Hey there.
Jim| Hey.
Michael| Almost quittin time.
Jim| Yup, its, uh, four oclock.
Michael| One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I dont know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya dont, we could hang out.
Jim| Oh, um... .I cant.
Michael| You have plans.
Jim| Uh hmm, definitely.
Michael| I do, too. I do, too. 
Jim| You do?
Michael| I do, yeah. Big plans.
Jim| Because you said "do you wanna hang out"-
Michael| Tonight, I cant do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Jim| Really?
Michael| Yeah.
Jim| Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Michael| Its the best.  Its the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
Jim| Improv sounds great.
Michael| It is. Ok.
Jim| Alright.
Michael|  What?
Jim| I think Stanley just coughed. 
Michael| Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
Pam| No thanks.
Michael| Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Oscar| Im on a call.
Michael| Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
Kevin| My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Michael| Ok, alright.
Kevin| Oh.
Michael| Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin off to?
Angela| Im just leaving for the day.
Michael| Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
Angela| Charity.  Bake drive.
Michael| Liar!
Angela| No!
Michael| You are a liar.
Angela| No, Im not.
Michael| Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why dont we watch that show that youve been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
Dwight| Battlestar Galatica.
Michael| Thats, whatever stupid show you want-
Dwight| I cant-
Michael| To watch tonight
Dwight| Tonight.  
Michael| Were watching it.
Dwight| Unfortunately, Ive got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.  
Michael| I didnt know you played soccer, Dwight.
Dwight| Clarinet.
Michael| You, too, Dwight?
Dwight| Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that youre doing, and Ill see you Monday.   He has no idea!
Jim| Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybodys attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, its not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Dwight| Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock? 
Mark| Hey, you must be Dwight!
Dwight| You dont work with us.
Jim| Thats because Marks my roommate.
Mark| Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. 
Dwight| Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
Jim| Uh hmm.
Dwight| When is the guest of honor coming?
Jim| Oh, uh, later-ish.
Dwight| Hes gonna love it!
Jim| Great.   Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Pam| Definitely.
Jim| Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if were lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Ryan| Hey, is Katy coming?
Jim| Uh, actually, I havent talked to her in a while.
Ryan| Huh, is it ok if I call her?  
Jim| We can talk about that later.
Improv Teacher| Ok, lets get right into it.  I need two people for the first scene.
Michael|  Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
Improv Teacher| Ok, Michael.  And... anybody?  How about Mary-Beth?  Come on. Ok, so you start us off Mary-Beth.
Mary-Beth| Great.  La la la la la laaa... 
Michael|  Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  Im with the FBI.
Michael| Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun.   Thats why I always start with a gun, because you cant top it, you just cant.  
Girl acting Pregnant| Im supposed to meet my doctor here?  Have ya seen him?  Hes a very angry midget.

Bill| I promise its worthit .  Ooo, I can see you walking out of here and youre thrilled with your reading.
Michael| What are you... 
Improv Teacher| Michael, what did you tell him?
Michael| Nothing.
Improv Teacher| Then why are his hands up?  Bill?

Jim| Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin fun?
Angela| I got sap on me.
Jim| Chicken, hot dog, burger.
Angela| Im a vegetarian.
Jim| There is soda inside.
Angela| Guh.
Stanley| I didnt think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
Oscar| Yeah, it surprised us all.  Ill tell you why.  Because when they---
Kelly| Im sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  Theres gotta be something else we can talk about.
Angela| I think its alright. Jesus drank wine. 
Pam| Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.  
Phyllis| Sure.
Pam| Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Phyllis| You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and youre talking all the time.  Im sorry! 
Pam| Thats ok.  Its ok.
Kevin|   Not so fast... Fire Guy.
Mary-Beth| How do I get to Bernies Tavern from here?
Bill| Oh, dont worry.  Were all gonna carpool.
Michael| So Bernies, huh?  Were all going to Bernies?   Go to Bernies?
Bill| Oh sorry, were not going as a group, its just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing.
Michael| Right, right, right.  Well guys, Id love to go to Bernies with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Cant get out of it.
Bill| Ok. 
Michael| Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
Phyllis|  Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road Ive ever known... 
Jim| Oh by the way hows your side project going?
Pam| Oh, yeah I gave that up.
Jim| Really?
Pam| Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
Pam| Just because two people are hanging out, it doesnt mean that theyre together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Kevin|   Just turn around now, cause youre not welcome anymore.
Dwight| Surprise!   Everybody!
Phyllis| Dwight... 
Michael| Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  Im just driving by, thought Id drop in.   Theres some wine. I would love a glass, if youre gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!   Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, lets get this party started, ha! Ok?  Wheres that wine?
Michael| Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.    Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I cant explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin on.  Tender love is blind---
Michael and Jim|  It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation.  Divided, together, uh huh.  Making love with each other, uh huh.
Michael| Were making love!
Michael and Jim|  Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong?  Sail away with me... 
Michael| Talk! Just talk!
Mary-Beth| I am-
Michael| Shut up!
Michael| Funny story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey youre funny, youre the funniest guy Ive ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."   And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
