Michael| Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybodys favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here dont get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, whos gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin Donuts? Plus, bonus, its really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and hell tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbors house. Neighbors hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
Jim| So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
Pam| Ugh...
Pam| You know what they say about a car wreck, where its so awful you cant look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
Michael|  Hey hey hey! Its Fat Halpert.
Jim| What?
Michael|  Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.
Michael| So why dont I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why dont you show of your Dundies to the camera?
Jim| Oh, I cant because I keep them hidden. I dont want to look at them and get cocky. 
Michael| Oh, thats a good idea.
Dwight| Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
Michael| Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends. 
Michael| T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, its just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Dont go there" but thats... lame.
Michael| And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, arent you Stan? Why dont you, ah, show them some of your bling.
Stanley| I dont know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Michael| Oh, no you di-int.
Stanley| I think I did.
Michael| W-why did you...
Stanley| Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
Michael| Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
Michael|  To Oscar Martinez its the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
Pam| Michael has taped 
every| Dundies awards and now, hes making me look through hours of footage to find highlights.
Oscar|  Thats supposed to be confidential.
Michael|  He has the award-ah! ...its a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
Michael|  A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Michael| ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Pam| Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. Its great.
Michael|  ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
Kelly| It was you.
Phyllis| Live and learn.
Pam|  It wasnt. I swear.
Kelly| Yeah, it was.
Dwight| So, whats the joke? Youre not perfect either.
Pam| Were not laughing at you, Dwight.
Dwight| So who are we laughing at?
Pam| Um, just something somebody wrote.
Dwight| Who? Dave Barry?
Kelly|  No. No, just something that was written in the ladies room wall.
Dwight| What is it? Who wrote it?
Pam| Um, its kind of private.
Phyllis|  Its about Michael.
Dwight| That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, youll be punished less.
Pam| Okay, now Im laughing at you.
Michael|  Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
Jan|  Its a, its, its a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
Michael| Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
Jan| No.
Michael| Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
Jan| No, we dont approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... were not paying for this.
Michael| Um...
Michael|  Could you...?
Jan| Are you there Michael?
Michael| Yeah, Im here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
Michael| Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
Michael| ...come on, Jan!
Michael| Youre dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
Jan| Really? Im dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Michael| Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
Jan| You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Michael| No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Jan| And you had a luau....
Michael| ...it happens once every billion years.
Jan| And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Michael| Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
Jan| Okay, well, I dont understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesnt even make sense.
Michael| Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
Michael| This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carsons classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."  Heres the problem. Theres no open bar because of Jan and its the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. Itll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
Phyllis| Dwight, get out of here!!
Dwight| No, no, no, no...
Phyllis| What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Dwight| ...no, no, no, no, its not what you think.
Phyllis| Why were you peering over the stalls?!
Dwight| No, why were you in there?!
Phyllis| You are a pervert!
Dwight| What were you doing in there?
Phyllis| You, are, a pervert!
Dwight| I am not.
Michael|  The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley.
Michael| Pam, everybody! 
Michael| Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? Thats what I have to say. Ah, Roys accepting.
Roy|  Yes.
Michael|  Thank you Roy. Are there any words youd like to say, on Pams behalf?
Roy|  Ah, w-well see you next year.
Michael|  Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
Michael| Im not changing that, its the best one.
Jim| No, its hilarious, youre right. I just think, um, "worlds longest engagement", um, were all expecting it, you know?
Michael| Thats why its funny. Every year that Roy and Pam dont get married, it gets funnier.
Jim| Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Michael| Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.
Dwight| Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
Pam| Youre taking away our bathroom?
Dwight| We are going to have two mens rooms.
Phyllis| But where would we...go?
Dwight| Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to...
Pam| Michael...
Michael| Yes.
Pam| ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Michael| Okay, well, thats just ridiculous, so just dont, I-I dont have time for this right now.
Dwight| Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
Michael| Just dont, dont talk-
Dwight| ...for peoples behavior.
Michael| Dont talk-
Dwight| And its-
Michael| Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
Michael| Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Cant you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
Dwight|  Yes!
Michael| Yeah, not bad, right? So lets make this the best Dundies ever.
Dwight|  Best Dundies ever.
Dwight| Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Dwight| Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and Im not afraid to use it.  Devon!
Michael| "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. Im psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  Youre just a name and number and no one even says hello."  Card!
Oscar| The Dundies are kind of like a kids birthday party, and you go, and theres really nothing for you to do there. But the kids having a really good time, so youre, kind of there. Thats-thats kind of what its like.
Michael| "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
Dwight| The waitress tripped on the cord.
Michael| Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
Kevin|  Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Michael| Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, were going to be doing separate checks.
Stanley| You said, we could bring our families.
Michael| I did. And why didnt ya Stanley?
Stanley| I did, my wifes name is Terri.
Michael| Well, Im looking forward to meeting Terri.
Stanley| Its this person whos hand Im holding Michael.
Michael|  Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
Dwight| Really? We dont have any girls from HR.
Michael| No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
Dwight| Yeah?
Michael| And I was about to take her bra off...
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
Dwight| Like an AIDS test?
Michael| No!  God.
Michael|  Alright, so lets get this party staaaarrrrted.
Darryl| Hey lets go to Poor Richards.
Roy| Yeah, lets get out of here.
Pam| Um...
Michael| Um, guys, where you going? Pam, shows just getting started.

Phyllis| This says "Bushiest Beaver".
Michael| What? I told them busiest...idiots.

Michael| Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
Michael| Yeah.  "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go.
Ryan| What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I dont know what Im going to do. Thats the least of my...concerns right now.
Michael| And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybodys favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down.
Angela| No.
Jim|  I think those might be empty.
Pam| No, no. Cause the ice melts and then its like second drink! 
Jim| Second drink?
Michael| The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
Kelly| "Spicy Curry", whats that mean?
Michael| Um, not everything means something, its just a joke.
Kelly| Yeah, but whyd you give it to me? 
Michael| I dont know, its just...
Kelly| This is a bowler-
Michael| I know. Its ju- they didnt have any more businessmen. So...
Kelly| Yeah, but everyone else-
Michael| Just sit down Kelly.

This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Dont Go in There After Me" award. Its for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
Michael| There you go.
Pam| Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Jim|  Yeah, alright Kev.
Pam| Woo! Hey, I havent gotten one yet!
Jim| Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Pam| More Dundies!
Pam and Jim|  Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies!

Michael| You know you did.
Pam| Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech 
Stanley| Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I dont...
Stanley| So, I dont know what to think about this award. But at least I didnt get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. 
Michael| And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
Michael| ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Michael| It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
Michael| Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go.
Pam| I have so many people to thank for this award. 
Pam| Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldnt have done it without them.  Thank you. Lets give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
Pam| Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
Pam| And, I feel God in this Chilis tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Michael| Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
Jim| What a great year for the Dundies.
Jim| We got to see Ping.   And we learned of Michaels true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life. 
Jim| What?
Pam| Nothing.
Jim| Okay.
Pam| What?
Jim| I dont know, what?
Jim| Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Jim| Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Dwight| Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! Its okay, Im a sheriffs deputy.
Jim| Hes a volunteer.
Dwight| Dont get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Jim| Dwight come on, come-
Dwight| Its okay, Im going to use my shirt.
Pam| Dwight, get off me!
Employee| Im sorry, youre gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.
Dwight|  Ahh! I cant-
Michael| Was this years Dundies a success? Well, lets see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. 
Pam| Oh my God!
Jim| Whoa.
Pam| I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
Jim| Whoa.
Jim| Whoa, careful, careful.
Chilis Employee| We have a strict policy here not to over serve.  Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other peoples tables. I Xeroxed her drivers license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again. 
Michael| Great work tonight.
Dwight| Watch your step.
Michael| Excellent.
Dwight| Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasnt a concussion.
Michael| Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
Pam| I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Jim| No you dont.
Jim| Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Pam| Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
Jim| Shoot.
Pam| Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
Jim| Not really a question.  Okay, lets get you home, youre drunk.
Jim| Alright.
Pam| Bye.
Jim| Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
