Ryan| Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company. 
Michael| That is ridiculous.
Michael| Ryans about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. Im like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. 
Michael|  Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is? 
Ryan| Fozzie bear? 
Michael| Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
Michael| There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play. 
Ryan| Got it. 
Michael| And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch. 
Michael|   Hey! 
Dwight| Michael and I have a very special connection. Hes like Batman, Im like Robin. Hes like the Lone Ranger, and Im like Tonto. And its not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.

Michael| Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, Ive heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands. 
Michael| Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. 
Ryan| Yeah. 
Michael| Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? Thats rule number two. 
Dwight| Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michaels number one. Where is he? Where is he? 
Michael| So what was rule two? 
Ryan| Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.

Dwight| Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off. 
Michael| Okay, uh, well, one is taken. 
Ryan| Uh, okay, two?

Dwight| Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. 
Michael| Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. 
Dwight| Thats funny, too. But if were the Three Musketeers... 
Ryan| I dont want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I dont want to have a thing... here. You know, I dont want to be the "something guy". 
Jim| Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So were going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do? 
Stanley| Ooh. 
Jim| And, um... 
Pam| ...Would You Rather? 
Jim| Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game. 
Dwight|  Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, theres a... 
Jim| Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela. 
Angela| The Bible. 
Stanley| Thats one book. Youve got two others. 
Angela| A Purpose Driven Life. 
Jim| Nice. Third book? 
Angela| No. 
Jim| Okay. Phyllis. 
Phyllis| Um, The DaVinci Code. 
Angela| The DaVinci Code! 
Jim| Nice.
Angela| I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code. 
Dwight| Okay. Great, thats going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question is there fire wood on the island? 
Jim| I guess. 
Dwight| Then I would bring an axe, no books. 
Jim| Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight. 
Dwight| Fine. Physicians Desk Reference. 
Jim| Nice. Smart. 
Dwight| ...hollowed out, inside waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerers Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question did my shoes come off in the plane crash? 
Michael| Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or Im seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? 
Ryan| Yeah. 
Jim| Okay. Thought people read more books.  
Jim| DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith? 
Meredith| Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County... 
Jim| Wow. 
Pam| Legends of the Fall?
Jim| Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Pam| Well, I kind of liked Legal... 
Jim| Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies youre going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable. 
Pam| I take it back. 
Jim| Unforgivable. 
Pam| I take it back! 
Jim| Good.
Meredith| ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene... 
Dwight| Is this your car, Ryan? 
Michael| Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? 
Ryan|  Dont... 
Dwight| Good shocks. 
Michael| Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. M is for Murder, P is for... 
Ryan| Thats actually a test prep book. 
Michael| ...for Phone. What? 
Ryan| Thats a test prep for business school. 
Michael| Um, oh, thinking about business school? 
Ryan| I just got in. I applied, I go at night. 
Michael| Really? 
Ryan| Yeah. 
Michael| So you think you know a lot about business? 
Ryan| No, not yet. 
Michael| Uh huh. 
Ryan| Just started. 
Michael| Yeah. Quiz me. 
Ryan| I... wouldnt even know where to start. 
Michael| Come on, egghead. Lets do it. 
Dwight| Do it. 
Michael| Quiz me up. 
Ryan| All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? 
Michael| Uh...
Michael| When I was Ryans age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me. 
Ryan| Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? 
Dwight| Keep an existing... 
Michael|  Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, its equal. 
Ryan| It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer. 
Michael| Okay. Yes! It was a trick question. 
Dwight| Yeah, but look, I mean, he didnt need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. 
Michael| Okay, Dwight. 
Dwight| Self taught. You didnt even go to college. 
Michael| You know what, Dwight? You dont need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then youd know what youre talking about. 
Dwight|  Come on. Im studying with the master, huh?  
Michael| For instance, why dont you go to business...
Dwight|  You should learn from him, right? 
Ryan| I am.
Dwight| Right?
Ryan| I am.
Michael| Stop. Dwight. You know what? Youre acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! Hes not your five year old brother, Dwight. Hes a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. 
Dwight| Stupid! 
Michael| I did not go to business school. You know who else didnt go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so its not the same thing. At all. 
Michael| Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? 
Ryan| Its a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. 
Michael| You are so smart. You are so eff-in smart. You should be teaching me. 
Jim| Pam? Get us back into it.
Pam| Okay.
Jim| Five movies. Go ahead. 
Pam| Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...

Dwight| The Crow. 
Michael| I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? Im very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? 
Ryan| Maybe we should get some air. 
Michael| Nah, Im okay. 
Ryan| Im really uncomfortable.

Dwight| Yeah, its all him and Michael talk about anymore. 
Pam| You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends. 
Dwight| He doesnt even know that I do that. 
Pam| You should tell him. 
Dwight| Oh yeah, Pam. Right. Thats going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. 
Pam| Dwight.
Jim| What? 
Dwight| Im sorry I said that, I didnt... just part of me meant it. Besides, hed end up being a hero anyway.  
Jim| You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. 
Dwight| Oh Jim, Im not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. 
Jim| Yeah. Youre right. 
Dwight| Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time. 
Pam| Kay.

Roy| Youre all gay. 
Michael| Whos, uh... Whos next? Who we got? Whooo... 
Ryan|  Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.

Michael| Whats that?

Michael| Yeah.

Dwight|  Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they dont teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. 
Michael| Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they dont teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. 
Dwight| Thats exactly what I said. 
Michael| Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
