Dwight|  You should get one of these.
Jim| No.  Thank you.
Dwight| Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Jim| Done.
Dwight| This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry.
Jim| Sok.
Dwight| Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Jim| Youre not having sex.
Dwight| Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that.
Jim| Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Dwight| Its only twenty-five bucks.
Jim| Wow.  Um, ok. 
Michael| Pam, could I see you in my office?
Pam| Its performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I dont really know what to expect.
Michael| Pam, youre trustworthy-
Pam| Thank you.
Michael| And a woman-
Pam| Oh, no.
Michael| And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, its Jan. I guess I missed you.  Ill, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope its understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."  First impressions?
Pam| Uh, just off the top... I think shell be here this afternoon.
Michael| My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that well be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didnt want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didnt want it, we both didnt want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say somethings mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
Michael|  "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
Pam| She missed you.
Michael| But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".  That doesnt mean anything, those are just words.
Pam| I have one idea of what it means.
Michael| Ok. Yeah, what, what?
Pam| Well I dont think youre gonna be very happy with this.
Michael| Ohhh, great.  Well, now Im in a terrible mood.  Lets do your performance review-
Pam| Because shes conflicted.  She has to be professional, but shes fighting feelings... for you.
Michael| Ah, why, thats great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Pam| Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Michael| Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, lets listen to that again.  "Michael, its Jan.  I guess I missed you".
Dwight| Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Heres a little tip for your performance review.
Jim| Ok.
Dwight| Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
Jim| We dont have double-tabbed manila file folders.
Dwight| Oh, yes, we do.
Jim| No, we dont.
Dwight| Yeah, its a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and hell be sure to give you a raise.
Jim| Alright... well, Im not asking for a raise. Im gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Dwight| Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
Jim| I win.
Dwight| Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I dont have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please dont call me, and well see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Jim| Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Dwight| Uh, duh.
Jim| Duh.
Jim| Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that its Friday.  And thats what Ill be working on this afternoon.
Stanley| Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Michael| Really?
Stanley| Oh, yes.  Lets listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
Michael| God, Stanley, thats frickin brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Stanley| Oh, no, thats ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
Michael| No kidding.
Stanley| Its all about my bonus.
Pam| Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Jim| Ohh... 
Pam| Maybe more.
Jim| Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks its Friday.  So, keep that goin.
Pam| Oh, yea!
Michael| Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
Angela| I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. 
Pam| Michael?
Michael| Yeah?
Pam| Jans on the phone for you.
Michael| Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
Michael| Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasnt so mutual after all.  Yeah?
Jan| Michael.
Michael| Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
Jan| I am returning your many calls.
Michael| Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chilis.
Jan| No. No, we wont be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Michael| Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chilis.
Jan| Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
Michael| Oh.
Jan| I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Michael| Been thinking about you.
Jan| Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Michael| Um, I dont see how thats unprofessional. Just-
Jan| Michael.
Michael| Yep.
Jan| Are the cameras with you...
Michael| No.  
Jan| ...in your office?
Michael| They are not.  Yes, they are.   Thats my girlfriend.
Kevin| I heard they made out and had sex.
Oscar| No, they just made out.  Thats it.
Kevin| Well, I heard they made out 
and| had sex.
Angela| Dont talk about it.  Office romances are nobodys business but the people involved.
Kevin| Romances?
Michael| Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A "Michael-idea" folder?
Pam| Sorry.
Michael| Thats unfortunate.  How bout the suggestion box?  Theres tons of ideas in there.
Pam| What suggestion box?
Michael| The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe theres prizes?
Pam| Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
Michael| Why dont you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, Ill tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinsons coming, very soon, and so, were going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
Ryan| Dont you mean constructive criticism?
Michael| What did I say?
Kelly| You said "constructive complements"; that doesnt make any sense.  
Michael| Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. K?
Jim|  Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 1115, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a... 
Dwight| Saturday.
Jim|  ...Saturday, so just let me know what youre doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Jan|   Well address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye.   Could you please tell Michael that Im here?
Pam| Sure.
Michael| Hi, Jan.  How are you?
Jan| Im good; how are you?
Michael| Good to see you.
Jan| Nice to see you.
Michael| Ok.  Ok, why dont we just step into my office?  Were gonna go in here.
Jan| Can we please go in your office?
Michael| Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous.  No calls.
Kevin| Oooo.
Michael| Alright .
Jan| Thank you.
Michael| Its nice to see you.
Jan| Nice to see you too, Michael.
Michael| Really?
Jan| Not like that.
Michael| Oh, well.
Jan| You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  Im not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Michael| Alright.
Jan| Period.
Michael| Yep.
Jan| Do we understand each other.
Michael| Absolutely.
Michael| Im a little confused.  Cause first its all like kissy-kissy.  And then its like all regret.  Because "Oh, I regret that."  But, "Wait, Im still gonna call you."  But, but, "Were just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you dont do your job."  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.
Jan| So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Michael| No, no, no, I finished all of that.  Im very fast.  Im not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya maam.  But I do say thank ya maam.  But, Im, Im not like wham-bam.  Not that theres anything wrong with wham-bam.  If its consensual.    Were talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
Jan| No.
Michael| This is a business question. Its nothing personal, I promise.
Jan| Fine.
Michael| Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Jan| How is that a business question?
Michael| Well, youre wearing it at the office. And  it, Im sorry, but no offense, but its really sexy.
Jan| Please dont smell me, Michael.
Pam| Hey, Jim.
Jim| Hey, hows it goin?
Pam| Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night?
Jim| Course, its on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Pam| Can you believe who Trump fired?
Jim| No, that was unbelievable.
Dwight| Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Pam| You didnt see it?
Dwight| No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Michael| I dont understand-  Hold on.  Sorry.   Yes, Pam.
Pam| Michael, its time for the suggestion box meeting.
Michael| Im kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldnt interrupt.
Pam| You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Michael| I did not, not, not use those words.
Jan| Uh, Id like to sit in on that meeting  is it happening right now?
Michael| No, its in like ten minutes.
Pam| Everyones waiting in the conference room.
Jan| Great.  Very good.
Michael| Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of dont think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, lets, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"
Dwight| What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Kelly| I thought you read these every week.
Michael| Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
Dwight| It happens occasionally.
Michael| And, um, one down.  Next suggestion "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
Jan| That sounds serious, Michael.
Michael| Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
Dwight| Tom?
Michael| Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
Phyllis| Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?  Pow.
Michael| Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
Dwight| Next suggestion.
Michael| Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
Dwight| You need to do something about your B.O.
Michael| Ok, I dont know who this suggestion is meant for, but its more of a personal suggestion and its not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Toby| Arent the suggestions meant for you?
Michael| Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
Creed| Uh, Michael, he wasnt inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Michael| Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when were on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think its something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that weve learned this, lets continue.  See, this is good, were learning and were figuring some stuff out.  "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
Dwight| You need-
Michael| Ok.
Dwight| To do something about-
Michael| Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I dont think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
Angela| Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Michael| Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
Angela| Well, when you have coffee breath-
Michael| Ill work on that-
Angela| Its hard.
Michael| Lets keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebodys piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I dont wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Dwight| Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Michael| Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
Dwight| Next suggestion.
Michael| "Dont sl-", ok, thats blank  Dont, just put it-
Dwight| "Dont sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Jan| I cant, I cant-
Michael| I dont understand why youre so upset.
Jan| Please sit down.
Michael| Let me ask you-
Jan| Youre gonna sit here and Im gonna go sit over there.
Michael| Ok, let me ask you this.
Jan| Please, sit yourself down.
Michael| Let me ask you something.
Jan| What, Michael.  
Michael| Where did you get your outfit?
Dwight|  You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise!  Yes!  Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... Im awesome! I am awesome!
Michael| I just dont understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Jan| Because nothing did, Michael.  It, Im not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Michael| Look-
Dwight| Michael?
Michael| Oh my God... 
Dwight| Im sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
Jan| No, Dwight; come in.
Dwight| Great.
Michael| What do you want Dwight?
Dwight| I am ready for my performance review.
Michael| Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
Jan| Is this how youve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Michael| You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.  
Dwight| Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Michael| Why on earth would we give you a raise?
Dwight| That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word dedication.  I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
Michael| You do?  How do you get in?
Dwight| I have a copy of your key.
Jan| Thats a serious offense!
Michael| That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a mans heart.
Jan| Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
Dwight| Id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Michael| Ok, third wheel, why dont you do that?
Dwight| For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. 
Michael| That was deer!? Gross, oh!
Dwight| You liked it!
Michael| Oh, did not!
Dwight| Jan, have you ever had deer?
Jan| No.
Dwight| Its a delicacy.  And you know what?  Its an aphrodisiac.  So when were done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Michael| What do you say, Jan?
Jan| Ok! Heres what Im gonna do Im gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
Michael| Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
Jan|  Thank you, Dwight.
Jan| Look, I know its your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, Im not gonna discuss it with him, Im certainly not gonna discuss it with you.   Do you have a light?
Dwight| And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what Im capable of".  
Michael| Thats from Superman?
Dwight| Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Pam| Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
Jim| I dont really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Pam| How do you come back from that?
Jim| Um, you dont, I dont think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
Pam| No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
Jim| Oh-
Pam| As a human being.
Jim| Yeah, no, I dont think you can.
Jan| Im heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Michael| Wait.
Jan| K?
Michael| Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
Jan| Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Michael| Ok, so youre saying that there is a different time or place?
Jan| No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Michael| Well, ok, well never as in never ever ever, or never as in theres still a chance?
Jan| Never, for me, always means never ever ever.
Michael| I just want to know, from the horses mouth, what is the dealio?
Jan| Michael, it has nothing-
Michael| Am I too short?
Jan| With your looks, ok?  Its your personality.  I mean, youre obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I dont agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Michael| Really?
Jan| Really.  Youre, youre, youre a great guy, ok?
Michael| I appreciate that, thank you.
Jan| And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Michael| No, I wasnt, I didnt cry-
Jan| At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where Im looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
Michael| So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Jan| Ohhh, God.
Michael| Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesnt matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; Im good.  I can go home now.  
Michael| Hey, its 1220; where the hells Dwight?  
Jim| Ummm... no idea.
Michael| Never missed a day, my ass.
Pam|  Thank you.
Dwight|  Im here! Im here! Im here! Its ok!
