Dwight| Where is my desk?
Jim| That is weird.
Dwight| This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional. 
Jim| Ok, well, youre the one who lost the desk.
Dwight| I didnt lose my desk.
Jim| Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
Dwight| Okay, who moved my desk?
Jim| I think you should retrace your steps.
Dwight| Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Jim| Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute.
Jim|  Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Dwight| Jim, Ive given you this information, like, twenty times.
Jim| I know.
Dwight| Its by the ream?
Jim| Uh, yeah, ream.
Dwight| ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
Jim| Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
Dwight| Wash your hands, Kevin.
Jim|  Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second... 
Dwight|  Sensei, hello its Sempai... 
Jim| Umm... 
Dwight| Dwight... 
Jim| You know what, let me give you a call right back. Im going to uh, find it and then Ill call you back, thanks.
Dwight| Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Jim| Was that your mom?
Dwight| No, that was my Sensei.
Jim| Oh, I thought it was your mom.
Dwight| I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
Jim| Assistant to the Sensei, thats pretty cool.
Dwight| Assistant Sensei.
Jim| Ok.
Dwight| I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
Stanley| I dont want to stay until seven again this year.
Pam| I dont really have any control over that Stanley.
Pam| Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and thats today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Michael|  I dont want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
Ryan| Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Michael| Uhh, yes, I did, heres the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
Ryan| Why is that secret? 
Michael|  Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Pam| Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign. 
Michael| Yes, thank you. I know where to sign. 
Pam| Its just last year you... 
Michael| Last year they were out of order, werent they Pam?
Pam| Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Michael| Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. Thats pretty good. Um, actually, Im sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Ryan| Updating emergency contacts.
Pam|  Well, is that really a priority? 
Michael| Is it a priority? Oh I dont know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? Peoples legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I cant because we dont have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasnt a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. Thats the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
Ryan| Catch-22.
Michael| Catch-22. Yes. Why dont you give me your contact information to start with, ok, whats your cell?
Jim| Uh, Larissa Halpert. 
Ryan| Whats her address? 
Jim| 117 Mount Bergin St. 
Ryan| Hello?
Michael|  Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
Ryan| Do you mean Neverland?
Michael| This is Tito. 
Ryan| What?
Michael| Calling from... 
Pam|  Youre major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
Jim| You making this up as you go along, arent you?
Pam| I am just following the website.
Jim| Well, at least I dont have cavities.
Pam| Yes, you have very nice teeth.
Jim| Thanks.
Ryan| Who is your emergency contact? 
Kevin| Stacy.
Ryan| 
Michael|  Pick up.
Ryan| Hello?
Michael|  This is Mike Tyson.
Jim| Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Dwight| Impossible. The way theyre programmed... Youre mocking me.
Jim| No Im not.
Dwight| Look, Im going to offer you a little piece of advice. Im not afraid to make an example out of you.
Jim| Oh, thats not advice. What advice sounds like is this umm, dont ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. 
Dwight| Ok, give that back to me.
Jim| Ok, say please. 
Dwight| No. That is not a toy. 
Jim| Please?
Dwight| Please?
Jim| Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. 
Dwight| Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. 
Michael| And this is more a ying-yang thing. The Michael all cursive, the Scott all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man. 
Pam| Could you practice on the forms?
Dwight| No women or children, unless provoked. 
Jim| Ok, Roy? 
Dwight| Warehouse guy. Doesnt count. 
Jim| Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael? 
Michael| Yeah, yeah, I dont think that would happen.
Dwight| Because were friends.
Michael| Because I would kick his ass. 
Jim| Well, Dwights a purple belt, so... 
Michael| So? Ive beaten up black belts. 
Jim| Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Michael| They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, Im just lucky I got out. 
Ryan| Is your wife still your contact?
Toby| Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is Becker now. 
Ryan| Kay.
Toby| You dont need to write ex.
Michael| And after that, nobody ever messed with the Damn Rascals ever again. 
Jim| Sounds tough. When youre a Jet,  youre a Jet all the way, right? 
Michael| You were a Jet?
Angela| Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Michael| Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some ts and dot some is. Alright, Im going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. Thats my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. 
Dwight| Argggg!
Michael| Im friends with everybody in this office. Were all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that arent dentist appointments. And thats when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up. 
Michael| Just hit me. Youll see.
Jim| I cant. I just got a manicure.
Michael| Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. Thats a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Jim| Just have Dwight punch you. 
Michael| Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
Jim| You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Dwight| What belt are they?
Michael| Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented Armageddon... 
Dwight| No!
Michael| ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
Dwight| Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Years Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. 
Michael| Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Dwight| Ok, Ill punch you.
Michael| Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
Dwight| Kiyah!
Michael| Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
Dwight| Did I want to harm Michael? The one man Ive been hired to protect? No, I did not. 
Jim| Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Michael| Yeah.  Thank you. 
Dwight| I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. 
Jim| Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Pam| I dont know. 
Jim| Ok, Ill buy you a bag of chips. 
Pam| French Onion?
Jim| Obviously.
Pam| Ok.
Jim| Yes.
Dwight|  Take this pen and stab me with it. 
Michael|  Go away.
Pam| I just have a quick question.
Michael| I havent signed them, ok?
Pam| No, its not that. Um, I was just wondering, since Im probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Michael| Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight cant stop you from being mugged. Hes just not tough enough. 
Pam| Hes a purple belt. Thats really high.
Michael| Oh, I could beat up Dwight. Thats ridiculous. I could murder him. 
Pam| Its just out there, you... 
Michael| Oh, so thats what they are saying?
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| Ok, alright, where is Dwight? 
Jim| Uh, Kitchen.
Michael| Ok.
Kelly| Hi-yah!
Dwight| Good.
Kelly| Wow, thats actually pretty cool Dwight.
Dwight| Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Kelly| What?
Michael| Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
Dwight| I didnt sucker punch you, Michael. 
Michael| No, Really?
Dwight| In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Michael| Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. 
Dwight| Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Michael| Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.
Dwight| No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Michael| Really?
Dwight| Yeah.
Michael| You know what? Youre just lucky that we are at work right now.
Jim| Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwights dojo?
Michael| No, they must have class. 
Dwight| No, its free during the day. Its fine.
Michael| Look... 
Dwight| Ive got the key.
Toby| Michael... 
Michael| Hey, Toby.
Toby| Any word on those time cards?
Michael| Ive got an idea why dont you leave right now. Why dont you walk away from the room, kay? Fine. Well go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools. 
Jim| Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, Im coming, fight... 
Michael| I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. 
Ira| Uh, no, its not. 
Michael| I think it is. A guy told me about that.
Ira| Actually, its a symbol for eternal discipline.
Michael| Oh.
Jim|  Wow, that is really interesting. 
Pam| What? 
Jim| Your love line- Im just kidding. I cant see anything. 
Pam| Well, look closer. 
Jim|  Oh, ok. 
Pam| Once point for me.
Jim|  Tied up.
Pam| Oh, youre dead.
Jim| What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now. 
Pam| Hey, put me down. Put me down.  Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey... 
Ira| Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
Dwight| Yes, Sensei!
Michael| Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didnt have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner. 
Ira| Shi mate!
Dwight| Hiii! 
Michael| Hey!
Ira| Alright, break.
Michael| What the hell was that?
Dwight| Yes!
Ira| Dwight - awarded a point.
Michael| No. 
Dwight| Eat it!
Michael| Alright, thats the way you want it. 
Dwight| Two more.
Michael| Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. 
Kevin| Sweep the leg. 
Michael| Im comin atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
Dwight| No. 
Michael| I got his pants. 
Dwight| It was my pants.
Ira| No points for pants. 
Michael| Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! 
Ira| Clean single kick, gentlemen.
Michael| Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
Ira| Ok, break. Break.
Dwight| No holding.
Michael| You cant see. You cant see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points. 
Dwight| No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Michael| Open your mouth. 
Dwight| No, Michael! 
Michael| You talkin to me? You talkin to me? "Raging Bull." Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. Thisll be hilarious.  Oh, were playing phone tag. 
Ryans Voicemail| Seven new messages. First New Message.  "Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein." Next new message. "Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and Im mad!"
Michael| My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
Ryan| Fudge?
Michael|  Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? 
Dwight| I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Ryan| Ok, to what? 
Dwight| Just put "The Hospital." Contact number just put 9-1-1. 
Michael| He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man. 
Kevin| Later Jim. 
Jim| Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend.
Pam| Yeah, you too. 
Michael|  Yeah. 
Ryan| I have the emergency contacts. 
Michael| Yeah, just throw them on the chair. Ill take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? 
Ryan| Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably. 
Michael| If youre doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
Ryan| Yeah, alright, Ill um, see you Monday. 
Michael| Alright, bye. 
Michael| Dwight?
Angela| Michael, did you finish yet?
Michael| This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Dwight| Im busy. 
Michael| Well,  busier. Making the time.  
Stanley| Michael, cant your conversation wait till Monday.
Toby| We want to go home. 
Michael| Well, you dont even have anyone to go home to, Toby. 
Pam| The shipping place closes in a half hour. 
Michael| I know, but Ive been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, itd might help me out. What do you say? Lets gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. 
Angela| This is illegal.
Stanley| I dont care. 
Michael| I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? 
Dwight| Of course.
Michael| And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. 
Dwight| Michael, I dont know... 
Michael| I know, I know, I know, I wouldnt be offering it if I didnt think you could handle it.
Dwight| I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Michael| No, no, title change only. 
Dwight| Ill have Pam send out a memo.
Michael| No, no. Three month probationary period. Lets not tell anybody about this right now.
Dwight| Just a formality.
Michael| Absolutely but not really. 
Dwight| Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Michael| Yes you do. 
Dwight| Thank you, Sensei.
Michael| And, ditto.
Michael| I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
