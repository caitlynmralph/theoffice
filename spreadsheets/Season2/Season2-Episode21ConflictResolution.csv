Kevin| So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Pam| No.
Kevin| Cause Im in a band. We really rock.
Jim| Yeah, I mean its inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but Im fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Phyllis| Oh I got the Save The Date.
Pam| Yeah?
Phyllis| Yeah, pretty stationery.
Pam| Oh, thanks!
Angela| I didnt get mine yet.
Pam| Uh... 
Pam| There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  its my wedding. And I dont want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Michael| Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sams. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. Were doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Phyllis| Uh, on or off?
I.D. Photographer| Off.
Phyllis| Okay... 
Dwight| Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Phyllis|  Excuse me.
Dwight| Clown paint.
Dwight| I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Michael| Thats a nice tie.
Ryan| Thank you.
Michael| That is... who makes that?
Ryan| Um, I dont... 
Michael| Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Ryan| Um...  lets um, lets keep our clothes.
Oscar| Its like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, hed freak out! Hed freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... its... and Im supposed to work there. Im supposed... 
Michael|  Whats the dealio?
Toby| Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographers back there today.
Michael| Whats the problem?
Oscar| Angela!
Toby| Its just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Oscar| Since Christmas.
Michael| So what, youre having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Oscar| No.
Toby| Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Michael| Yes.
Toby| Heres how I usually handle this all I do is listen.
Michael| Yeah?
Toby| These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Michael| Okay.
Toby| Its like if you write someone a letter, when youre really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Michael| What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... 
Toby| Okay.
Michael| Okay... what?
Toby| That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Michael| Yeah, well... thats not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we dont get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
Michael|  A mediators tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Angela| Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Michael| No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Oscar| Whats the next one?
Michael| Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Angela| Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Michael| Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Michael|  Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
Angela| I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Michael| Come on, seriously, that?
Oscar| I dont like looking at it. Its creepy, and in bad taste, and its just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. Its kitsch. Its the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. Im talking about the... 
Michael| Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Pam| Win!
Michael| Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.  
Oscar| No.
Angela| Thats... no... 
Michael| Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Angela| How about, I leave it up?
Oscar| How bout, she takes it down?
Pam| How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Michael| Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Pam| Win.
Oscar| Fine.
Angela| But, it... 
Michael|  It is done!
Pam| Win
Photographer|   No, youre all good.
Creed| Great. 
Pam| Hey, Angela. I didnt have your zip code.
Angela| Oh. Thanks.
Angela| It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. Its not my taste.
Toby| You solved it?
Michael| Yes.
Toby| Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. 
Michael| Are those all the other complains?
Toby| Mmm-Hm.
Michael| I would like to see those please.
Toby| I... I cant do that.
Michael| You cant do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Toby| That... 
Michael| Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
Toby|  Its all Dwights.
Toby| Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that Im sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Michael| Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Photographer| Are you sure? 
Dwight| Oh, hes sure. Just shoot.
Photographer| 
Michael|  This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Pam| Nice.
Michael| You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Toby| Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year. 
Michael| How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Angela| You already did me.
Michael| Thats what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
Toby| Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Michael| Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Dwight| Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Pam|  Um... lets move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Michael|  All right, Pamela. Come on down! Lets do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Pam| Wait, what did it say?
Michael| Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldnt she do that at home?"  Who else? Why dont we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right? 
Pam| I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And Ive been really nice to her... and I havent told anyone. And what the hell?! 
Michael| Here is a Kelly complaint "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.
Ryan| My voicemails really spotty... sometimes... 
Kelly| I didnt file a complaint. I was just talking.
Toby| To your HR representative.
Kelly| To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Toby| Fine, Ill take your name off.  So no one will know.
Michael|  Makin progress.  Yes?
Jim| Dwight tried to kiss me.
Michael| What?!
Jim| And I didnt tell anyone because Im not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight| That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Jim| Well, Im not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Dwight|  Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Toby| Sure.
Michael| Stanley. 
Pam|  Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Michael|  You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Anglea| I didnt do it! 
Pam| I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Michael| Someone complained that the mens room is "whites only". Stanley, you know thats not true.
Stanley| I didnt say that.
Creed| Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? 
Michael| Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angelas giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Phyllis| No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Michael| And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Phyllis| Stanley and I are close, too.
Stanley| We sit close.
Michael| Oh... ok.
Toby|  Just take it. 
Pam| I cant believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Jim| Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe shes just trying to be friends.
Pam| Dont take her side.
Jim|  Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Pam| I dont know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Jim| You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| Yeah... 
Phyllis| I know you keep saying its your space, even though theres no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Angela| Yes, thats the problem.
Phyllis| I guess so... 
Michael| Okay, well... all settled, then.
Phyllis|  I dont like you.
Michael| OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Creed| I know exactly what hes talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Michael| All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Kevin| I accept your decision!
Jim| Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Dwight| That doesnt make any sense.
Jim| Well, it saves time, you know. Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Photographer|  Smile.
Dwight| No.
Dwight| I never smile if I can help it. Showing ones teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Jim| This came out really well.  There you go.
Dwight| This is humongous. I am not a security threat... 
Jim| Oh.
Dwight| And my middle name is Kurt, not Fart.
Jim| What did I write?
Dwight| I have another complaint for Jims permanent file.
Toby| Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Dwight| What box?!
Phyllis| But I didnt report your snoring-
Stanley| Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... 
Michael| Uh. Dwight.
Dwight| Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Michael| Okay! Calm down.
Dwight| No! You calm down! Whos side is Toby on? Whos side are you on?
Michael| Hey, hey!
Dwight| Him or me?
Michael| Stop.
Dwight| Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Michael| Okay... 
Dwight| Either he goes, or I go.
Michael| Dwight... 
Dwight| You choose!
Michael| Stop... 
Dwight| One of us is out of here by the end of today! 
Michael| Oh... kay... 
Dwight| I am not bluffing!
Michael| Okay.
Dwight| Okay?
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael| Mm-hmm.
Dwight| I deserve this. You know I do!
Michael|  You know your I.D. says youre a security threat?
Dwight| You have till five.
Dwight| Oh, look, Jim. Theres a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her youre interested? I could put in a good word for you, cause Ill still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Michael| Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Michael| Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didnt work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Michael| Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."  "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
Jim|  Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Michael|  "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."  "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the womans room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."  Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
Jim| That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took em all out.
Michael|  "Every time I typed my name, it said Diapers."
Jim| Just a simple macro. You know, these actually dont sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Michael| "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
Jim| Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And thats how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael| The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. Ive never had one. They sound awful.
Jim| Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Dwight| Its a good market. Higher volume.
Jim| Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Dwight| I have a girlfriend... 
Jim| Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Michael| Hey, theres like, 300 more of these. Lets get to them later.
Dwight| So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Michael| Maybe, I havent decided yet. Lets get to work.
Dwight| I want an answer by tomorrow.
Michael| Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrows not good. How about later in the week?
Dwight| Fine.
Michael| Good. Okay.
Michael| Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while youre here?
Photographer| I cant. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Michael| Well... thats... what, a computer camera, right?
Photographer| You mean digital?
Michael| Itll take like two seconds.
Photographer| 20 bucks.
Michael| Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.    
Stanley| You gotta be kiddin me.
Michael| Come on, everybody.
Dwight| Come on, lets go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Lets go.
Photographer| One, two, three... smile.  Try to smile.
Michael| We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Photographer| Alright, Im just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. 
Michael| Good, lets check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. Well take one more.
Photographer| Thatll be another 20.
Michael| What?
Pam| Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
Michael|  You just press the button.
Angela| What?
Jim| No, Pam.
Pam|  I am.  Its about the Save The Date.
Jim| Pam, it wasnt her.
Pam| What?!
Jim| Im the one who complained about you.
Jim| I... I didnt know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
Michael|  Okay, good. Check that out.
Jim| You know, it was one day.
Michael|  Thats terrible.
Jim| And I took it right back. It was like... 
Pam| Okay.
Phyllis| Oh, dear.
Michael|  Lets pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. 
Michael|  It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Michael|  One, two.. Didnt say three, did I?
Michael| But, Im sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You cant outrun your problems.
Jim|  Hey, Pam... its Jim. Um, I have a doctors appointment in the city. So I probably wont be in till the late afternoon. Just thought Id let you know. Okay, bye. 
Female worker| Okay, Jan will see you now.
Jim| Oh, thanks.
Michael| And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But heres the thing about cage matches sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
