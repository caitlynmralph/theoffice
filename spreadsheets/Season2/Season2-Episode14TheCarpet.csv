Ryan|  What?
Jim| Oh, nothing.
Jim| Pams on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so itll be nice to see her.  Itll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, thatll be nice.  And thats that. 
Ryan|  What?
Jim| Oh, nothing.
Ryan| Jims been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but its nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. 
Michael| Spamster!
Pam| Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
Michael| Hamster.
Pam| Right. 
Michael| Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
Pam| It was great. 
Michael| Yeah?
Pam| Mm-hm.
Michael| Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
Pam| Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January. 
Michael| I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay.  Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
Pam| What?
Michael| Wow!  What happened in there?  
Pam| I dont know.
Michael| There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
Pam|  Oh... I dont know.
Michael| Is it a bird?
Pam| No, I dont think its a bird.
Michael| Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
Kevin| Whats goin on?
Michael| Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. 
Kevin|  I dont think thats vomit.
Michael| Check it out.
Kevin| Me? 
Michael| Check it out.  Dont be a wuss, just get... no, Im not holding your coffee.  
Kevin| Oh, thats ridiculous.  
Michael| What is it?  
Kevin| Michael.  
Michael| What is it?  No, just tell me what it is. 
Kevin|  Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I cant hold my breath that long. 
Pam| Open the door up!
Kevin| It smelled 
terrible|.
Pam and others|   Phew.  Oh!  No, mm-mm. 
Michael| I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
Toby| Thats no burst pipe.
Michael| How do you know that?  What is it, then? 
Creed| Hi guys.  Somebody makin soup? 
Michael|  Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. 
Dwight|  Its still stinky.
Michael| That is worse. 
Dwight| She probably scrubbed it 
into| the fibers of the carpet.  Total permeation.  
Michael|   I am a big Fear Factor fan.  Im a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um...    I cant stand it , I cant stay in here another second.  No!
Jim| Hey!  Welcome back!
Pam| Thanks!
Jim| So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Pam| A little.
Jim| Good!  Whats goin on here? 
Jim| What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting. 
Ryan|  It wasnt me.  Um... it wasnt me.  It was not me. 
Jim|  Oh.  Wow.
Pam| 
Michael|   Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Jim| That might be a little difficult with the one computer. 
Michael| Oh... Its ...
Jim| But theres definitely a desk open in the back. 
Michael|  Yeah ... 
Jim| ...which I guess Ill be taking.
Michael| No, no, no!  Seriously, I dont mind sharing. 
Jim| No, no, no, seriously, Ill be in the back. 
Jim| Hey, Kelly.
Kelly| Are you moving back here? 
Jim| Um, just for the day while Michaels at my desk. 
Kelly| Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
Jim| Allergy to... the desk? 
Kelly|  Weird. 
Michael|  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
Dwight|  Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Michael| Dont ape me.
Dwight| Okay.
Michael| This is great.
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| The pressures of my office are insane.
Dwight|  Mm.
Michael| I just... you couldnt understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
Dwight| No way!
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| And who had your office? 
Michael| Ed Truck.   Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work."  What a jerk.  Hes... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. 
Kelly|  Im serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because arent all hangers like that big?  So I dont understand why the closet engineer didnt think of that.  So now Im doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
Michael| You know who used to sit at that desk? 
Dwight| That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Michael| Mm-mm.  Todd Packer. 
Dwight| No!  
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| I thought he was out on the road.
Michael| He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  Hed come in and sit there sometimes.
Dwight| Ah. 
Michael| When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office .  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that 
they| were crazy.  
Michael| I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. 
Stanley|  Excuse me one second, please.  What is it that you need right now that you cant wait until Im off the phone with a customer?
Michael| Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
Michael| Another time, Packer held this guys head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasnt hired. 
Creed|  What did you hit me for? 
Michael| Charley horse!
Creed| What?
Michael| Charley horse!
Creed| You shouldnt have hit me, Michael.
Michael| Oh, okay.  Gah.
Michael| Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.   It was hysterical. 
Kelly|  Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
Ryan| Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
Jim| Its the lever on the side.
Ryan| Thats what I told him.  Thanks. 
Kelly| Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?  
Jim| No, I dont think I can...
Kelly| Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  Hes so cute.  I like him 
so| much.  And I would do it, but Im too shy.  Please, Jim, please, please, please, please, Jim. Please, please, please...
Michael|  Dwight.
Dwight|  Michael.
Michael| Lets send up Accounting.
Dwight| What?
Michael| Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
Michael| Hey guys.  
Oscar| Hey, Michael.
Michael| Ahem.  Whats up? 
Oscar| Hey, Dwight. 
Michael and Dwight|  Ahhhh!  Whoo hoo!  Come on, come on, come on, come on!  Sales rules!
Dwight| Yeah! 
Michael| Yeah! Oh ho ho 
Dwight| Should we help em pick up their stuff?
Michael| No, no, no, no.  We dont do that.  We dont do that. 
Dwight| Okay.
Michael| Watch out, Pam. Youre next!
Pam| Youre gonna throw my things on the ground?
Michael| Maybe! 
Oscar| What happened in Michaels office was wrong.  I understand it , it makes sense   But it... it was still wrong.
Michael| Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I dont know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesnt do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her. 
Michael| You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
Dwight|  Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  Im totally gonna win us that box set.
Michael| Stop. 
Dwight| Jethro Tull... 
Michael| Stop it.  Stop.  It.   Dont.  Dont.  
Dwight|  I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Michael| All right.
Dwight|  Am I the 107th caller?
Pam|  ...back so soon.
Roy| We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.  
Pam| Yeah, right.
Roy| Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like Presidents Day or something.
Pam| Yeah, thats right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend. 
Kelly|  But its so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 930.  
Pam|  Are you kidding? 
Roy| No.
Michael| Hi, guys.
Angela| We havent finished getting things in order from your last visit.  
Michael| Im just walking around.
Angela| Were you?
Michael| Well, yeah.
Oscar| Its just that were really swamped over here, Michael.  
Michael| Oh, and Im not?  Why would you say that? Because Im having fun?  You guys just are workin for the weekend, arent you?  Im workin for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what were gonna do.  Im gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, Im gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?  
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael|  Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and Im going to ...  ... Im gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jims clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Lets see who winds up with the cash, shall we?  
Phyllis| Youre gonna compete against us?
Michael| Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
Dwight| It is so on!
Michael| God, this is gonna be fun.
Dwight| Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
Michael|  So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that!   Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  Thats my sale! 
Darryl|  What... Whats that?  Whatcha doing? 
Michael|  Nothing.
Roy|  I think hes dancing.
Michael| No.  Just ... 
Darryl| That was definitely not dancing.
Michael| You know what, guys?  Its none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
Darryl| Paper business.
Michael| Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?  
Roy| Nope.
Michael| Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. 
Pam| Somebody did something bad to Michaels carpet. Maybe thats all we need to know. 
Creed|  Who do you think did it?
Oscar| Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
Creed| Really?  I thought you. 
Michael| This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.  
Michael| You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  Were... were not... were not doin this today.  
Pam| That doesnt seem fair.  
Michael| You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and Ill explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.  
Dwight| But youre the one who picked today.
Michael| I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what Im talkin about.
Stanley| Thats not what a hate crime is.
Michael| Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, wed be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.  
Pam| Whats our punishment? 
Michael| Youre all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly.   No.  NO!  
Jim| Hey!  
Ryan| Whats up?
Jim| Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  Its actually little awkward.
Ryan| What?
Jim| What do you think of Kelly?
Ryan| I dont know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ...  Umm... Shes really cool.
Jim| Are you interested in her?
Ryan| Yeah, totally.
Jim| Really?  
Ryan| Did she say something? 
Jim| She said lots of things.  
Ryan| Do you know if shes looking for a long-term thing or if shed be cool just hangin out?
Jim| I have no idea.
Ryan| Can you find out? 
Jim| Yeah.  Sure.  
Kelly|  Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but dont tell him that, okay?  Just tell him Im, like, up for anything.  I mean, Im not a slut, but who knows? 
Michael| Do you remember Ed Truck?
Creed| Sure.  He hired me.  Hows he doing?
Michael| How would I know?
Creed| I thought you might.
Michael| My biggest fear is turning into him.
Creed| Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Michael|   I wasnt talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you? 
Michael|  Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin back.
Ed| Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Michael| Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really dont wanna be up there right now.  
Ed| So, whats the problem with my pension?
Michael| Oh, no, no, no.  Youre good.  It was clerical.  Youre good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Ed| Well, what was done?
Michael| I didnt get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
Ed| Yeah, somebody once did that in my office. 
Michael| Really?
Ed| Yeah.
Michael| Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Ed| You cant expect to be friends with everybody. 
Michael| Well... s-sure I can.
Ed| No.  Theyll always think of you as a boss first. 
Michael| Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Ed| Im not sure that ever happens.
Michael| Well, okay.  Different management styles.
Ed| Why cant your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?
Michael| Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I dont have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney."
Jim|  Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  Ill talk to you later. Bye.
Kelly| You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Jim| Yep.
Michael|  Yes.
Todd Packer| Hello, yes. Im looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
Michael| Who is this?  How did you get this number? 
Packer| Your mom, you gay nerd! 
Michael| Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin?  
Todd| Hey, did you get that package I left for you? 
Michael| Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
Packer| It was pretty big.
Michael| Really?
Packer| Yeah.
Michael| Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it? 
Packer| Left it in the middle of your office.
Michael| Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
Roy| You mean the thing? 
Packer| 
Michael| Are you kidding me?  Oh!
Packer| Special delivery!
Michael| That was Packer!  Oh, youre... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you. 
Packer| Sit on the throne, Michael. 
Michael| Oh.   Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
Michael| It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I dont expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  Its ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun.  We just have fun!  Oh, Im just so sorry that I threw the thing out. 
Jims voicemail| You have seven unheard messages.
Pam|  Hey, Jim.  Its Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michaels there and its horrible.  Anyway, Im bored.  Come back!
Pam|  Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I cant see Michaels head.  Its working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. 
Pam|   Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. 
Pam|  Ill transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what wouldve happened, so thank you. 
Pam|  Hey, whats that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.  
Pam|  Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and Im not messing this up, so Ill see you tomorrow. 
Pam|  Calling from my cell phone.  I dont know if you guys figured out who did that to Michaels carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
