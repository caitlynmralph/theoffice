Michael| Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... thats great!
Pam| Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
Michael| Ohh... OK.
Michael| I know why shes calling. Its the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow Im supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.
Sherri|  Jan Levinsons office.
Michael| Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
Sherri| Oh, shes in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.
Michael| Well, Im gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said its best to wait till the end of the day.
Sherri| I just need the name of who youre planning to let go.
Michael| I dont know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Sherri| I know she wanted the name.
Michael| Okay... Sherri?
Sherri| Yeah?
Michael| If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
Sherri| Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.
Michael| Thanks.
Sherri| Mm-Hmm.
Michael| Ill call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
Sherri| Hey, Im still here.
Michael| Okay! Im sorry.
Sherri| Yeah.
Michael| No?
Sherri| OK.
Michael| Bye.
Sherri| Hanging up now. 
Michael| I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. Its... these are peoples lives youre talking about.
Pam|  You wanted me?
Michael| Yes.
Pam|  Papier-mache?
Michael| Yes.
Pam| Hmm.
Michael| Yeeesh.
Pam| Mm-hmm.
Michael| Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing Ive ever had to do.
Pam| Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Michael| Because its very scary stuff.
Pam| I think its gonna put a damper on the party a little.
Michael| Youre worried about the party? Theres a mans life at stake here.
Pam| So its a man?
Michael| No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
Pam| I just answer the phone.
Michael| And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Pam| Youre costume is fantastic! 
Michael| I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. 
Pam| Oh no, dont, dont, dont, dont.  Aah!  Okay... 
Michael| Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
Dwight|  What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Jim| Im a three hole punch version of Jim. Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Phyllis| Thats great!
Jim| Oh, yeah.
Dwight| Yeah, well look...  What about me?
Phyllis| What are you? A monk?
Dwight| I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Phyllis| Ass.
Michael| Hey.
Oscar| Michael.
Michael| You guys excited about the party?
Angela| Yeah.
Michael| Its gonna be fun.
Kevin| Yeah.
Angela| Yes.
Michael|  Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
Oscar| What are you implying?
Michael| All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Angela| You know, I dont know. We put them all up last night.
Michael| Well, you know what? Go buy some more. Ill approve the overages. Sound good?
Angela| Yeah.
Michael| Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, Im  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. Im going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Angela| But we dont keep two sets of books.
Michael| Well, thats not what Im saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Michael| Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
Kelly|  Why is that?
Michael| "Bend It Like Beckham."
Kelly| Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Michael|  Yeah. That would be perfect.
Kelly| Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I dont really play soccer or anything. 
Michael| Well, I dont really have two heads. So... 
Dwight| Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! 
Pam| Okay, greatest strength.
Jim| Okay, okay... 
Pam| A dog-like obedience to authority
Jim| Nice.
Pam| But that doesnt sound good.
Jim| Okay, okay. Um, how bout, the ultimate team player? 
Jim| Dwight is... special. But, I dont believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craigs List. Were really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Pam| Hes a gun nut.
Jim| Um. He sticks to his guns.
Angela| Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department... 
Oscar| Yes?
Angela| ... that has three people... 
Oscar| Yeah?
Angela| ... doing the work that could be done by two.
Oscar| This is great.  Oh.
Kevin| Yeah. Oh.
Michael| Who do you think it should be?
Dwight| Jim. Definitely.
Michael| No, Jim brings in money.
Dwight| Phyllis.
Michael| Eh.
Dwight| Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Michael| Its not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.  
Dwight| One of the warehouse guys.
Michael|  What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
Dwight| Who is he saying?
Michael| Youre right, I didnt even think of him.
Dwight| No, Michael.
Michael| Yeah, thats actually a really good idea.
Dwight|  No, not me.
Michael| Yeah... I could.
Dwight|  Not Dwight.
Michael| Im not saying thats what he said.
Dwight| I know thats what he said.
Michael|  What?
Dwight| Tell him, not Dwight.
Michael| That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Dwight| Tell him to stop.
Michael| Are you kidding?
Dwight| Quiet, you.
Michael| I agree. Hed land on his feet.
Dwight| Make him be quiet.  
Angela| Those arent chips and dip.
Pam| No, I made brownies.
Angela| Uh!
Pam| ... What?
Angela| Im just trying to figure out why youre sabotaging things.
Pam| I made brownies.
Angela| And I made cookies. Same category.
Pam| Im guessing Angelas the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Pam|  Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Jim| Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? Im gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Dwight| Stanley, could you come with me, please.
Stanley| No.
Dwight| As Assistant Regional Manager... 
Stanley| To the.
Dwight| Look! Ive got some bad news. Youre fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  Im serious, Stanley. Its over.  Im sorry.
Stanley|  Youre fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Michael| So. How did it go with Stanley? How... howd he take it?
Dwight| He wouldnt listen to me
Michael| Ahh, come on.
Dwight| If you want to fire him, youre going to have to tell him yourself.
Michael| I dont wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. Im certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... 
Dwight|  Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. Im very flattered. Dont get me wrong. Im just not sure that its my official resume or if its something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, Im gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? 
Dwight| Would I ever leave this company? Look, Im all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what Im getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, Im going wherever they value loyalty the most. 
Oscar| Oh... hey.
Ryan| Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just... 
Oscar| Oh. 
Dwight|  So you got the fax? So why didnt you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when Im dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So youll let me know when youve made a decis... 
Pam| Jim is really talented. And he should be the one whos getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Pam|  Dont take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
Jim| Um... its in Maryland.
Pam| Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And its definitely a step up. And a challenge.
Jim|  Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. 
Pam| Jim... 
Dwight| This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Michael| Oh, God.
Dwight| I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Michael| Fantastic!
Dwight| And I turned it down.
Michael| What?! That wouldve solved all my problems.
Dwight| Out of loyalty to this company... 
Michael|  Oh, you idiot.
Dwight| ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Michael| If you left, I wouldnt have to fire anybody.
Dwight| But then you wouldnt have me here.
Michael| Big deal. Oh, it wouldve worked out so well. Can you get it back?
Dwight| Its in Maryland.
Michael| You can call. Can you call em?
Dwight| I cant. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Michael| Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
Jim| Honestly, I dont think Michael has the slightest clue of who hes gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, whats going to happen is its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Michael|  Can I speak to you a minute?
Jim| Um... yes. 
Jim| Michael, I really didnt mean to... 
Michael| Help. Me. 
Jim| Im sorry?
Michael| I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
Jim| Oh, you want me to be you?
Michael| Yes.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
Jim| Oh, are you firing Creed?
Michael| No, no, no. Thats just the first thing... came... in head.
Jim| We should switch seats in order to... 
Michael| Yes, thats a good idea.
Jim| Alright.  Excuse me. Im really sorry, but I have to let you go. And its purely budgetary. Its not personal... 
Michael| Aaaahh! Im gonna kill myself!
Jim| Wow.
Michael| Im going to kill myself, and its your fault!
Jim| Thats an overreaction.
Michael| Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And theyre saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
Jim| Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Michael| I... this is Creed.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| Im improvising, so just try to keep up. 
Jim| Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Michael| And Im very angry, and I want... 
Jim|  Michael Scott here.
Michael| Im gonna kill you. Im going to kill you for firing me.
Jim| Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth... 
Michael| Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
Pam| What happened?
Jim| It wasnt me.
Pam| Oh. That was like crazy. Cause I was... 
Jim| Yeah, I know.
Michael| Uh, hey... Creed?
Creed|  Huh?
Michael| Could I talk to you for a second?
Michael| You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that youd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
Creed| What are you telling me?
Michael| I... were gonna have to... You... you want something better.
Creed| No, I dont. I wanna stay right here.
Michael| No, you wanna leave.
Creed| No, I wanna stay here.
Michael| Why... why are you making this so hard?
Creed| Um, I think theres a misunderstanding, Michael.
Michael| I think youre right.
Creed| Can I go?
Michael| No, of course  you cant go. We havent even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think youre a great guy, and I like you, youre... youre, goodbye.
Creed| Lets fight it.
Michael| Hmm?
Creed| Lets call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Michael| What old days? What are you talking about?
Creed| Did you start the paperwork yet?
Michael| Its right here on the desk, yeah.
Creed| You dont have to do this, Michael.
Michael| I cant, I cant... 
Creed| Undo it!
Michael| I cant change anything. This is the way... 
Creed|  No, you have the power to undo it.
Michael| I dont... okay, just listen.
Creed| Michael, undo it!
Michael| Dont... 
Michael| Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
Michael| I have to fire someone today, okay?
Creed| Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. Hes terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Michael| Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, youre always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
Creed| No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. Youre they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew youd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. Youre a fine man.
Michael| Dont... 
Creed| Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No ones gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Michael| Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
Devon| Creeds an idiot, you know that.
Michael| Well, he... 
Devon| No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.
Michael| Well, maybe I did.
Devon| Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.
Michael| Huh. No! I cant, no. I cant go back. I would look like an idiot.
Devon| Thats why Im being fired?
Michael| No.
Devon| So you might not look like an idiot?
Michael| No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... 
Devon| This is unbelievable!
Michael| I just hope that you and I can remain friends. 
Michael| Devon, wait, please.
Devon| What!
Michael| Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chilis. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
Devon|  Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, Im going to be at Poor Richards. And the rest of you can go to hell!
Angela|  What about the Halloween party?
Pam| Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, Im sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
Jim|  Come on.
Jim| Thats just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that were friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if Im gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldnt blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because its double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Michael| I  love Halloween. You know, its just, its just fun. Every year, its just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jacksons boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
Children|  Trick or treat!
Michael| He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
Kid| Im a bumble bee.
Michael| You look great! And youre a princess?
Kid| A fairy princess.
Michael| A fairy princess. Youre very... .
Kid| Im a lion.
Michael| Youre a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, thats all yours. Thats all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
