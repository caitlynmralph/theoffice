Michael| Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know its illegal in Pennsylvania, but its for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. Its just... Its nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good.
Jim| Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Dwight| I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Pam| Its a nice tux.
Dwight| I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
Roy| So, whats the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? Thats lame.
Pam| Come on, itll be fun, and besides, Im a roulette expert.
Dwight| Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Jim| I can always kind of win at roulette.
Dwight| Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Jim| Yeah.
Dwight| How would you do that?
Jim| Mind control.
Dwight|  You cant be serious. Are you serious?
Jim| Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Dwight| I dont believe you. Continue.
Jim| It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Dwight|  Thats ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why dont you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Jim| Okay, Ill try.  
Dwight| Oh, my God.
Michael| I try not to think of it as lagging behind. Its more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Jan|  Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Michael| Top 80 percent!
Jan| Michael?
Michael| Yeah?
Jan| You know that Im very serious here.
Michael| Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Jan| What?
Michael| Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but were having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. 
Jan| I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael| I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Jan|  I think you can handle it. 
Michael| Oh, come on. Come on.
Jan| I think so, Michael...
Michael| You know, itd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan| Goodbye, Michael.
Michael| Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but weve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. 
Michael| Okay, everybody. Tonights event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Oscar| Again? We do that every year.
Michael| Well, they need our money. They dont have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Oscar| Itd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Michael| Well, Oscar, if you dont like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Jim| That doesnt exist anymore. 
Michael| Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Pam| No, they stopped making that show.
Michael| Well, then, they need our money more than ever. 
Angela| You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Creed| Theres a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. Ill probably give the money to them. 
Kevin| Something with animals. Or people.
Kelly| Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is 
Angela| We are giving money that has been gambled. Why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Michael| Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? Were gonna...
Toby| Actually, I didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its... You know, theres gambling and alcohol, and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Michael| Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesnt exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. 
Jim| I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. 
Michael| No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. 
Phyllis| Afghani.
Michael| What?
Phyllis| Afghani. 
Michael| Thats a dog. 
Pam| No, thats Afghan. 
Michael| Thats a shawl. 
Dwight| Wait, canine AIDS?
Michael| No. Humans with AIDS.
Creed| Who has AIDS?
Jim| Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Michael| Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. 
Michael| There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. Its one of my dreams. 
Jim| What are you doing?
Pam| Oh, nothing. 
Jim| "Till Death Do Us Rock."
Pam| Theyre wedding bands.
Jim| Oh. 
Pam| Roy was supposed to pick the band, but hes concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
Jim| Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you dont hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, theyre all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. 
Pam| Theres a KISS cover band in here. 
Jim| Lets do it. 
Pam| Im pretty happy these days. Im getting married soon and Im getting along with everybody at work. 
Jim| Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here. 
Michael| I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? 
Darryl| Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. 
Michael| Its Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. 
Darryl| Except my warehouse. 
Michael| Well, actually, its my warehouse. 
Dwight| Actually, its owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. 
Michael| Why are you here?
Dwight| When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. 
Michael| Not. I said, not that. 
Darryl| We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. 
Michael| Thats ironic.
Darryl| What?
Michael| That you are afraid. 
Darryl| Why? Cause Im from the hood?
Michael| Dinkin flicka. 
Darryl|  Dinkin flicka. 
Darryl| I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin flicka." You know, things us Negroes say. 
Michael| Give me some. 
Darryl| Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Jim|  Wow. I dont know how youre gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Pam| I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Jim| Yes.
Pam| Have three stages, yeah.
Jim| Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Pam| Oh.
Jim| Lets take a look. Nice.
Pam| Oh, wait. Thats Kevin. On the drums.
Jim| What?
Pam| On the drums! On the drums!
Jim| Oh, my God, thats Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, hes the drummer and the singer.
Kevin| We really dont do a lot of weddings. We actually dont play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pams wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Jim| Wow. Oh!
Pam| Oh, my...
Jim| Yeah, you havent seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. Im gonna call the label, were gonna...
Pam| No! No!
Jim| No, Pam, youre gonna lose him to another wedding.
Pam| No, come back! No, no, no!
Jim| Kev!
Pam| Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
Michael|  Yes
Pam|  Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Michael| Who?
Pam| Carol Stills.
Michael| Do I know a Carol Stills?
Pam| Your realtor.
Michael| Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it 
Pam| Sometimes I dont put Michael through until hes already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Pam| Carol, youre on with Michael.
Carol|  Hello, Michael?
Michael| Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Carol| Im great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael| Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Carol| Oh, great.
Michael| Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. Its okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. 
Carol| Oh, good, Im glad. Can I drop it over later?
Michael| Actually, Im sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Carol| Oh, great.
Michael| Yeah, itll be good. You know what? Why dont you come by? Bring the papers, Ill sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Carol| To the casino thing?
Michael| Yeah. Itll be fun. What do you... What do you...
Carol| What?
Michael| Oh, Im sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Pam| Michael, Jans on line two.
Michael| Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
Pam| Its still me. Uh, Jan, heres Michael.
Jan| Michael?
Michael| Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Jan| You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Michael| I am?
Jan| I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Michael| Oh, okay.
Jan| Incidentally, what is the charity?
Michael| AIDS.
Jan| Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Michael| Okay, sounds great.
Jan| Bye-bye.
Michael| Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Carol| No problemo.
Michael| Right.
Carol| To answer your question...
Michael| Yeah?
Carol| Yes.
Michael| What?
Carol| Id love to go.
Michael| Okay.
Carol| I have to get a sitter, but that shouldnt be a problem.
Michael| Problem. Good.
Carol| And Ill bring the papers, too.
Michael| Good, All right. Sounds great.
Carol| Ill see you tonight.
Michael| Bye.
Carol| Bye.
Michael| Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Pam|  Oh, my God!
Roy| Yeah! Thats great.
Michael| Hey, hey.
Carol| Hi.
Michael| Hey, Carol.
Carol| Hi.
Michael| You look great.
Carol| Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael| Oh, well... Kiss.  Thats how we do it in the paper biz. Its European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight 
Dwight| Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Dwight| Im Michaels wingman. Ive got his back. Two dates. Hes got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."
Michael| Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Carol| Drink would be good.
Michael| Okay.
Creed| Oh, I steal things all the time. Its just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies Ive taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Billys Girlfriend| Im gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Billy| No, Im fine. Thanks sweetheart.
Billys Girlfriend| Okay.
Michael| Billy, your nurse is hot.
Billy| Thats my girlfriend.
Michael| Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy| She was never my nurse. I met her at Chilis. She was my waitress.
Michael| Chilis is great.
Michael| Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Stanley|  Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Michael| Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Lets get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Dealer| Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Holdem. Good luck, everybody. Thats at least four red chips to you, sir.
Michael| All-in. 
Michael| Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because Im not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Toby| Ill call.
Michael| What are... Thats insane.
Toby| I have good cards.
Michael| Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesnt that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So dont be stupid. Just take it back.
Dealer| No, Im sorry. He cant, sir. Hes gone all-in.
Michael| Okay, all right, whatever.
Dealer| Flip them.
Michael| You really screwed that up. 
Meredith| Wow.
Toby| I dont really play cards, but Im not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Dwight| I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Jim|  I will raise.  Thanks.
Jim| Its the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Carol| Wow, bad luck.
Michael| Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck werent involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan| Michael?
Michael| Jan.
Jan| Hi.
Michael| Look, okay, I think were all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
Jan| What are you... Just... Wait, whatre you talking about?
Carol| What does that mean?
Michael| After you said you werent coming, I invited Carol to come and I dont think that I did anything wrong.
Jan| No. No, you didnt. Hi, Im Jan. Im Michaels boss.
Carol| Hi, hi.
Jan| Does anyone want a drink?
Carol| No, Im good. 
Jan| Okay. 
Michael| Um...
Dwight| Hey, hey.
Michael| Hey. What...
Dwight| Jans here. 
Dwight| Give me the dice.
Kevin| Come on, Dwight.
Dwight| Lets go.
Billy| Its all on you, baby. Lets go.
Angela| Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
Dwight| Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. 
Kevin| Yes.
Angela| Then roll an eight.
Dwight| Thank you, Angela.
Angela| Good luck, Dwight.
Dwight| Yeah! Yeah! 
Kevin| Dwight, lets keep it going. Lets keep it going. Lets go.
Oscar| Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Dwight| Give me the dice!
Jim| Yeah, right.
Pam| "Yeah, right," what?
Jim| What was this? 
Pam|  I have good cards.
Jim| Really?
Pam| Mhmm, And Im gonna take you all-in.
Jim| Wow. I think youre bluffing.
Kevin| Yeah, I think shes full of it.
Pam| Straight.
Jim| Oh. Three nines.
Kevin| Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Jim| Thank you very much. It was fun.
Jan| Cosmopolitan, please.
Carol| Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? Thats a long drive.
Jan| Well, its part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Carol| Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Jan| Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Carol| Well, Im having a nice time.
Jan| Oh, me too. Me too.
Ryan| One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Jim| So, thats still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Michael| All right!
Dealer| The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
Dwight| Come on, shooter!
Michael| Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!
Carol| All right.
Michael| Yeah!
Dealer| Five.
Michael| So close. So close.
Dwight| Come on.  So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan| What?
Dwight| Super 8?
Jan| No, I...
Dwight| Motel 6? Best Western?
Jan| I didnt... I dont know...
Dwight| Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Kevin| I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... Im pretty good at poker.
Kevin| All-in.
Phyllis| Okay, lets do it.
Bob Vance| Good Luck, honey.
Phyllis| Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesnt matter, its just fun to play.
Kevin| Three queens.
Dwight| Nice, very nice.
Phyllis| I have an ace.
Oscar| No, thats a flush.
Dwight| Oh, man!
Phyllis| Oh, I have a flush!
Bob| Yes!
Phyllis| Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Kevin| I suck.
Roy| She took you down, huh?
Kevin| I do not want to talk about it.
Roy| Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Kevin| Yeah?
Roy| Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Kevin| Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
Roy| Whatever. Im in charge of the music.
Kevin| Dude, you will not be sorry.
Roy| Sweet. All right.
Kevin| All right.
Jan| Smoke?
Jim| No, thanks. You having fun?
Jan| Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Jim| Yeah, we all really...
Jan| Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Jim| Well, I think you look great.
Jan| Why did I hook up with Michael?
Jim| Yeah, why did you?
Jan| It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Jim| Oh, yeah.
Jan| Good. Have you told anyone?
Jim| No.
Jan| Well, you should.
Bob| Excuse me. Big moment. The evenings chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!
Creed| Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Roy| Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Pam| Its okay. Ill see you at home.
Roy| Okay. Hey, dont try to lose too much money, all right?
Pam| Okay.
Roy| If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Jim| Okay, will do.
Roy| See you.
Pam| Bye! Hey.
Jim| Hey, hows it going?
Pam| Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Jim| Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Pam| About when you want to give me more of your money?
Jim| No, I...
Pam| Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. Im feeling kind of good tonight.
Jim| I was just... Im in love with you.
Pam| What?
Jim| Im really sorry if thats weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Pam| What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Jim| I just needed you to know. Once.
Pam| Well, I um... I... I cant.
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| You have no idea...
Jim| Dont do that.
Pam| ...what your friendship means to me.
Jim| Come on. I dont wanna do that. I wanna be 
Jan| Hey. Im leaving.
Michael| Hey, okay.
Jan| So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Michael| Thank you.
Jan| And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
Michael| Okay. Thanks for coming.
Jan| Nice to meet you.
Carol| You, too.
Jan| And you guys have a good time together.
Michael| Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Jan| Yeah.
Carol| Goodbye.
Michael| Good night. Shes a good boss.
Carol| She seems really nice.
Michael| Oh, shes great.
Michael| Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, Ive got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Pam|  About 10 minutes ago. No, I didnt know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I dont know, mom, hes my best friend.  Yeah, hes great.  Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim...
