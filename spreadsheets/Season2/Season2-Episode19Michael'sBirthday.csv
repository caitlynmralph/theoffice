Michael| So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
Oscar| Who is this guy again?
Michael| Dont worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. 
Ryan| Who uses calling cards anymore?
Michael| You know what? Thats a nice attitude, Ryan, Im just helping you invest in your future, my friend. 
Oscar| This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Michael| Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Toby| Didnt you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Michael| You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
Jim| No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? 
Michael| Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money were all going to make. Its not a pyramid scheme, it is a... its not even a scheme per se, its...  ... I have to go make a call. 
Pam| Happy birthday Michael.
Michael| Oh ho ho! What?
Pam| I said happy birthday.
Michael| Thank you! Thats really nice.
Michael| Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I dont know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a 
perfect| ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher.
Michael| Whats up?
Jim| Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Michael| Ah, thank you sir.
Meredith| Did you hear anything yet?
Kevin| No. Im still waiting.
Michael|  Yeah.
Dwight| Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Michael| Ohh, god.
Dwight| Birthday hug!
Michael| No no no, no, new suit, please. 
Dwight| That suit is amazing.
Michael| Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Dwight| Mmm. Maybe I should get one. 
Michael| Good luck. One of a kind. 
Dwight| Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Michael| Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  Theyve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Dwight| Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Michael| Dont! Nope! Please, dont want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Dwight| Lets get the party started. 
Michael| Lets get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! 
Phyllis| When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Pam| Ones good.
Angela| One thirty.  Im sorry, are we boring you?
Dwight| Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Phyllis| Where do we get those?
Dwight| Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. 
Pam| Michael wants a strippergram? 
Dwight| Yes, but he doesnt want to know when, or whom.
Angela| No. This is a closed door meeting. 
Michael|  Yeah?
Pam| Michael, I have Jan on the line. 
Michael| Oh, great, put her through. 
Jan| Hello, Michael.
Michael| Hey, you.
Jan| Im... returning your call, you said it was urgent. 
Michael| It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Jan| Well, todays not my birthday, so...
Michael| Really? Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Jan| ...Happy birthday, Michael.
Michael| Thanks. 
Jan| Am I on camera?
Michael| Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. 
Michael|  ...You can take a five, if you want. 
Michael| Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Stanley| Mmhmm, happy birthday.
Michael| Thanks. 
Jim| Man, Im so sorry. When do you find out?
Kevin| They said this afternoon. Theyre waiting on a second opinion.
Jim| Oh, okay.
Kelly| Second opinion on what?
Kevin| Um, I might have skin cancer.
Kelly| Oh, no! I was watching Greys Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and 
he| had skin cancer too.
Jim| Kelly, you know what...
Kelly| I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sisters.
Toby| Who brought in donuts?
Michael| Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Toby| Happy birthday!
Michael| You didnt know it was my birthday.
Toby| I... guess I forgot.
Michael| Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
Toby| Are you serious?
Michael| Mmm.
Oscar| Skin cancer is treatable.
Kevin| Right.
Oscar| Its going to be okay.
Angela| You dont know its going to be okay. Dont give him false hope. ...Its probably nothing, though.
Delivery Woman| Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.
Michael| Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright? 
Delivery Woman| Uh... s-sure. 
Michael|  Okay. Im so nervous.
Pam| I can sign for it.
Delivery Woman| Oh. Thanks.
Michael| When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
Michael|  Stop it. Stop! What is that? 
Dwight| Its For the Longest Time, by William Joel. Its you favorite song.
Michael| Yeah, well, its on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
Dwight| I probably care more than she does.
Michael| Youre making it worse. I bet Luke Perrys friends dont treat him like this .
Pam| When does he hear?
Jim| Sometime today.
Pam| Ohh... poor Kevin. 
Pam| If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Dwight| Uh, thats a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here! 
Michael| What?
Dwight| Listen up everyone! It is 1123 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mothers vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Michael|  Ohhh, God.
Dwight| There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Michael| Ohhh, no. 
Dwight| So come help me celebrate Michaels birth moment. Kevin! 
Oscar| ...Ill do it.
Michael| Ohh, no, no, no! I cant... Ryan, come on. Lets do this.
Dwight| Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Pam| ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Jim| Maybe, but... were gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Dwight| On three, were going to hoist away! Ready? 
Michael| Okay.
Dwight| Happy birth moment, Michael.
Michael| Thank you.
Dwight| One. Two. Three! 
Michael| Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. 
Dwight| Oscar...
Oscar| It wasnt me. 
Dwight| Okay, that is 
not| an eight foot sub.
Delivery Boy| Uh, we dont make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs. 
Dwight| F. Alright, whats the damage?
Delivery Boy| Uh, thirty-nine sixty.
Dwight|  Thirty nine... sixty.
Dwight| Why tip someone for a job Im capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. 
Dwight| Here they come.
Michael| Get in here... everybody. 
Dwight| Come and get it!
Michael| Birthday party subs! My gift to you. 
Oscar| What is this?
Dwight| Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Michael| The best.
Stanley| These are all the same?
Michael| Yes.
Angela| Bologna? I dont eat bologna. 
Michael| Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Angela| No.
Michael| Just the bread, its fresh baked.
Angela| No. 
Michael| Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
Michael| When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasnt even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... 
That| was the worst birthday I think I ever had. 
Jim| So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&Ms, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he wont get that back. 
Pam| Sixty-nine cup of noodles. 
Jim| Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Pam| And his favorite lunch.
Dwight| Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left . 
Ryan|  Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Dwight| Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. 
Angela|  Oh. Thank you. 
Dwight| Oh. I got it.
Angela| What are--- its... the party planning committee.
Dwight|  This is the most important day of the year. I cant risk anything.
Angela| Fine.
Dwight| What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Angela| Yes...  but dont expect any cookie.
Dwight|  But what if im hungry?
Angela|  
No cookie.| 
Jim|  ...What?
Pam| You use fabric softener?
Jim| Yeah, you dont?
Pam| No, I do.
Jim| ...Okay.
Office Staff|  Happy birthday dear Michael,  Happy birthday...  ...tooo youuuu.
Kevin| Hello? Hey.
Michael| Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Kevin| No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye.  It was just Stacy.
Michael| Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Dwight| Here we go. Make a wish.
Michael| Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... 
Dwight| Yaoo yay! 
Michael| ... I asked for trick candles.
Dwight| Pam was supposed to get em.
Michael| Okay. Well, when she comes back well do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Havent had a hug all day. 
Angela| No one cares about your birthday. Kevins waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Michael| ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, thats good timing. Thats... thats, sorry, thats terrible. Terrible news. Thats terrible... terrible news for both of us .
Pam|  We should probably head back.
Jim| Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Pam| You dare me? How old are you?
Jim| Just... quit stalling.
Pam|  Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. 
Jim| Such a dork. 
Pam|  Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Store Employee| Maam? Please dont touch that. That is not a toy.
Pam| Oh Im sorry. Im sorry. 
Jim| How old are you?
Pam| I hate you. 
Toby|  Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancees plan? Our health plan is s... just... its terrible.
Michael| There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Kevin| Still scary.
Michael| Yeah, but its not brain cancer. And it shouldnt stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Kevin| Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Michael| And laughter... also.
Toby| I dont really think people are in the laughing mood.
Michael| Why are you here? I didnt even invite you to my birthday party.
Toby| I work here. 
Michael|  Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesnt speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Kevin| If I go home now, Ill just drive myself crazy.
Michael| Well, youre pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Dwight| Where have you been? And dont say the bathroom, cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Jim| Well thats an invasion of privacy, so, Im going to tell Michael.
Dwight| Please, dont.
Jim| You... owe me.
Michael| Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, were going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. 
Stanley| Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday? 
Michael| How dare you sir. You are gross. 
Michael|  That should not be there.
Dwight| Ill get someone to take it down.
Michael| No, its alright. Its already up. Just leave it. Wheres Kevin? Come on! Lets get our skate on!
Kelly| Dont be scared! Youre good! Youre good!
Ryan| Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Jim| Think you can let go?
Pam| No. 
Jim| Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. 
Dwight| YEAH!
Pam| Who is that?
Jim| Is that Michael?
Michael| Yeah, Ive been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, youre on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Pam| I got it.
Michael| Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, its pretty scary. And Im thinking that uh, next time youre in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Jim| ...Its something to think about.
Kevin| I cant relax about it, you know?
Michael| Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Kevin| No, not yet.
Michael| Okay. Well. Live strong.
Kevin| Okay, Michael.
Michael| Alright.
Carol| Michael?
Michael| Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Carol| Uhh, no, I... dont just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
Michael| Oh, these... all your kids? 
Carol| No just the front two.
Michael| Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? 
Carol| Sure.
Michael| Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin now!
Michael| Push. Good! Thats great. You got it.  Excuse me.
Kevin| Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks.  It was negative.
Michael| Oh... God...  God!  Were gonna beat this, okay? Were gonna... come here .
Michael| Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Kevin| This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Michael| Okay, whos this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Dwight| Turn it around. Turn it around.
Michael| Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Dwight| Number one!!
Michael| Thank you... Dwight. Thats great. Thanks.
Pam| Michael? 
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| This is from all of us. 
Michael| Oh! You didnt need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it. 
Pam| Michaels birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I dont know... It was a good day.
