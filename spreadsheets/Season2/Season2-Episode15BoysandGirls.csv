Jan| So, Im happy to be here.  Its very nice to see all of you. Youre all looking well.
Pam| Todays a women in the workplace thing. Jans coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I dont really know what. But Michaels not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Jan| Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So... 
Michael|  Hey, whats going on?
Jan| Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldnt be here.
Michael| Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
Jan| What are you doing?
Michael| Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that todays woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads... 
Jan| Michael.
Michael| No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
Jan| Michael.
Michael| They did this up in Albany... 
Jan| You are not allowed in this session.
Michael| And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... 
Jan| Now youre really not allowed in this session.
Michael| Well, Im their boss, so I feel like... 
Jan| Im your boss.
Michael|  Anybody want any coffee or...
Jan| Were fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Michael| Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. Women of the workplace. About what? I dont know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
Jan| Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
Pam| Jan.
Jan| Yes, Pam?
Pam| Michaels still at the door.
Jan| Michael!
Jan|  So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. Theyre called... anyone?
Dwight| Its a terrible idea.
Jim| What is?
Dwight| Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long theyre going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Michael| Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. Youre a guy... too... sort of. Lets do this!
Michael|  Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Lets just clap.
Michael| Lets just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| Thats what Im talking about!
Jan| I dont know what youre doing here, Michael,
Michael| Just having a little guys in the workplace thing.
Jan| ... but its very destructive.
Michael| Why cant boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Jan| Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Michael| We have nowhere else Jan. This... 
Dwight| We could do it in the warehouse.
Jan| Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
Michael| OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? Theres another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, theres another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real mans work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
Michael| Oh, I think its going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I havent been there in months.
Dwight| Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Jan| Im so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
Pam| Mmmhmm.
Jan| Please? Thank you. very much.
Michael| So lets meet the warehouse! Lets get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
Darryl| My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Michael| You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. Theres Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, shes our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Roy| Why?
Michael| Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy... 
Roy| I dont understand.
Michael| Roy and Pam. Its a Ram. Its a Ram thing.
Kevin|  I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet hell try to beat you up.
Jim| Thanks for the heads up, Kev.
Kevin| Ive got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Michael|  Uhhuhhuh. Just in case theres someone down here who shouldnt be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I dont see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
Jan| Why dont we go around the table and all say something that we know were good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Meredith| Hi. Im Meredith and Im an alch... good at supplier relations.
Jan| Great. Phyllis?
Phyllis| Im good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Angela|  Really?
Phyllis| I dont know. I thought that I wasnt going to be asked that... 
Jan| No. Okay. Stop. Go on... 
Angela| Ive seen some of your spreadsheets.
Phyllis| Really? I thought they were pretty... 
Pam| I dont know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is... 
Roy| Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard theres a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
Jim| Oh, no, no. No.
Roy| No, its cool, because I know youre a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. Were cool, right?
Jim| Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Roy| You know, its great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. Shes not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
Jim| Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Roy| So, were cool, right?
Jim| Yes. Yeah.
Roy| All right.
Jim| Yep. Cool, man.
Roy| Sweet.
Kevin| 
Darryl| Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Michael| Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I dont think... You.. Youre... My job sucks compared to this. I dont think youd like it up there.
Darryl| The experience... 
Michael| Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
Dwight| Okay. Lets go. Step up.
Michael| Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
Meredith| In five years, Id like to be... five years sober.
Jan| That is an excellent goal.
Meredith| Four and a half.
Kelly| Ill tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Jan| Great! Uh-huh?
Kelly| I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Women| 
Jan| Well, Ill be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if theres any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Dwight| Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
Jim| Ponies.
Dwight| No.
Ryan| How about rainbows?
Dwight| No.
Jim| Flowers.
Darryl| Its dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Michael| Hey, youre going to, going to hurt yourself.
Darryl| Mike.
Michael| Stand clear.
Darryl| Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Michael| Im fine, Im fine. Im fine.
Darryl| Look, would ya... look.
Michael| Oh, oh, oh!  Well get somebody to clean that up.
Darryl| Were the ones that got to clean that up!
Lonny| Dammit, Michael!
Michael| We ought to have this thing serviced.
Michael| So! Guys gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. Thats going to happen, you know. Were guys, so... 
Madge| Hey, do you want me to go?
Michael| No, why? Why would I... ? You could... 
Madge| Ill go.
Michael| Stay or... 
Phyllis| ...and a big walk-in closet.
Meredith| Oh, thats part of my dream too.
Kelly| Oh, me too.
Jan| Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
Pam| Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and Id still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
Phyllis| Shes real good.
Pam| Thanks.
Jan| You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Pam| Well... I have a job right now, so I cant really take time off... 
Jan| Well, its only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but Im sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Pam| Well... its just that the weekends arent good because, um...
Jan| There are always a million reasons not to do something.
Michael| Lets start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
Darryl| My priority is safety.
Michael| OK.
Darryl| So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Michael| OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
Darryl| Uh uh uh. Dont shush me.
Michael| I... That was just... 
Darryl| That bothers me too.
Michael| I was breathing.
Roy| Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
Michael| I hate shushing. You know, thats the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
Lonny| You know thats a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?
Michael| OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. Thats what guys do... and we love it.
Jan| All right. Lets talk about clothing.
Phyllis| Im excited about today.  I love girl talk.
Jan| Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Angela| Im not gaining anything from this seminar. Im a professional woman. The head of accounting. Im in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think its insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
Roy| I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like "When are we going to go on a date-date?"
Guy| I hate that too! 
Darryl| I hate that too.
Kevin| That sucks so much.
Guy| It totally sucks.
Dwight| Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas aint free!"
Lonny| Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? Were not millionaires.
Michael| I feel you.
Darryl| No, you dont. You dont feel us. How can you? You know what?
Dwight| Not literally.
Darryl| You say were the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Michael| Yes.
Darryl| We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
Michael| Ah, you do. So... 
Darryl| But we get paid a lot less.
Dwight| Word.
Roy| Like next to no benefits.
Michael| I know. God! What is that?
Roy| Exactly.
Michael| It blows. It blows, man. Gah... 
Darryl| You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Roy| Thats what Im talking about.
Michael| No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
Roy| Absolutely.
Darryl| Thats what we need.
Guy| You know youre right.
Darryl| Man, see... Thats what Ive been sayin, man. We need to do this finally.
Michael| You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
Darryl| Its more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworkers Union?
Roy| In my truck.
Michael| Dockworkers?
Darryl| Man, hook you up.
Men| 
Guy| Come on, man.
Michael| Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
Darryl| Union! Union, yeah.
Michael| The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Darryl| Are you with us Mike?
Michael| Yeah-es.
Darryl| Welcome to the warehouse.
Group chant| Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi... 
Jan| Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. Im sure that all of you have felt that before... 
Michael|  This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points... 
Jan| What? A union! What... 
Michael| Dont get hysterical.
Jan| Im not... 
Michael| Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
Michael| Lets... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
Jan| The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Michael| Dont talk to me that way please. Just... theyre going to want to hear this from you.
Jan| You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
Michael| But were bonding down there!
Jan| Thats too bad.
Michael| I mean I just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear.
Jan| I dont want to...
Michael| Ok. Come on Jan. After all weve been through... 
Jan| Michael! Michael! Michael!
Michael| We have a history... 
Jan| Michael.
Michael| ...between us.
Jan| Dont say another word.
Michael| I wont
Jan| Get yourself down stairs.
Michael| Im just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
Ryan| You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Stanley| This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
Jan| Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means... 
Phyllis| Mistake.
Meredith| Slip.
Jan| Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesnt make sense.
Kelly| What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
Jan| Excuse me?
Kelly| I mean thats a baseball term, right?
Jan| I dont know what Michael was talking about. I dont know.
Kelly|  ...and you went to Chilis and he got to second base with you.
Jan|  Kelly, I dont know what Michaels talking about.
Kelly|  He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term... 
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey!
Pam| Hows it going down there?
Jim| Its a complete... well, actually its exactly what youd expect, so... How are the girls?
Pam| Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Jim| Did you really?
Pam| No. 
Jim| Oh.
Pam| Almost.
Jim| Good.
Pam| Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. Theres this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Jim| Nice. Well, whats it all about?
Pam| Um...
Jim| I think you should do it. Thats great!
Pam| Its really cool.
Michael| Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
Angela| Are you married?
Jan| Im divorced.
Phyllis| That must have been hard.
Jan| It was. Yes.
Kelly| You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with Michael.
Jan| I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Phyllis| Mmmm, I think were all okay with the balance weve struck.
Angela| At least you dont have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Jan| Okay. Lets take five. I think we can all use five.
Kelly| How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Michael| Hi.
Jan| Did you take care of the situation?
Michael| Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
Jan| Excuse me.
Michael| I have essentially. Yes. Ive taken some... 
Jan| Excuse me. Ive been told theres been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Pam| Dreams are just that. Theyre dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. Its nice but... um... I dont know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Jim| So youre not doing it.
Pam| How did you know?
Jim| Why not?
Pam| Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Jim| Come on.
Pam| Roys right. Theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway.
Jim| Roy said that.
Pam| What? You have something you want to say?
Jim| You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Pam| Oh, excuse me! Im fine with my choices!
Jim| You are?
Pam| Yeah.
Pam| Its impractical. Im not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they dont even make houses like that in Scranton. So, Im never going to... .
Michael| Im just going to put this over there.
Darryl| This is not a good idea right here.
Michael| You did uh... okay.
Michael| Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
Michael| Hey. Um... look guys, Im sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
All the Men| Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
Michael| Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
Michael| Thank you to our hosts.
Darryl| Hey Michael. This aint over.
Michael| Ahhh! Excellent.
Michael| Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
