Jim| Well done.
Michael| Kay.
Jim| Topical.
Michael| I am king of forwards. Its how I like to do business, everybody joking around. Were like Friends. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
Dwight| So the monkey does the sex thing right here!  
Michael| Thats funny! Thats funny. Not offensive. Uh... because its nature. Educational. 
Dwight| Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Michael| Um, I... 
Dwight| Consider it?
Michael| Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, well see. Because I... I dont know if its...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
Todd Packer| What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom?  This guy!
Michael| Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Todd Packer| 
Michael| Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Todd Packer| bleep, bleep. Whats up, Halpert? 
Michael| Uh oh.
Todd Packer| Still queer?
Michael| Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Michael| Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So... 
Michael| Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade A gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Todd Packer| Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You dont know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So heres the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
Michael| Really? Here we go! Buckle up. Its going to be a bumpy one!
Todd Packer| Were talking blonde incompetent.
Michael| Oh, yeah.
Todd Packer| Like 10 words a minute... talking. 
Michael| Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, theres a lot of dumb people out there.
Todd Packer| They are women, right?
Michael| Oh! Wow! I didnt say it! I didnt say it!
Todd Packer| I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Michael| Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Jim| Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!
Todd Packer| Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Michael| Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan? 
Todd Packer|  Come on, kid. Lets go.
Michael| Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Jim| Except pass that breathalyzer.
Ryan| You a big William Hung fan?
Todd Packer| Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
Kevins computer| 
Jim| Im really excited to meet your Mom.
Pam| You are?
Pam| My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesnt have a cell phone... which is cool cause its kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping shell walk in.
Pam| Ive decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Jim| Oh yeah?
Pam| mmhmm.
Jim| Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Pam| Oh really?
Jim| Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Michael| Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. Im going to forward it like its hot.
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| Forward it like its hot. Forward it like its hot. "Old School".
Toby| Michael?
Michael| Yes, Toby?
Toby| Um... I need to talk to you in your office. Itll just take two seconds.
Michael| Um... literally two seconds?
Michael| Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So hes really not a part of our family. Also hes divorced so hes really not a part of his family.
Toby| The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
Michael| No, no, Toby. No.
Toby| Its really not a big deal, Michael.
Michael| It is a big deal. Its a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Toby| And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer... 
Michael| What?
Toby| Just to refresh you... .
Michael| NO!
Toby| on our policy. 
Michael| What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? 
Toby| Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Michael| There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. Thats why its a joke.
Michael| Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know youre all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.
Toby| Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so Ill go over that later.
Michael| I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just cant wait to see how you handle it.
Michael| A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is whats at stake.
Michael| Time to bring out the big guns. Im heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke thatll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. Im looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Darryl| Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Michael| Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. 
Darryl| Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Whered you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Roy| Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy| Oh!
Michael| Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Darryl| Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you dont have a lot of business to start with.
Michael| Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Roy| Hey, hey, hey. 
Michael| What?
Roy| So you dont have the biggest package. Dont feel bad. 
Michael| I dont feel bad.
Darryl|  I think he feels bad.
Michael| No, I dont.
Roy| You look like you feel bad.
Michael| Okay. 
Roy| Little package!
Michael| Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse guy| Little package! Little package!
Michael| Thank you.
Roy| You look good.
Darryl| Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys| 
Toby| So remember, intent is irrelevant. And thats it. Pam?
Pam| Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Moms coming in today.
Kevin| MILF!
Pam| Thanks, Kevin.
Pam| Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Pam| Shes coming in today and maybe just dont joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby| Great point.
Pam| Thank you.
Toby| Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, lets just act everyday like Pams Moms coming in. All right. Thats it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. 
Michael| Hi, is it over?
Toby| Uh, yes!
Michael| No.
Toby| I can go over it with you.
Michael| I know, I know. Its good. It is not over. It is not over til its over.
Toby| Its over.
Michael| Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didnt because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what were losing? Seriously?
Angela| Email forwards.
Michael| Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela| I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or youll have bad luck.
Michael| Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirls outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Stanley| That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls school. I am taking it down right now. 
Meredith| Um... what about office romance?
Toby| Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So lets just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. 
Phyllis| All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Michael| I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Dwight| Yeah, Meredith.
Michael| No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? 
Dwight| Yes.
Michael| She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin| She wasnt that hot.
Michael| Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
Toby| Ok, you know, Michael... 
Jim| Im in an office relationship. Its special. Um... shes nice. Shes shy. Shes actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that youd be on camera. Im sorry, shes European. No, I told you that youd be on camera. Stop it.
Michael| What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line? 
Toby| No.
Michael| What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby| Well, that would be... 
Michael| At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby| Okay, Im lost.
Michael| Okay. Well, then lets act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! Well use the doll. Pam. Pam? 
Video| 
Michael| I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Tobys video that hes showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Jim| No, thanks. Im good.
Michael| Thats what she said. Pam?
Pam| Uh... my mothers coming.
Michael| Thats what she sai   Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
Dwight| Hey, Toby.
Toby|  Hey Dwight.
Dwight| You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Toby| Sure.
Dwight| Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like? 
Toby| Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... Im just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Toby| Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Dwight| Good. Good. And... 
Toby| I should get back to work.
Dwight| Okay.
Man in Video| In todays fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Lets take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves where is the line?
Video| 
Roy| Natural redhead.
Actor| Hey, Rach.
Redheaded Actress| Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor| Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Darryl| Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! Thats that girl from that thing.  I banged this girl right here. This is... 
Roy| Thats her?
Darryl| Yes, this is the one.
Roy| No!
Darryl| You remember? Yes!
Roy| At the party?
Warehouse guy| You banged her?
Darryl| Yes!   Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Michael| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
Jan|  Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then.  Hi.
Michael| Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video were watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
Todd Packer| Dont ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Pam| I dont have any DUIs so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Todd Packer| Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dudes thong? Probably.
Michael| So you are the lawyer, Mr. OMalley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. OMalley| I love lawyer jokes.
Michael| Well, its probably because you dont get em.
Michael| When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I dont come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldnt arrest a guy whos just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
Jan| You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. Whats the problem? 
Michael| The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I cant say anything.
Jan| Well, that... thats true in a way. You cant say anything. 
Michael| Wheres the line? Wheres the line, Jan.
Jan| Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Michael| No, Ive seen the video.
Toby|  He talked the whole time.
Michael| No, I didnt.  Huh, what? 
Michael| Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Jim| Does that include Thats What She Said?
Michael| Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim| Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so... 
Michael| THATS WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan| Michael. MICHAEL!
Michael|  Come on.
Jan| Michael, please.
Todd Packer| There he is.
Michael| Mwah! 
Todd Packer| There he is. Good one.
Michael| You would have done the same. You just didnt think of it first.
Jan| Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael| Its... Thats... 
Jan| Thats not my sense of humor.
Michael| Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. OMalley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Jan| Wha... 
Michael| I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny|  And motorcycle head injuries, workers comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
Michael| This guy does it all.
Jan|  Scuse me, Im sorry.  Michael. Mr. OMalley is your lawyer.
Michael| What?
Jan| Mr. OMalley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Michael| So Im not in trouble?
Michael| I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You cant be too careful about what you say. Mo money, mo problems.
Michael| Okay. Well, lets get you out of here, James. Um... I think were under an hour still, so... 
Albiny| Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
Michael| I know. Well talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
Pams Mom| Um... hello.
Pam|  Oh my god!
Pams Mom| Finally made it!
Pam| Hello!
Pam| I love my Mom. Okay. Thats probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Pams Mom| This is all yours?
Pam| Yeah. Im in charge of this whole area.
Pams Mom| Oh, my goodness. Thats great.
Todd Packer| So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! Thats incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I dont know where youre going, just be out of here by five!"  Boom!
Pam| This is where I used to keep my computer.
Pams Mom| Oh, right! I remember... 
Pam| But then I moved it.
Pams Mom| with the picture.
Pam| Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So... 
Pams Mom| Sure.
Pam| So this is like, um, an organization station... 
Pams Mom|  Oooooh!
Pam| Hey!
Pams Mom| Well, there he is!
Roy| How are ya?
Pams Mom| Hi, handsome!
Roy| You look great!
Pams Mom| Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
Pam| Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, its okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Pams Mom| Oh, I dont believe that.
Roy| Okay, Im going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Pams Mom| Oh, anything is fine.
Roy| All right, Ill see ya.
Pams Mom| So which one is Jim?
Pam| Mom!
Pams Mom| I just wanted to know.
Pam| No.
Pams Mom| All right. Okay.
Pam| Ten minutes.
Pams Mom| Okay.
Pam| Then we can go to dinner.
Pams Mom| Ill make myself busy.
Todd Packer| Theres this guy. Hes at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched cause all these women are smokin hot perfect 10s, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... 
Kevin| Phyllis?
Michael| No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Todd Packer| Ex-squeeze me?
Michael| Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Kevin| Packer said it.
Michael| No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Phyllis| Im the same age as you, Michael.
Michael| I dont know about that.
Phyllis| Were in the same High School class.
Michael| Well, I have a late birthday and usually Septembers a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? Theres a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin| You mean where my desk is?
Michael| Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin| Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael| Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer| Oh my. They really got to you, didnt they?
Michael| They didnt get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  Cmere, cmere, cmon!  Come on! Come on.
Phyllis| Michael! Come on! 
Michael| Oooh!
Phyllis| You dont have to worry. Im not going to... 
Michael| Im not worried.
Phyllis| ...report you to HR.
Michael| You know what? The only thing Im worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Michael| Times have changed a little. And even though were still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy cant take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
Pam| He said what?
