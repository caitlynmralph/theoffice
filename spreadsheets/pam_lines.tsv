 Well. I dont know.
 What?
 Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
 You havent told me.
 Uh, yeah, the one...
 You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
 I have an important question for you.
 Are you going to Angelas cat party on Sunday?
 This is Mr. Scott.
 I dont think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I dont think its many little girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks theyre good.
 Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
 You just still have these messages from yesterday.
 What?
 Dont we all?
 Nothing.
 I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
 Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, hes on to me. Um...
||
 Yeah.
 So when are we going out?
 OK. Yeah.
 Hey.
 Roys my fiance. Weve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think were gonna get married in the spring.
 Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
 OK. Im gonna be a few minutes. So its only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
 You got a fax.
 What? Why?
 Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
 Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
 Are you serious?
 I cant believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and youre firing me.
 Youre a jerk.
 Hey.
 Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
 Its better, thanks.
 Yeah.
 Is...?
 Um... Are you...
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
 Yeah, Freecell.
 I know. I saw that.
 Im saving that cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
 Um, hi. How are you?
 Great.
 Thank you.
 Thats nice, Dwight.
 OK, I like your food.
 OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
  Mmmm.
 Oh.
 Sorry.
 Im not making any copies.
 Nothing new.
 Theres nothing new.
 Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the...
 No. I have a life.
 You should try it sometime.
 ... your problem.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Where are you?
 Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out cause the...
 No youre not.
 OK.
 Still no one calling.
 Dwight, what...
 OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
 This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
 Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
 Dwights health care memo. I told you about it.
 Michael, he made huge cuts.
 Where are you going?
 Im inventing new diseases.
 So, lets say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
 Nice.
 Its an epidemic.
  Hey, Jim. Its Pam.
 Good, how are you? Busy?
 Um, Im not bothering you, am I?
 You dont have anything youre doing?
 Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. Im not really doing anything.
 I might go to the mall.
 I need new shoes.
 Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
 Um... Actually, we dont have any staff birthdays coming up.
 Oh.
 Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
 But its not until next month.
 You still want to have a party?
 How about green?
 This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her.
 It is... her birthday.
 An alliance?
 What does that even mean?
  Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
 Um, I dont know, Im just like, Im going a little crazy cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
 Yeah, hes making me take notes on these meetings and Im, like, "These people are my friends." But hes all like, "This is confidential. You cant tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me youre not gonna say anything.
 OK, yeah.
 Hes in a box?
  Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just dont know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
 Happy Birthday.
 Oh, tell me, tell me.
  Thats perfect!
 Hey, Hey!
 Come on.
 Its just office pranks.
 My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesnt make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? Im kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
  No, no, I know that the warrantys expired, but isnt it supposed to last longer than two years if it isnt defective? OK, fine, three years.
 Please dont throw garbage at me.
 I dont think so Michael. Besides, I cant cheer against my fiance.
 Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
 Yeah, Im just forwarding the phones.
 Yeah, youre gonna need it.
  Im just saying, Roy is very competitive.
 And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
 Um, I think Im gonna be up at the lake.
 Woo!
 Mmm-hmm.
 Hey.
 Yeah, hes, uh, pretty good, huh?  Lets get you into a tub.
 Uh, Michael?
 Hey, theres a...
 Theres a person here...
 Theres...
 Theres a person here who wants to sell handbags.
 Okay, I told her youd talk to her.
 Okay.
 Theres an HR meeting in there at 1130.
 No.
 Thats a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
 Its nice having Katy around. Its another person for Michael to um, interact with.
 Were not dating, were engaged.
||
  Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
 Oh!
 Oh...
 Oh, God. Its sad. Its so sad.
||
 Youre horrible.
 Yeah, whats that?
 Im engaged. So...
 I wished, right?
 Yeah, I gave it to you.
 So, can I..?
||
 Thats what he said.
  Hi.
 Roy...
 Cut it out.
 Stop it.
  Cut it out.
 Stop.
  Stop, I cant breathe.
 Jim is a great guy. Hes like a brother to me.  Were like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
 Im bored.
 No, Im kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
 Really?
 What are you guys going to do?
 Thats great.
 Thats cool.
 I, I was gonna say, I think that um, were gonna help Roys cousin move.
 Cause Roys got a truck.
 Uh, huh. Yes.
 Great.
 Okay, Im gonna head back.
 Ugh...
 You know what they say about a car wreck, where its so awful you cant look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
 Michael has taped
 Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. Its great.
  It wasnt. I swear.
 Were not laughing at you, Dwight.
 Um, just something somebody wrote.
 Um, its kind of private.
 Okay, now Im laughing at you.
 Youre taking away our bathroom?
 Michael...
 ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
 Um...
 Sorry.
 ...because thats what happens every time!
 No.
  No, I dont want to go, I dont want to.
 If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
 Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
 Ill just get a ride home from Angela.
 Oh good, Im just in time for Ping.
  Can I get a drink?
 No, no. Cause the ice melts and then its like second drink!
 Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
 Woo! Hey, I havent gotten one yet!
 More Dundies!
 Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
 Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech
 I have so many people to thank for this award.
 Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldnt have done it without them.  Thank you. Lets give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
 Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
 And, I feel God in this Chilis tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
 Nothing.
 What?
 Dwight, get off me!
 Oh my God!
 I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
 I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
 Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
 Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
 Bye.
 You are?
 My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesnt have a cell phone... which is cool cause its kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping shell walk in.
 Ive decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
 mmhmm.
 Oh really?
 Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Moms coming in today.
 Thanks, Kevin.
 Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
 Shes coming in today and maybe just dont joke around about that stuff in front of her.
 Thank you.
 Uh... my mothers coming.
 I dont have any DUIs so I can drive myself, but thanks.
  Oh my god!
 Hello!
 I love my Mom. Okay. Thats probably really the most obvious statement ever.
 Yeah. Im in charge of this whole area.
 This is where I used to keep my computer.
 But then I moved it.
 Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
 So this is like, um, an organization station...
 Hey!
 Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, its okay, because I am very used to killing time.
 Mom!
 No.
 Ten minutes.
 Then we can go to dinner.
 He said what?
||
 Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, its up to me to revive him.
 You see Dwights coffee mug?
 Sometimes when hes not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
 Here.
 Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
 Oh.
  You headed out?
  Ok.
  Have a great time.
  Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
  Yup.
  Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
||
  Yeah.
 Now the bronze are really blue, and theyre also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
 Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
 In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
 The thing about Jim, is when hes excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
 Go!  Go!  Go!
 Its Phyllis!
 Flonkerton.
 Are you sure you dont want to play?
 Come on Angela, dont you have a game?
 Well, lets play, what is it?
 Were friends.
 I made something for our closing ceremonies.
 Automatic voicemail.
||
 I have 59 voicemails.
 Sure.
 Really?
 Cool.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask whos calling? Just a second.
 Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess theyre like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I dont know! You know? Theyre just... She calls him, and they... You know, Im sorry. I feel like Im talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
  Hey! You can just give her your extension.
 ...Would You Rather?
 Legends of the Fall?
 Well, I kind of liked Legal...
 I take it back.
 I take it back!
 Okay.
 Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
 Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
 Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
 No, my all time favorite!
 All time favorite.
 You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends.
 You should tell him.
 Dwight.
 Kay.
 Hey!
 Um... Oscars kind of cute.
 Ooh, Toby!
 I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
 Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
  You wanted me?
  Papier-mache?
 Hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Why did you put it off until Halloween?
 I think its gonna put a damper on the party a little.
 So its a man?
 I just answer the phone.
 Youre costume is fantastic!
 Oh no, dont, dont, dont, dont.  Aah!  Okay...
 Okay, greatest strength.
 A dog-like obedience to authority
 But that doesnt sound good.
 Hes a gun nut.
 No, I made brownies.
 ... What?
 I made brownies.
 Im guessing Angelas the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
  Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
 Jim is really talented. And he should be the one whos getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
  Dont take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
 Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And its definitely a step up. And a challenge.
 Jim...
 What happened?
 Oh. That was like crazy. Cause I was...
 Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, Im sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
 I dont really have any control over that Stanley.
 Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and thats today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
 Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
 Its just last year you...
 Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
  Well, is that really a priority?
  Youre major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
 I am just following the website.
 Yes, you have very nice teeth.
 Could you practice on the forms?
 I dont know.
 French Onion?
 Ok.
 I just have a quick question.
 No, its not that. Um, I was just wondering, since Im probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
 Hes a purple belt. Thats really high.
 Its just out there, you...
 Yeah.
 What?
 Well, look closer.
 Once point for me.
 Oh, youre dead.
 Hey, put me down. Put me down.  Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
 Yeah, you too.
 The shipping place closes in a half hour.
 Wait, are those Michaels Levis?
 Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and Im not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know thats why he started casual Fridays.
  Ill take those. Thanks.
 What is going on?
 Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
 No, they had to come back for me.
 Umm... it was not that long ago.
 Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
  Ok, you want me to read em?
 Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
 When-
 Ok.  Theres a transcript between a naval ship-
 Sure.  Theres a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
 It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
 Of the FBI.
 What is that?
 Hey, uh, I have to work late.
 Heres what we think happened.  Michaels sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot whos causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesnt work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
 Yeah.
 For the bugs.
 Yes... nice!  I cant remember the last time someone made me dinner.
 What are you going to do with your time off?
  You have new music?
 What!?
 Oh, I dont know...  Oh my God.  This is Jans cell.
 Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh, really?
 Why might some say that?
 Uh hmm.
 We didnt dance.
 Swaying isnt dancing.
 I have some faxes to get out.
 Its performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I dont really know what to expect.
 Thank you.
 Oh, no.
 Uh, just off the top... I think shell be here this afternoon.
 She missed you.
 I have one idea of what it means.
 Well I dont think youre gonna be very happy with this.
 Because shes conflicted.  She has to be professional, but shes fighting feelings... for you.
 Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
 Michael and Jan definitely made out.
 Maybe more.
 Oh, yea!
 Michael?
 Jans on the phone for you.
 Sorry.
 What suggestion box?
 Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
 Sure.
 Hey, Jim.
 Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night?
 Can you believe who Trump fired?
 You didnt see it?
 Michael, its time for the suggestion box meeting.
 You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
 Everyones waiting in the conference room.
 Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
 How do you come back from that?
 No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
 As a human being.
  Thank you.
  Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
 I know!
 Do you think that theyre like-
 No, right, no, no.
 Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
 Its like squishing a spider under a book.  Its gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that its really dead.  Sooo...  If you guys see anything... ?
 Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
 One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
 Ummmm...
 Hey, Angela-
 Hows it going?
 Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jims party tonight?
 No. I mean, I dont know, I dont think so.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 The professors would go to the parties?
  What?  Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
 Really? Thats great.
 Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
 Oh, no, he cant make it.
 No thanks.
 Hey.
 Definitely.
 Jims bedroom.
 Cool... This is your desk.
 Your home office?
 Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
 Ok, wait, so that would make me  like right here.
 And Dwight would be like-
 Umm,  yearbook!
  Ooooohhh no!
 You were so dorky!
 Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
 Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
 Thats ok.  Its ok.
 Oh, yeah I gave that up.
 Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
 Just because two people are hanging out, it doesnt mean that theyre together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
 You do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party.
 I think the tree looks nice.
  Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. Its awesome.
 Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
 Ill take the iPod.
 I want the iPod.
 Well, I mean, its an iPod. But ..
 Sorry, I ..
 Maybe because you hated her present so much.
 How much?
 I know. Its totally going to change the way I work out.
 So what are you going to get me instead?
  No, I was just checking out my present.
 I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
  Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
 Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
 Oh, my God! Its incredible.  Is this the Boggle timer?
 Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, its a pencil cup.
 Um, I dont think so, I just bought it.
 I love these.
 Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
 A ski mask and a swimsuit.
 And brush our teeth.
 How about the anchor?
 I think youre thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
 No, Im not going to do that.
 Hey, why dont we find like a quieter place to hang out?
 Its getting kind of rowdy down there.
 Sometimes I just dont get Roy.
 I mean, I dont know. So... whats it like dating a cheerleader?
 Im cold.
 Uh, Ive been engaged for three years, and theres no end in sight. So... you dont wanna ask my advice.
 No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
 No, thank you.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Michael, whats wrong?
 Ok, wait wait wait wait...
 Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
 Ok...
 Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
||
 Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
 Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
 Michael, why dont you call your girlfriend?
 What was that?!
 Ohhhhhh!
 Oh my gosh.
 Is he ok?
 You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
 No, I didnt mention that you cooked your foot.
 You didnt have any.
 And do my job?
 Its just that before, you said that you didnt want any special treatment.
 Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
 Youve seen one of these?
 Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  Im trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
 Really?
 Oh! Ha, haha.
 Pan?
 Oh, God.
  What.
 Tell me before I come there.
 No.
 No.
 Really?
 What?!
 That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!
 Oh God no, Dwight isnt my friend... Oh my God!  Dwights kind of my friend!
 No, hes actually been really nice and helpful.
 Wow...
 Dwight, you have your hand up.
 Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
 Get up, get up.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 I know.
 I just want to say goodbye ok?
 Yes, I know, but its gonna be different.
 Its just hard to explain.
 Oh my goodness!
 Come here.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
 I cant believe hes getting a CAT scan.
 Really? Michael went in with him?
 Wow.
 Ok, thats uh, good news  Uh, yeah, no Ill let you go.
 Ok. Bye.
 Hey, Oscar?
 I just wanted to let you that Dwights gonna be ok.  The doctor said theres a really simple treatment for a concussion, so hell probably even be back at work tomorrow.
 I just, uh, thought youd want to know that.
 Oh, I can not believe I fell for that.  Oh, my God.
 I bought my veil.
 Ummm...
 Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I dont know, like loose with big curls and...
 Thats a communal bowl.
 Sick, like lots of sniffling. I dont know.
 Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
 Ok, it was the second one.
 Nuh-uh.
 What did you guys talk about?
 I hate you.
 Hey.
 Did you find anything good in your desk?
 Score.
 Big day.
 Oh.
 Right.
 No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
 No, I mean, just cause we like got along so well.
 So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
 Mmm, hmm.
 Cool.
 Hey, heres your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
 Oh, no, thats, you dont have to.
 No, really, its okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
 Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
 Yep.
 Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
 Right.
 It was great.
 Mm-hm.
 Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
 What?
 I dont know.
  Oh... I dont know.
 No, I dont think its a bird.
 Open the door up!
 Thanks!
 A little.
||
 Youre gonna throw my things on the ground?
  ...back so soon.
 Yeah, right.
 Yeah, thats right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
  Are you kidding?
 Somebody did something bad to Michaels carpet. Maybe thats all we need to know.
 That doesnt seem fair.
 Whats our punishment?
  Hey, Jim.  Its Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michaels there and its horrible.  Anyway, Im bored.  Come back!
  Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I cant see Michaels head.  Its working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
   Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
  Ill transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what wouldve happened, so thank you.
  Hey, whats that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
  Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and Im not messing this up, so Ill see you tomorrow.
  Calling from my cell phone.  I dont know if you guys figured out who did that to Michaels carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
 Todays a women in the workplace thing. Jans coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I dont really know what. But Michaels not allowed in. She said that about five times.
 Jan.
 Michaels still at the door.
 Mmmhmm.
 I dont know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
 Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and Id still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
 Thanks.
 Well... I have a job right now, so I cant really take time off...
 Well... its just that the weekends arent good because, um...
 Hey.
 Hows it going down there?
 Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
 No.
 Almost.
 Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. Theres this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
 Um...
 Its really cool.
 Dreams are just that. Theyre dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. Its nice but... um... I dont know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
 How did you know?
 Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
 Roys right. Theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway.
 What? You have something you want to say?
 Oh, excuse me! Im fine with my choices!
 Yeah.
 Its impractical. Im not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they dont even make houses like that in Scranton. So, Im never going to... .
 I really like Valentines Day in this office. Its kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwights head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
  Phyllis.
 Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
 Thats OK.
 Guess what?
 Thats great.
 OH, Holy God!
 You cant fire me, Dwight, just cause Michaels not here.
 You need to get something for your girlfriend.
 Tightly wound?
 Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
 No, not like a ham. Its about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
 That you remember her.
 Yeah.
  Oscar.
  Join the club.
 Hey.
 I guess, yeah.
 Nothing, its just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
 I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping youd get me
 Heading out?
 Bye.
 Night Phyllis.
 Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
 Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
 Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... Ill uh show them to you later.
 Ok, cool.
 I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I dont want to offend... Angela... or someone.
 Mom, Im sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
 Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
 You mean Toastmasters?
 Yeah, the bride doesnt really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
 Roy has a connection. Its nicer than you think.
 Of course. Hes one of my closest friends.
 Maybe well use a DJ. Thats the one thing Roys in charge of for this wedding but all hes managed to do is set a date.
 Ryan, you should be more sensitive. Its obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
 Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
 Thats awesome. Where are you staying?
 When are you leaving?
 Oh.
 Oh yeah. Thats too bad.
 Its ok. I got it.
 Im looking forward to Take Your Daughter to Work day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because Im getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
 Oh, I have more.
 Oh, Michael. You cant be nasty today.  Cause of the...
 I reminded you last night.
 Dont you think you should say something?
 Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
 Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? Its actually pretty cool.
 I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
 That is!
 Hes not coming out. He wont pick up the phone.
 So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. Shes
 Mmhmm.
 Sure.
 Youre welcome.
 Its not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
 Really?
 Okay. Um... here it is. Dont put your fingers in there.  Cool huh?
 Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
 I know.
 I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.
 My theory is that...
 Happy birthday Michael.
 I said happy birthday.
 Ones good.
 Michael wants a strippergram?
 Michael, I have Jan on the line.
 I can sign for it.
 When does he hear?
 Ohh... poor Kevin.
 If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
 ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
 Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
 And his favorite lunch.
 You use fabric softener?
 No, I do.
  We should probably head back.
 You dare me? How old are you?
  Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
  Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
 Oh Im sorry. Im sorry.
 I hate you.
 No.
 Who is that?
 I got it.
 Michael?
 This is from all of us.
 Michaels birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I dont know... It was a good day.
  Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes hell look up at me from his desk and hell just be someone else. Like hell go um,  thats supposed to be Phyllis.  I cant do it as good as he can.
 He does everyone in the office.
 Jinx! Buy me a coke.
 No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.
 Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
 Sorry, thats not my problem.
 Hey guys, whats going on?
 Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.
 I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
 Uh, hmmm.
 Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
 What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just cant for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.
  Here.  Just buy it from me. I havent talked to you in hours and its been weird and I really want to know what the hells going on with Dwight.
 Hey.
 Ten minutes.
 No.
 Yeah?
 Oh, thanks!
 Uh...
 There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  its my wedding. And I dont want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
 Win!
 How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
 Win.
 Win
 Hey, Angela. I didnt have your zip code.
 Nice.
  Um... lets move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
 Wait, what did it say?
 I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And Ive been really nice to her... and I havent told anyone. And what the hell?!
  Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
 I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
 I cant believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
 Dont take her side.
 I dont know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
 Yeah.
 Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
  I am.  Its about the Save The Date.
 What?!
 Okay.
 Its a nice tux.
 Come on, itll be fun, and besides, Im a roulette expert.
 No, they stopped making that show.
 No, thats Afghan.
 Oh, nothing.
 Theyre wedding bands.
 Roy was supposed to pick the band, but hes concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
 Theres a KISS cover band in here.
 Im pretty happy these days. Im getting married soon and Im getting along with everybody at work.
 I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
 Have three stages, yeah.
 Oh.
 Oh, wait. Thats Kevin. On the drums.
 On the drums! On the drums!
 Oh, my...
 No! No!
 No, come back! No, no, no!
 Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
  Michael, Carol Stills for you.
 Carol Stills.
 Your realtor.
 Sometimes I dont put Michael through until hes already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
 Carol, youre on with Michael.
 Michael, Jans on line two.
 Its still me. Uh, Jan, heres Michael.
  Oh, my God!
 "Yeah, right," what?
  I have good cards.
 Mhmm, And Im gonna take you all-in.
 Straight.
 Its okay. Ill see you at home.
 Okay.
 Bye! Hey.
 Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
 About when you want to give me more of your money?
 Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. Im feeling kind of good tonight.
 What?
 What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
 Well, I um... I... I cant.
 You have no idea...
 ...what your friendship means to me.
  About 10 minutes ago. No, I didnt know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I dont know, mom, hes my best friend.  Yeah, hes great.  Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim...
 Me too.  ...I think were just drunk.
 No...  Jim---
  Chicken.
 Excellent, thanks.
 Yeah, I didnt go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I cant really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But Im, Im doing well.  I have my own apartment.  Im taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
 Michael, Dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer.
 Yeah?
 No, I didnt.
 What was Oprah about?
 Thats a really big decision.
 Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
 Or not adopt.
 Roys sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
 You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
 Yeah.
 You probably wont.
 No, Michael.
 No, Michael.
 Sure.
 This.
 Thank you.
 Yes, I have a date. Hes a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. Im kind of nervous. I havent been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldnt broadcast that.
 Ill probably just wear this.
 Um...
 Mm-hmm.
 Hey! Whats up?
  Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. Hes not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. Whats up?
 Okay. Well, if you think of it, Ill be here.
 So how do you come up with your cartoons?
 You dream in cartoons? How fun!
 Huh.
 Freedom fries. Yeah.
 Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
 More freedom fries.
 Thats great.
 I went on a date. It wasnt a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, Ill just kinda know.
  Popcorn anyone?
  Anyone else?  Nooo.
 Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, its been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
  Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.
 Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
  Ok.
 Really?  I dont know.
 Not at work, Ill try it on---
  ...noooo
  Its too much.
 Im gonna return it.
 Hi.
 Thanks.
 I have this little vacuum cleaner thats broken.  If Dwight doesnt work out, maybe that could be manager.
 What?
 Please go back to your desk.
  Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But Im gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, itll be cool to just have some after work clothes that arent pajamas.
 Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
 But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
  With cream and sugar?
 The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
 Is there anything I can do?
 Yeah.
 Oh.  Okay.
  Okay.
 Oh.  I would like a break.
 Great.
 I think so.  I dont know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
 You waited for me?
 Lets see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
 Is it for the bird?
 I have it covered.
 If you wanna do something for the funeral...
 Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
 Do you have it with you?
 Did I wake up this morning thinking Id be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
 Actually, I have it.
 Id also like to say a few words if thats okay.
 What do we know about this bird?  You might think, "Not much.  Its just a bird."  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe its that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
 And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I dont think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
 An impression, then.  Lastly, we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesnt mean he was alone.  Because Im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
  Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
 Hi.
 Oh, I dont know if Im...
 Its weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately its like hes five.
 Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. Its really not a big deal. To some people it is.
 Michael.
 Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
 Hey, why dont you just go up to your office, get some work done, and Ill just bring you a pretzel.
 You know, I just think its really important that you be productive today.
 Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. Hes, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
 Night.
 20 past 5.
 PM.
 These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
 This is a huge sale.
 Night, Michael.
  Dunder Mifflin.
 Oh my God.
 Hi.
 Oh.
 I had to work late. Jans making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
 Yeah, totally. So...
 Do you...
 Uh, no, I um. Everythings pretty much the same here.
 A little different. What time is it there?
 Oh, yeah. Right.
 I dont know. It felt far.
 What?
 I type 90.
 Its true.
 70? How many do you type?
 Come on. Tell me.
 You have to tell me now.
 No, its, thats respectable.
 So ok. Im watching the movie, by myself...
 Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
 And, Im freaking out.
 That movie is so scary!
 But Im holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
 Because I got it at Blockbuster and they dont put the pictures on the box.
 Would I make that up?
 Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
 I have one kitchen.
 Its actually...
 Three kitchens?
  Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
 Um. Ok, bye.
 No, I was um...
 You have to go?
 No, I should probably go too.
 I mean, yeah.
 Bye Jim.
 Really you do. I love the material.
 I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
 Oh, I dont know. I havent decided yet.
 I just feel kind of tired, you know.
 Maybe. I just ...I dont really have anyone to go with.
 Very official.
 I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least Im not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
 Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
 Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
 Its hot in there. Hows the naan?
 I am. You should come dance with us.
 No one.
 Here.
 Yeah.
 Uh... no.
 Well, you were never really engaged.
 Yeah.
 I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
 What are you doing?
 Im rejecting your...
 ...kiss.
 If you sit in the back.
 You say one more word; Im stopping the car.
 Are you okay?
 What did Jan want?
 What cant you tell me?
 What?!
 You just said that were gonna be gone...?
 Michael, whats going on?
 Its a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe thatll stop now.
 Oh, good... youre bringing Dwight.
 Hes not here. I dont know where he is.
 Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
 Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
 Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
 I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
 Thats, um... I hadnt thought about it, huh.
 Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
 No thanks, guys.
 Have fun though.
 Really? Where did you hear that?
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, me too.
 Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. Theres another annoying boss, another desk, Id have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
 Hey!
 Howd the run go?
 Thats great!
 Because he accomplished something.
 Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
 Really?
 Oh, Ill just time him later.
 Yeah. Are you ready?
 Set
 Go!
 Am I being mean to Dwight? I dont know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isnt even a stopwatch. Its a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if youre going to beat Toby.
 I should probably get back to work.
 Good morning!
 Okay.
 Yes! Im in a good mood today! Im excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. Thats always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
 Hi!
 Im Pam.
 Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
 Oh my god! Its really you!
 I know. I dont care.
 Its really good to see you.
 You wont be disappointed.
 Hey.
 What happened to grape soda?
 Oh. Youve changed so much.
 So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
 Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
 Yeah. I know, me too.
 The days going fine. Its been a little chaotic but its fine. Its great! A lot of distractions. But, its good.
 Hey!
 Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
 Whats up?
 What do you mean?
 Oh. Thats totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
 Were friends. Well always be friends.
 Its good to have you back.
 Ohhhh! Shes absolutely adorable!
 ...Oh, sorry. Hes--hes dressed all in pink.
 ...Oh. Thats... fun for him.
  Who is it?
 Why would anyone go to jail for that?
 Okay. Angela?
 My dad.
 What was prison like?
 Yeah, some days I never go outside.
 They have art classes?
 Kinda sounds like... prisons... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
 Wow... I--
 Wow. That was... wow.
 Michael, its freezing out.
 Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
 Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
 Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
 Dwight, what uh...
 Well, get it out of here.
 I would like it off my desk.
 Can I help you, Michael?
 Its behind you.
 Michael?
  I didnt, its from corporate.
 Yup.
 Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, Ill just tell you.
 For the past few months Ive been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
 Theyre considering him for a top secret mission. Theres his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised hed never ever tell.
 So... heres the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didnt wrap it.
 Oh.
 Oh yeah.
 No, I get it, of course. OK.
 Michael, whats going on?
 I know.
 OK, well, why are you laying like that?
 Like what?
 Well.. um I, I dont...
 I dont need to know.
 No, thank you.
 I feel like Ive been kinda cold to Karen and theres no real reason for it. I mean its not like shes ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldnt be cold to her.
 Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
 Um, usually like that.
 I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
 Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
 That could really be fun.
 You guys do a raffle?
 There is now. We just started it.
 Whats ours again?
 Oh right.
 Right, and if youre interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.
 You cant do that.
 Thats a great idea.
 You can have your snack in here.
 If youre using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, youre doing it wrong.
 Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
 Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
 Bye.
 Oh, yeah... Maybe.
 Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
 Our party is also starting now
 Good choice.
 We have vodka!
 I got goose bumps.
 What?
 Can I talk to you a second?
  In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
 Yeah, but we dont have a power cord.
 Mmm. Hmm.
 Well go tell everyone.
 Night.
 We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier.
 It costs seventy five dollars.
 Ohh...
 Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  thats nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
 OK.
 Its kind of serious.
 How was Jamaica?
 Thats good.
 Huh.
 Its kind of an impoverished country.
 But you cant today, were doing inventory.
 We couldnt do it without you, so we postponed.
 Oh my God. Is that Jan?
 On the left.
 Hey.
 You OK?
 You sure?
 Oh. You want to talk about it?
 Hmm.
 How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
 Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
 No, I didnt mind helping Jim with his problem. Thats what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
 Oh, dont worry about it. I mean, its better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, its Jan on the phone for you.
 Hell call you back. OK, great.
 Hey.
 What are you doing out here?
 Jan called. Shes coming in later to talk to you.
 Thats all she said.
 Sorry?
 Oh, yeah, no. Dont worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
 Sure.
 What? No, its not... its nothing.
 Yeah.
  Thanks. You dont need to stay here.
 Yeah.
 Great.
 Who is Long Tim?
 I would love to meet Long Tim.
 Yeah.
 Ok. Bye Harvey.
 Really?
 Ok. Sure.
 Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
 Thats great.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  This is Pam. I did?
 Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And Id like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
 Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
 $100.
 Cool. Congratulations.
 Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
 Oh.
 Oh?
 Hmm. I dont think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
 No, thanks. I had some already.
 Oh, but, hey, Jim.
 I won an art contest today.
 Thanks.
 I sent in one of my watercolors.
 It was the new one I did.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
 Oh, that wasnt the night crew. That was Dwight.
 Oh, Im kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
 Nope.
  Hmm.
 Angela?
 Is everything okay?
 Yeah.
 I think we broke his brain.
 No, I will not.
 What?
 No.  No.
 Somethings up with Jim and Karen.  Not that Ive been eavesdropping.  Its not really any of my business, but Ive gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jims neck.
 Hey.
 Ugh.
 Everything okay?
 Well you seem a little tired.
 You should get more sleep.
 Never underestimate the power of a good nights sleep.
 When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
 Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
 Yeah.  Dont fall asleep at your desk.   Oh my God.
 I think thats champagne.
 But dont you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
 Okay Ben Franklin!
 Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
 Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
 What do you mean?
 Oh yeah.
 Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, youre going out with Jim.  Im not going out with Jim.  Youre dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
 Im not into Jim.  Yeah.
 Yeah.  Sorry.
 Um, what?
 Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
 I know.
 Didnt Ben Franklin have syphilis?
 Ohhh.
 Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan Im totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
 Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
 Thanks.
 Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like Wait, thought I called that off.
 Also, Pam and Roy.
 Thats my dress.
 What do you mean?
 Oh... um... no.  Thats... um... Thats actually fine
 Okay, thats a lot of good ideas. Thanks
 Hey.
 Youre kidding me, right?
 Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
 Yeah.
 Its okay.
 Hey!
 Oh... Im pacing myself.
 No. Im such a dorky dancer.
 Yeah, thats weird. I thought they only played the Police.
 Okay, just so you know, its just the students from my class in a little studio.
 Thanks.
 Im really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I dont mean it to be braggy.
 You too.
 Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
 Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
 I mean, its not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
 Dwight, what are you doing?
 Oh! No, you should go.
 ...And its all from the same series.
 Called Impressions.
 Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
 I hope so.
 I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you?
 Hey, Kenny.
 Yeah, Ill just, Ill drive myself home.
 Maybe, Im a little tired.
 Thank you.
 Oh, Michael.
 Yep.
 What do you mean?
 Um... you wanna buy it?
 Uh-huh.
  ... Thank you.
 Do you have something in your pocket?
 No thank you.
 So we shouldnt help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
 No, no.
 Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richards for happy hour. You should come.
 Ok, well, were going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. Im serious! If youre going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
 I have decided that Im going to be more honest. Im going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol Pammy is getting what she wants. And, dont call me Pammy.
 Oh, that duck is so cute.
 Hey guys.
 Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
 Hey. You made it.
 Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
  Oh.  No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
 Nice job.
 Oh yeah?
 Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
 Hey, dont you have a daughter?
 I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
 Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there cant be any secrets between us.
 Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
 He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
 Just listen.
 Dont yell!
 This is over.
 ROY!
 Roy dont!
 I really dont want to talk about it.  I dont mean to be rude, but I just... I dont want to comment on what happened.  It
 Oh my God, thats a womans suit!
 Michael, the pants dont have any pockets.
||
 Its been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
 Sorry I almost got you killed.
 He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  Its just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
 Not anymore.  Its, um... Its completely over now.
 Jim... I am really... sorry.
 I dont know.
 Im sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
 Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
 No, there were a lot of reasons.
 I know.
 Oh, welcome back, Andy.
 Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
 Its called being smart.
 I dont know how the whole betting thing started, but its fun.
 Ten...
 47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
 I dont understand the question.
 Yeah...
 Its really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
 So, youre okay?
 Hey Creed.
 Hey.
 Yes!
 What are the odds that this is in any way real?
 Oh... God.  Oh my God, hes gonna jump.
 Yeah...
 Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
 Come down and... open it and youll see.
 Dwight, what are you---
  Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
 Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
 Were having a press conference?
 Yes, Ill be sure someone returns your call.  Im so sorry.  Bye.
 Its just the Scranton Times...
 You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
 Yes.
 Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a womans touch.
 Cut.
 Cut.
 One day for what?
 OK.
 Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
 Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
  Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
 What? Really?
 Oh, my God.
  Can you tell us what happened?
  Its just, like, so creepy.
 Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
 Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
 Its disgusting and demeaning.
 Phallus?
 I dont often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
 Thats OK. I dont feel like answering phones.
  "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.
 Yeah.
 Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
  Oh.
 Oh, yeah. You really shouldnt litter.
 What do you want to dish about?
 OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
 Michael, you shouldnt do anything that youre uncomfortable with.
 Oh, my God.
 Michael, you need to get out of this.
 No, normal women dont do stuff like that. This is bad.
 Read the pros first.
 What was the last one?
 Michael... you shouldnt be with someone who doesnt make you happy.
 Maybe. But it sounds like youre just wrong for each other.
 No one said it has no calories.
 Im kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I dont need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
 Dont answer it.
 Here, uh... Meredith? Why dont you put your hazards on.
 I think Ive got it.
 I dont think we really need that, Michael.
 You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobes already coming in handy.  Coming!
 Good luck, Michael.
 Dont leave a -
 About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
 Michael?
 David Wallace is on line one.
 Oh, great. I forgot mine and Im wearing a two piece.
 Thanks Toby.
 I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
 You want me to write down peoples indefinable qualities?
 I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldnt I have the most boring job on beach day?
 Like what?
 Well... no, I dont... exactly... what?
 Theres nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.
 Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
 Whens the contest?
 How am I supposed to... get...
 I think theyre even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I dont really know how to compare those units.
 I really doubt it, Michael.
 Im gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. Thats the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
 Id like to try it.
 But Im not kidding.  I really want to do it.
 Do you want us to count to three?
 Michael, do something!
  Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
  Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldnt even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didnt any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. Its like sometimes some of you act like I dont even exist.   Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now were not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldnt have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didnt care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now youre with someone else. And thats... fine. Its... whatever. Thats not what... Im not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that Im just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. Its a good day.
 Hey. I think it looks great.
 After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where hes coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you.
 Hey.
 Um, about the beach...
 Oh, no its not that, Ive actually been thinking that for a long time, and Im glad I said it. I just... Im sorry if it made you feel weird.
 Wow, very funny.
||
 Hes from that company in Pitts...
 What do you want me to do?
 What about Meredith?
 So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
 Uh, sure.
 I really hope you get the job.
 Just dont get back together with her.
 This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
 Youre so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
 Right.
 Oh my God.
 No, its fine.  Im sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
  Good luck.
 Im happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe Im being cliche.  I dont care.  Cause I am what I am.  Thats Popeye.
 What happened?
 Thank you.
 Really?
 You will be your own assistant.
 Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
 I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do."
 Then who do you think will get the job?
  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
 I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
 Howd it go?
 Did... Karen get the job?
 Dwight, hello.
 No, I dont know what the future holds, but... Im optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day Ill find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... Im not gay.
 Medium rare.  Thanks.
 I know.
 Well, I wish you would.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, Ill transfer you.
 I havent heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldnt he?  Hes totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... thats OK.  Were friends.  And Im sure well stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  Its OK.  Im totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally---
 Yes.
  Im sorry, what was the question?
 It was for a video.
 A celebrity sex tape.
 Not relevant.
 Not relevant.
 It all happened so fast.
 Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. Its really nice to be good friends again.
 And Sunday Im thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
 Cool.
 Well have fun with that.
 Thank God you were there.
 Oh, Michael.
 Hey guys, were all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And were kicking in $5 for flowers.
 No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
 Yeah, I havent asked him yet.
 I was planning on it.
 Angela?
  Are you coming?
 Cant your other cats keep her company.
 Angela, youre the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldnt even be planning this, its your job.
 OK, were leaving for the hospital at 1.
 I can take 3 people.
 Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and well sign it outside her room.
 Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
 I...
 I was thinking that we...
 But...
 Michael! Michael!
  Its gonna be OK.
 Michael, Angelas cat died.
 Thats cool.
 Oh me too.
  Same religion.
 I can help you with that.
  I told you Im not dating anyone. And even if I was, I dont think its anyones business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when its for real, the last person Im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.  Trust me, when I fall in love, youll know.
 Michael Scotts Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
 Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
 Whats wrong?
 Hmm...
 Ah.
 Angela, Im sorry.
 Im more of a dog person.
 Well Im gonna start fast.
 Then Im gonna run fast in the middle.
 Then Im gonna end fast.
 Cause theyre just stupid.
 Yeah... That was um...
 Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
 ... Were dating.
 Ah, yeah. We havent told anybody, but its going really great.  Right?
 Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, thats over 25% of our funds?
 Giant check it is.
 Not well. A doctor wont come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
 And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
 I dont think so.
 Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.
 Hey.
 Oh my God.
 You said come in!
 Oh my God.
 So I closed the door but the image of his...
 ... dangling participle...
 ... still burned in my eyes.
  Come in.
 Yes. Or come in.
 On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
 Theyre so not.
 I didnt see where it started but I saw where it ended.
 They say if youre nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
 What? Look, no it was not...
 Yeah.  Oh were in last place.
 Darn it.
 I dont know Im really committed to winning.
 Mmm... Yes.
 Yeah.
  You like it? Its kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
 Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
 Im still having a nice day.
 Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
 And Michael, you dont have rabies. And chances are youre not going to get it anytime soon. So... you dont really have to think about it too much.
 Yeah, but theres other, better people out there who are helping.
 I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
 Hey.
 I gotcha one.
 Yeah.
 No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?
 Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
 Phones ringing.
  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
 You might want to trim it a little.
 Yeah, he is.
 Hey Toby.
 Well, I dont wanna speak for Jim, but, its like pretty official.
 OK.
  Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
 Yeah.
 No..
 No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque.
 You didnt say anything to me?
 Can you believe that...
 OK.
 Hi.
 In his office. You can go right in.
 Michael told us to wait in here. We dont know why.
 Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
 Oh.
 I think that I should help him get home.
 Hi.
 Nice to meet you.
 Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  Youre going to violate your own PDA memo.
 Hey.
 Its funny you bring that up because yes it is.
 I think... I mean, I dont know what it is but...
 I now find you repulsive.
 Eh...
 OK.
 Uh totally.
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
 OK.
 Yeah, Im gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I dont know what Im talking about but Im excited.
 So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? Id love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
 Thanks.
 Thatd be great.
 Oh... is it...
 No...
 Um...
 Im uh, Im dating Jim.
 Were together.
 Yeah, great.
 OK great!
 Great.
 Hey.
 I gotcha one.
 Yeah.
 No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?

 Im uh, Im dating Jim.
 Were together.
 Yeah, great.
 OK great!
 Great.
  I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didnt see it?  Did Jim say that I didnt see it? I saw it!
  Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
 He does.
  Dwight mercy killed Angelas cat.  Its very complicated.  Its caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
  Hes going through a break-up.
  What kind of prank are you thinking?
  Yes its too tight.
  Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
  Uh, just one second.  Were in a meeting and Ill see if hes available.  Its Jan.
  One of the tickets is for him.
  I won.
  Tie goes to the girlfriend.
  Heres a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why dont you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
  Hello.
  Um... uh... Ill get back to you.
 The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
 I said it normal.
 Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
 Im all over it.
 Yeah, enjoy this moment, because youre never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
 You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and theres no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt youre about to eat has expired.
 Yep.
 Nope.
 Ah-ha.
 Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
 Hes a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldnt be surprised that hes identified with her character.
 A suit?
 Like the main company number? Because Im gonna have to call information.
 You finished the movie.
 No. Go ahead.
 Mo Chuisle. Hes watching Million Dollar Baby... Hes gonna try to kill me.
  Michael, its Ryan for you.
 Hello, Im looking for a room.
 It says here you cater to the eldery.
 Trip Advsior.
 Two?
 Shoot!
 We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
 You wouldnt understand, Jim. Its a secret.
 The Beets Motel.
 Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
 I dont know!
 Oh my gosh.
 What are the themes?
 Irrigation.
 What?
 Yeah. Coward.
  Oh my God. What century is this?
  Ugh, your turn.
 Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
 Its whom when its the object of a sentence, and who when its the subject.
 How did he use it again?
 Whats up?
 Youre being gross.
 What moves?
 I cant believe thats not working.
 Um, I dont know if I really see you two together.
 Shes very religious.
 Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
 Thats right, you did.
 Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldnt do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
 Michael.
 Whats going on, why do you have a second job?
 Doesnt Jan have money?
 Man, Angela really had a hold on him.   Angela.
 We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
 Table making never seemed so possible.
 The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
 We really did.  It was fun.
 Dwight.
 Hey, I was thinking about dinner---
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Jims just really passionate about Italian food.
 Im taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
 No talk, Im animating.
 Are you serious?
 Oh my God, hes really in pain.
 Whos that?
 He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
 Right... youre a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
 You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
 No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
 Oh boy.
 Maybe, but its not good enough for me yet.
 No no, you can go home. Im good.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Thank you.
 I worked until about 245 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
  Yes?
 Certainly.  Okay, clear.
 Thanks.
 Oscar, did you bring it?
 Okay, well I have the tablecloth, dont forget the flatware.
 Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but were always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  Its very exclusive.
 Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
 Some people.
 I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
||
 Its Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
 And spend time with George Emerson.  Thats what I would do.  I mean its the best male protagonist weve read, right?
 Uh, Im sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
 I think its interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion.  And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucys torn between these two things.  Shes torn between passion and convention.
 It just-   To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
 Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
 Very brave choice also, I thought.
 Why dont you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
 Im so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
||
||
 Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasnt invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
 Did you sleep in cabins?
 Who went?
 Do you want me to ask where youre going?
 Great.
 Oh.
 Wow! Youre shaking things up a bit, huh?
 Do you think its a good idea?
  Hmm.
 Wow! That was easy.
  Conference room?
 Every time Michaels in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him whos on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesnt get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
 The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
 Hi, Kelly.
 I dont wanna guess.
 Jim. Can I see you for a second?
 Okay, its not regulation size, but itll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
 Please? Kellys trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
 Sorta, yes.
 Okay.
 Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
 He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
 Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. Hes in the conference room.
  Hows it going?
 Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
 Ill make the call.
  Yes! Way to go.  See that?
 You know what? Im sick of this! Lets go, you and me!
 Lets go. Pick up a paddle.
 I am.
 In my sleep.
 O.   P.
 We got you this.
 Its really nice.
 Uh-huh.
 So you have an office and a workspace?
 What a cute bench.
 Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didnt have audio for a week.
 Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
 Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 400?
  I dont care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
 Montana.
 Joe Montana!
 Why didnt you just say 49ers quarterback?
 Oh okay.
 Oh Jim, I dont think youre going to abandon this party here all by itself.
 You can buy new stuff but you cant buy a new party.
  Oh, thank you.
 Is there more wine in the kitchen?
 No, yeah. What?
 Oh, are you joking?
 I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
  Awesome.
  Like... like what?
 I know Jan didnt poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldnt it be me? Michaels former lover?
 And now you guys are dating?
  Flooded.
  This is the best burger Ive ever had, babe.

  Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
  Just, well just keep going.
  Yes.
  Yes.
  I have everything.
  Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.  What up, 212?
  I should really get going.
  Im sure it was really lovely.
  OK, bye.
  No, Michael.
  Im in the wrong class...
  Oh, no. I just--
   I can see you!
  This is so cool.
  Lunch with a girl from my hall.
  Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. Im gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
  Can you put me down Im getting a little nauseous?
  The nerve.
  Theyre on the supply shelf.
  New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The citys awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
  Hi.  Mmm. Cause--
  What?
  Really, where?
  Wow, was it the age difference?
  Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
   Nice.
  Sorry.
  Youve already disappointed him so much.  He cant be expecting a lot from you.
  I... listen, umm, were still good for this weekend, right?
  No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
  OK.
  Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
  What are you doing?
  Oh my God!
  Oh my God!
  Yes!
  Well, I should go.
 No, dont.  Im mad at them.
 Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
 What?  Why not?
 Come on, it wont be that bad.
  Hi everyone!
 Wow.
 No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi.
 Sorry.
  So you know Stacy, right?
 Theres no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
 So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogres DeTech half an hour early so they dont have to sit on the slab.
 Anyway, Bogres TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
 No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Dont interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
 So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way.  You cant reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacys new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
 Yes!
 No, its horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
 No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why cant you just be in art class with me?
 Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.
 Hey you!
 Not even. Im doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
 I cant hear anything, theres like, theres like machines going-
 I cant hear anything!
 OK.
 Im not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. Were just... a little out of sync.  You know, thats all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
 Hi.
  Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
 I figured Id catch you walking to your car, but...
 Ill leave a message.
 I guess this is just one of those days.  Itll get better.
 I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
 And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
 Youre probably upset that Im even at a Laundromat right now.  But, dont worry, Im being safe.  And Im headed home.  Im... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
 Anyway, um... I miss you.
 Okay, thanks.
 New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
 Hey.
 Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
 Hey Michael.
  You are such a dork! Shots!
 Im not drunk.
 Okay, I do not sound like that.
 Scranton.
 Hey.
 Thanks.  My costumes getting a lot of attention.
 So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I cant even take off my hat, because then Im Hitler.
 Hey!
 How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
 I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think theyre into the idea. Theyre probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, shes the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. Shes the best! The absolute best."
 Okay, so heres what Im thinking. Im gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasnt in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
 So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
 Okay, okay.
 Oookay....
 They came up with that idea really fast.
 Hey guys.
 Hi!
 Yup!
 Cute.
 Miles Davis.
 Chet ...something.
  Dizzy Gillespie.
 I dont know if Im gonna make any money with art.
 I mean its a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I dont try now, I never will. So...
 ... Got you.
 For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
 Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, its very subtle.
 Thank you.
 Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
  Hey, New York aint free. Get back to work.
 Its the worlds tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
 We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So were not telling anyone.
 I should go.
  I miss him.
 Dont give him Snoopy. Thats mine.
  What was that?
 Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
  Good luck.
 I love you.
  Jim? Jim?
 Maybe its because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
  Ooh, cute shoes online.
  Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
  Thats what she said! Thats what she said! Thats what she said!
  That was weird.
 Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didnt go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
 Did you do something to her?
 Well, somethings off.
 Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
  Right Dwight is loud.
 Hey, what are you doing here?
 Its Alex.
 Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
 OK.
 Whats up?
 Wow.
 Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
 Jims in Scranton.
 Ill see you tomorrow.
  Cant believe this.
  I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
 I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
 I have to stay and retake it.
 That means another twelve weeks.   Can you do this for another three months?
  I know.
  Right.
  Yeah Im fine.  Um... my cell phone batterys low, so I have to let you go.
 Alright.
  Love you. Bye.
 Im coming back the wrong way.   Its not because of you.  I dont like graphic design. Thats it.  Stop smiling. I really didnt like it.  Its just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you cant tell me what to do. Got it?
 I missed you too.
 Uh, yeah.
 Im not going inside.
  Oh, come on!  Do you see this?  Disgusting.
 Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
 Dont you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
 Just because someone likes things clean, doesnt mean theyre rich.
 When it comes down to it, its a health issue.  I should have written that.
  Why arent you as mad or interested in this as me?
 Are you inching away from me?
 Reach your arms out.
 What do you need, Michael?
 "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  Im too shy to tell you that I love you."
 Thank you.
 I know, can you believe it?
 I guess thats why we have a temp, huh?
 How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
 Youve seen things cleaned before though, right?
 I dont know anything about that.
 Here?
 Sure.
  What are we doing at your parents house?
 I dont get it.
 I love it.
 Yeah, I love it!
 I mean, you bought me a house!
 You bought me a house!
 Um, do we have to sleep in your parents bedroom?
 And the clown?
 New chairs?
 Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
  Good? Yeah, he said good, Im good...
 Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
 Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
 Michael?
 Ive talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know theyre with me on this.
 What? Jim.
 Hey.
 So um, Ive been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
 I really think you should reconsider.
 Yeah, I know.
 But I really think you should reconsider.
 Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. Im not threatening you. I love you.  But you should know, youre on very dangerous ground .  All right.
 Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
 Well that never happened.
 So, I guess thats how theyre gonna play this. It is on.  It is so on.
 Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years Ive had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
 Aww.
 Thats cool.  Mm, good stuff.
 Thank you.
 Michael?
 Hey!
 You got a second?
 Oh, good.
 Oh, that mustve been so fun.
 Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
 Yeah, is that a new tie?
 That is amazing!
 What?
 No.
  No way!
 Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
 Yeah.
 Heres what I was thinking everyone sits on a chair every day...
 But not everyone...
 Or even uses the copier every day.
 Yeah, right?
 ...Thats it.
 All right, see you later...
 Hot tie guy.
 No, copiers great.
 Yeah. I have my copies.
 And I have my original.
 So suck it.
 Theres that ass!
 Woo! Yeah. Aw, dont take it away!
 Did somebody call Hank?
 You can try mine.
 Yeah, know what?
 You can do that?
 Youre gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
 Or chairs?
 So whats it gonna be?
 Let me just say, youve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
 Hey.
 Thanks Michael.
 Yeah, I guess, since I won.
 I wish that youd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
 I know.  If she wasnt an alcoholic before, she is now.
 I knew it.
 I knew some of it.
 Its Christmas.
 Thank you. I knew it.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Im sorry, hes not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
 Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. Its actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
 Quick announcement new year, new candy.
 Okay, be careful, Kevin. Theyre kind of spicy.
 Yeah.
 So, maybe just try one at first, and then if its okay, have a couple more...
 Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
 Of course you will.
 Oh my God!
 Have you seen her with her bangs?
  Kevin!
 Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We dont even give him full internet access.
 No, because...
 Hillary swank.
  Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
 The phones are dead.
 Try a different door.
 What do we do?
 We dont normally download films illegally.  Because were honest,  hardworking people.
 But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
 My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jims been great. But Im gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
 Hes not saying what he needs to say.
 Yeah.
 Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
 So he doesnt share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughters fiance?
 Hey.
 Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
||
 I dunno. I mean, maybe hell talk to you about some of this stuff cause he cant really talk to me about it.
 Youre good to talk to.
 What?  Oh...
 Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
 What did you say to my dad?
 After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
 What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
 Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  Hes supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
 Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!
 Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, Im sorry, Michaels not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
 I think he meant personal day.
 Phyllis theres a package for you.
  Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah Ill see ya then.
 Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, youve never doubted for a second that Im the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess hes never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
 Yeah.
  When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.
 Michael! Its really good to see you.
 What?
 Ugh.
 Good morning.
 He brought a sled.
 Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
 Separate rooms.
 Im going to say it anyway.
 This is a new cardigan.
 No.
 Can I turn on the radio?
 But then you fall asleep and theres nothing for me to do.
 Thats dangerous.
 Thats okay I can... Im fine. Ill just play a song in my head.
 No, that was a long time ago.
 No, Im not even wearing that much.
 I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldnt hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
  Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
 Stop it, please.
 Please cut it out.
 Michael!
 No its not.
 So when are you due?
 Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
 Oh, hes cute.
 What is happening there?
 Its really sweet.
 Uh, theyre good. Uh, Jims good. Were engaged.
 Thank you.
 I like her.
 Im serious. Um, Im really glad I came.
 Because, um, cause Ill never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. Shes happy and, I dont know, it feels good.
 Are you asleep?
 No, remind me.
 Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly.
 Okay, lets go.
 Yeah, screw em. Lets do this.
 Were engaged.
 Oh, wow, thank you!
 ... Okay, lets go.
 So, detour. Were now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I dont think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!   Ive been driving too long.
  Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
 You look good.
 Im so sorry, Michael.
 Shes not doing it to hurt you.
 Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didnt want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
 You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then shell realize what shes missing.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Maybe. One step at a time.
 You can do this.
 Oh, God.
 Michael, get off the floor!
  No, no, no, you have to do it-
 That was weird, huh? Its all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  Im just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that Im going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor youre gonna get. Forrest Gump.
  Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Hollys boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw!  Cutting down the competition.
  Dont look up. Dont look up.
 No.
 What?
 Oh, Michael...
 You did what?
 She never sent it to you?
 No.
 No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. Its a violation of her trust.
 Because, she didnt send it to you!
 I could read it.
 Yeah, I could read it.
 Go get your laptop.
  What? Im not in love with her.
  Its deleted.
 She still has feelings for you.
 I cant tell you specifically, but... its not over.
||
 No, we dont need to do that.
 You mean Tony?
 Oh, Michael.
 Good morning, can I help you?
 Im sorry, hes not in right now.
 Shoot.
 They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But Id like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.  Vending machine.
 That is a great idea.
  Um, oh boy, lets see, hes really...
 There he is!
 Ayyyy!
 That was funny.
 This is our first and only Valentines Day as fiances.
 Really, Jim?  On Cupids birthday?
 I cant see them when theyre on the floor
 You cant be a part of our relationship, Michael.
 What do you think?
 Were in.
| Anything to get out of that office.	|
 Wow,  thats impressive.
 What?
 Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
 Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
 No, you just have little dainty fingers.
 Whats the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
 Oh, damn.  Theyve been in there for like ten minutes.
 Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
  What?
 Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
 Do you think they dined and dashed?
 I thought we were having a nice time.
 Yeah.
  Mine too.
 My God.
 Yep, that, yeah.
  Yeah, thats no problem.
  Sure. Uh huh.
 Im on the phone.
  You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye.  It really makes us look unprofessional.
  Whos there?
 Buddha who?
 Great.
 Now theres, theres butter on my desk.
  Good morning, Michael.
 Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
 Jelly beans.
 You dont have to wait that long. I mean, you dont have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
 Thats psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David.  No, Im sorry hes not back from the Civil Rights rally. Ill have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
 When Michaels skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. Stopping a fight in the parking lot.  An Obama fashion show.  Whatever... that is. Or trapped in an oil painting. Im gonna save that one.
 Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. Hes having a colonoscopy. Alright, Ill find out if hes out yet.
 I dont think Jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her.
  Shush.  Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and its really romantic.
  Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
 Sure.
 Its actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
 OK.
  Not classy.
  Hi, can I help you?
  Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
  Michael, theres a Charles Miner here to see you.
  Yeah, are you coming out now?
  This is what you did last night?
  He just had to wear his tux today.
  Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
   Uh, hi, can I help you? I dont think anyone here-
  Oh no.
  I can tell Michaels mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
  And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
  Cupcake. Its cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
  Its really just a regular shaped cake.
  He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
  Okay focus. Focus.  Youre in the right building, youre with the right people; what happened?
  Do you have any leads on a job?
  Hi.
  Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. Itll be a few minutes.
  Hmm?
  Im working on it Kev.
  Itll be ready soon.
  Is that what soon means to you?
  Then come back soon.
  During the course of business, a copier goes though something called Normal wear and tear.
  Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didnt set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.
  No, Im sure theyre pretty much the same as the English instructions.
  Thats a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
  Hmm...
  Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
  Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  Cause its a pretty big risk.
  Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
  Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
  Yeah. Good.
  Mmm-hmm
  Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment youve all been waiting for. Right?
  Meredith...   Oh... so uh... G-44.  Its not ready Kevin!
  Im at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
  Hows it working?
  Good.
  I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
   Michael?
  Oh no.
  Im going with him.
  Im going.
  Michael, wait!  Im coming with you.
  Yeah.
  Great. Uh, except, I dont want to be a receptionist anymore.
  Salesman.
  Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
  Probably.
  Okay, see you later.
 Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And were starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.  Look, its official!
 Michael, you were expecting me, right?
 Are you wearing anything under the robe?
 This looks great, Michael.
 Yes, please.
 ... Square is fine.
 So, what do you say we get started?
 Im full.
 I feel good.  Wow.
 Yeah. Im excited to start the company.
 We did that. So, whats next? Michael, just stop for a second.  Michael. Stop for a second.
 No, I know you are.
 Just let me have... Oh.
 Fine!  Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry.
 You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
 I know! No, Im saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
 Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.  Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
 I think you should get dressed.
 Michael, that seems impossible.
 We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
 Great.
 No. What? Why?
 No. Were not gonna hire Ryan.
 Okay.
 Well find him.
 Really?
 We have an investor already?
 Michael, thats fantastic.
 Hey! We need to get you dressed!
 I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. Thats one thing Ive learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.  Hey! You look great!  Lets go!
 Next on the list - open the mail.
 No, okay. Its fine. Its fine. Were just gonna add "find office"...
 Next on the list --  song parodies.
 Great. Lets sing it in the car.
 Yeah.
 We can do this.
  We got Vikram!
 We have a meeting with an investor today.
 He can be.
 Hm. Im looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
 Yes. Yes, its possible.
 Michael! Whats going on?
 Hey, Ryan.
 This wasnt on the list.
 No.
 Its not.
  When did you add this to the list?
 You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
 No.
 What is he doing?
 Oh my God.
 Sorry!
 Sure.
 Beat.
  Nana?
 It means grandmother.
 I cant do this.
 I cant do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
 I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
 We dont have any money. We dont have an office. We dont have anything.
 How come out of everyone in the office, Im the only one that went with you? Is it because Im that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesnt even believe in you!
 Yeah.
 I could work here. I could see this.
 Are you good?
 Im good.
 Morning Michael!
 What should we do now?
 I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And its cold in there. Cause its technically a closet.
 That is so insulting.
 Because the thing youre saying Im good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
 Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
 Shut up!
 Really!
 Seriously? This is whats so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
 I dont want to look at your friend Jasmines boobs all day.
 Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
 Oh yeah I bet.
 Michael, we can hear you.
 Okay its my turn.
 Give it back for what? Whatre you gonna do with it?
 Youre gonna make another "spreadsheet."
 Yeah exactly. Its my turn.
 Come on! Ryan!
 Definitely.
 We could work from home.
  .... Corner idea?
 How would we know that?
 I thought that was your corner.
 So my corners the one with the copier?
 No thanks.
 Hey Im here to see Charles.
 Hey Charles.
 I know youre a very busy man so Ill cut right to the chase. Id like my old job back.
 Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
 Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
 Personal shopper?
 Well it was great catching up with you. And Ill see you around the building.
 Im just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if thats okay. The air smells so good. I dont remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
 Hey.
 Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
 Thats as specific as Id like to be.
 Were small, but were eager to make a name for ourselves.
 Nope, I dont have a card, but Ill do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
 Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well wed like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
 We already offered free delivery!
 Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
 A guarantee of what?
 And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
 I made a sale!
 Oh!
 Things are a little slow here. And theres only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out theres no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someones face.
 Were getting pretty good at it.
 The timelines messy.
 Im confused. Am I walking down the aisle to You Can Call Me Al?
 I dont know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
 Mm-hmm.
 Im not gonna do that.
 Im here. Im a part of this now.
 Michael, are you alright?
 Tell us what youre talking about.
 We cant help you if you dont just tell us what happened.
 Michael!
 I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
  Sounds neat.
 Oh my God, I think weve been robbed!
 We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says "Alleluia Church of Scranton." in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
 You didnt happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
 Oh, awesome.  Youre a life saver.   Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
 Do you drink this every day?
  Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  Its, uh, its a paper company now.  Its not for the church.
 Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
 Yeah, I know what a loft is.
 Corporate greed?
 Did it help?
 When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You dont blame the child.  He didnt know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid.  I trust you."
 We have maybe a month.  I dont know what Im gonna do.
 Thats what Michael said.
 I like it.
 Steve Martins not dead, Michael.
 You want to hear something sad?
 So Jim and I are getting married and the weddings really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
 Really?
 Seriously?  Are you being serious?
 Yes.
 Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
 No, Michael.
 We have to come from a position of strength.
 Mm-hmm.
 $60,000.
 Are you kidding me?
 Can you give us another minute please?
 Michael.
 Why are you assuming youd get the whole thing?
 No, Michaels right.  Jobs are safer.
 Agreed.  But thats all, okay.
 Thank you.
 Thats right.
 Alright!
  Who is it?
    Boscovs at the Steamtown Mall?
 Well, you have good taste.
 What?
  Oh, I, um...
 Thank, Michael.
 That ones great.
 What?
 Mm-hmmm.
  We were something else.
 Mmm.
  You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  Its okay, Ryan.
 He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  Hell make his decision by the end of the day.
 Oh.  I think you should get it.  Youve changed a lot and youd be good at it.
 Yeah.
   Just tell me.
 No, okay.
 Okay, I get it.  Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?   Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
 I did?
 For real, youre not kidding?
 I did?
 Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
 Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
  Oh.  I really thought I didnt get it.
 Yeah.  Cause you said I didnt
 What about Ryan?
 Yeah.  Maybe you shouldnt fake fire people anymore.
 Thanks, Michael.
 Erin.
  Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
 Not cool, Dwight.
 Oh, I cant do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
 Just sent it.
 If you dont take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
 Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
 So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
 Were getting married today.
 Tell em how it happened.
 And very expensive.
 You cant leave anyone out.
 Ok, just get to the good part.
 I had just woken up. I didnt look cute. Thats how I knew he meant it.
 What?
 Theyre beautiful.
 Yeah.
 This is so cheesy.
 I like cheesy.
 Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding.
 Really?
  I can do it.
 You had to be there.
 Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
 Okay.
 Oh, dont get us wrong, we like picnics.
 Tell them what happened last year.
 No, no, that guy who hit on me.
 Yeah, you dont grab these  for balance.
 Hey Charles.
 Do you want me to beat him up for you?
 Back off, Dwight.  Hyuh!  What?
 Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
  Hyuh!  Well, look at that, we win!
 Good game!
 How do you figure?
 Lets do this.
  I got it!
  Oof!
 Yep. No, no, no, Im fine.
 Yeah.
 No, no, its fine. Just gimme a second.
 Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, lets go, its our ball. Lets go!
 Well be back!
 How long will that take?
 Im sorry, can we just hurry this up? Ive got a game to get back to.
  This is the last day of our summer interns. Its been nice. We havent had interns for a while, ever since Michaels Monica Lewinsky incident.  He didnt do anything sexual.  He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes.  It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
 Nobody.
  We havent told anyone Im pregnant.
 Yeah, we dont want them at the wedding thinking Jims being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
 Nope.
 Cant back out now, Halpert.
 No, keep it up.
 Just keep it to yourself then.
 What?
 Why did that come into your brain?
 Who did you tell?
 Nobody!
 Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Lets pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
  Michael?  Hes over here!
  Where are you going?
 Dont get on it.
 Dont... get... on. Do not.
 Step away.
 Jim.
 Stop. Dont. Just...
 Yes.
 Okay.
  Its clear why we were trying not to tell people. Thats clear now.
  Youre right. We shouldve realized that you are an equal part of this.
  You called Stanleys wife?
 If you talk to her, youre gonna tell her about Stanley, and thats gonna seem more suspicious.
 Michael, please dont.
   Hey, Good luck.
   Okay, its just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
   Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
    Ummm, I dont know.
   Did I?  Doesnt sound like me, not very superstitious.
   Please dont talk about my breast milk.
   Yeah.
   Hey Kelly.
   Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
   I dont know, he hasnt RSVPd yet.
   We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.   Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls.   Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
   Hey Ryan.
   So, I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding.
   It costs about $75 per person.
   Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not?
   Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
   Kelly Kapoor, yes.
   Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
   Well, you have to choose a food option and theres information in there about directions and lodging...
   You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
   To ask for directions..
    And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
   So rude, right?
    Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  Its incredible.
 I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, Im also pregnant.
 We did, but mostly because people expect us to. Were also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
 Its awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesnt Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
 Oh, good.
 No, were not.
 I dont think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Is this what Ive become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" Thats the first time Ive seen it in writing!
 Why arent there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
 Jim?
 Yeah, I mean, if its all the same for you.
 $100 now for sure.
 Yeah. No, no, Ill um-- the hundred. Ill just take the hundred.
 How sure is this?
 The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
 Im sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
 Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
 I dont think Im asking for too much. I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
 Yeah, but arent you supposed to do that to our... no. Its great.
 Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
 Well, were thinking of my grandmother who we havent told and is very old-fashioned.
 You know, Angela, you dont have to come to the wedding.
 Next time were all in this room Jim and I will be married.
 Thank you, Dwight.
 See you later.
  Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
 She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
 Yeah.
 Oh.
 We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
 Can we take a look at the suite now?
 Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
 Im gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
 Oh, Mema? Shes the one in the teal suit. Shes the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
 Hey, Mema.
 Oh. Thank you... but nobodys perfect.
 Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. Shes also my maid of honor.
 Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
 She has a boyfriend. Hes out of town.
 Like... a year.
 Michael.
 Michael. Stop.
 Mema.
 Hey, smooth guys.
 Memas not coming to the wedding. Shes leaving tomorrow morning.
 I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
 I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
  Nevermind.
 Yeah.
 No.
 What?
 Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
  Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
 He tore his scrotum dancing.
 He is in my room icing his balls.
 Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
  Your brothers took you out drinking?
 Thats Michael.  Youre out with Michael?
 Okay, fine.  Ill take him.
 Are you pushing me off the phone?
 Goodbye.
  Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
  Look, Im not the one who asked you to do a split when youve never done one before.
 My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  Thats my job.
 Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
 Thank you weirdo.
  Okay, here I come.
  Thanks mom.
  He does.
  Yes. Thank you, mom.
 Okay great.   Yeah, Ill see you in a second.   Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no!
 Can you come here please?
 No.  No, but Im allowing it.  Just come here.
 Hey.
 Terrible.
 My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and Im five months pregnant that Im not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
  Thank you.
  No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--
  Everyones driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andys scrotum.   And my mom wont stop freaking out about my dads new girlfriend.   This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
  You look great.
  Mm-hmm.
  Yes I did.
   Go ahead.  I think its your turn.
  Yeah, Im okay.
 Saw it.
 Hey Oscar.  Its Pam. Hey. Were on our honeymoon.
 Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
  Are you kidding me?
 Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really cant handle the fact that youre calling us here!
 Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
 It really was.
 Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
  Frank and beans!
 Hi, Michael.
 Some candy.
 Thats it.
 Its good to be home.
 Hey!
 Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
 Awesome! Ill leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
  I think itll be okay.
 Great.
 Frank and beans!  So whatd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
 Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we?
 Come on, itll take two seconds.
||
 Wow, Botticellis, that sounds like a special occasion.
  I dont know. I think Michael has a date.
  I think you have a date.
 Come on.
 Oh, thats too bad.
 Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
 Of course.
 Oh.
 Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
 No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
||
  How could you do this to me? Hes my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
 Thank you.
 You need to be more upset about this. Shes your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
  Haha!  Ha ha ha.
  I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.
  I love it, conservation.  Lets start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.     No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!
  Im not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
  Dont call my mother your lover.
  Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
  Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
  Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybodys mom...
  Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
  You are never going to be my father, you get out!
  Me too...
  Hey.
  Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
  Well, he could still... Im sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
  Sure, whats up?
   Whats the matter, you cant fight your own battles?
   Oh, would that make you feel better?
  You can tell Michael that Im not leaving.
  Michael, youre just her rebound!
   What!  You knew?
  Mmmmm, yes!
  Then whyd you even offer!?
  Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
  Whats that supposed to mean?
  Shut it!
    Awww, he did that for me?
  Mmmm.
  Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.
  Maybe Im overreacting.
  But I dont think I am.
 Here we are outside-
 - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
 The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
 Here it is.  Suite 401.
 I know. Now you dont have to.
  Oh. No, no.  Were not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
 And wed like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
 Its ok.
 Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
 Yeah.
 You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
 You blew the sale, you idiot.
 Oh-  Thank you.
 Well, you know.
 He loves to eat.
 I love to watch him dance.
 And Ill just watch him.
 Yes.
 Mmm-hmm.
 It was, sweetie.
 Yeah, well, thatll happen.
 Sometimes were so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
 Yeah, I guess.
 If Im being completely honest, I couldve done without the belly kiss.
 Yeah. Way too much.
 I mean, what the hell was that?
 When you cried?
 Youre fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
 Hmm.
 Well, are you dating anyone?
 Ah.
 Ah.
 Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
 Ok.
 Mmm-hmm.
 No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. Hes really cool.
 Yeah, he is.
 Thats... right. Hes like Marlon Brando.
 I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
 Oh, no thank you.
  I have an early lunch.
  Michaels been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I dont know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today hes planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
 Hey!   Hey. Happy birthday.
  I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
  Kevin!
 Yes, lets go.
 Oh, you guys.  Just one second.   Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I dont think I can go to lunch.
  I know.  Isnt that always how it goes?
 I want to handle it.
  I feel like its--
  Yeah-- its exciting.
  Thank you.
  Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didnt even blow it.
  I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
  Michael, you did all this?
 So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
 49 again? Thats nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
  Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
 Please be Grandma.
  I want you to be Grandma.
  Yay, Grandma!
 Maybe.
 What about your gift Michael?
  He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
 Aww--
 Thats amazing.
 Yeah.
  Thats really nice Michael.
  Home run Michael.
 Hey. Whered you go?
  And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
 Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  Its time for cake.
  Cakes really good.
  Michael.  Michael ,its okay.
  I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
 Well--
 Michael.
 What?
 I am working.
 Really?
 Really?
 Why?
  I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
  I have the worst attitude of any person here.
  Yeah, Ill take it.
  Youre bribing me?
  I want to hit you.
  I want to hit you.  Ill do that.
 No.  Are you kidding?
  No.  I dont think I can hit you in the office.
  So, um... well do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  Im going to hit you as hard as I can.
 Okay.
 See you then.
 Oh...
  Right.
 Okay.
  Okay wait-- its-- youre saying it comes from the foot.
 Okay.
 Wow!
  Are you ready?
  You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
 Michael, you have to put your hands down.
  What are you sorry for?
  How about for dating my mom?
  And dumping her on her birthday.
  Okay-- just-- dont ever date a member of my family again.
  Are you okay?
  Youre okay.
 No.  You were right.
  Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
  Who are you?
  Ill go.     My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
  Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than Id hurt a June bug.
  I do not.
  I think Michael may have snapped.
  Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
  Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  Im trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I cant think of one.
  I should just go.    Where to now Caleb?
    Whats the news?
   It wasnt me.  Im not goin down for this!
  Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.
 Oh my God, you guys, look. Its Recyclops.
 The thing I like most about Recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child.
 A world where you truly can be anything you want.
 Thats great.
 Sure.
 Dont do the twirl.
 Stuff gets around. I dont participate.
 I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
 Can you actually fire people?
 Well, I cant really imagine you yelling at anyone.
 Oh. Ok. Ive heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, Hey, look. We parked over here!.
 Well, youll figure it out.
  Looks great.
 Okay.   The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
 Michael, why did you promise that?
 No Michael, why would you promise that?
 Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing youve done.
 Its terrible.
 Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse its going to get.
 No!
 You have to tell them.
 Its fine.  Erin, youre going to go.  And youre going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
  Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesnt Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and well move on.
 Thank you.
 No, wait, come on.  I didnt miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
 Yup.
 Ah!
 Is it, is it fake?
 So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
 You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if its a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
 Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.   I think my water just broke!
 Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
 Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
 Have you talked to him?
 Matt?
 Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
 Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
 Oscars pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
 Okay.
 Yes! Theyre the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
 How could we do what?
 Twelve drummers drumming.
 Hello.
 Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
 It might seem crazy, but since theres no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflins highest ranking employee. So, thats where we are.
 For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
 Good to meet you.
 Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
  Yep, yep.
 Yep.
 Yes.
 Oh, Michael.
 No, dont!
 What do you want us to do?
 Because were usually not on the same page.
 Hey.
 Oh, you mapquested it. Its four blocks away.
 We found a great local daycare. Its rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means its also really hard to get into.
 Were hoping our interview seals the deal.
 Okay. Okay. Yeah.
 Theres a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
 What?
 Who? The -
 The guy were meeting with?
 Hi Jerry.
 Its lovely.
 Ok, youve got to pull it together.
 Hes uncomfortable because youre acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
 Thats the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
 Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
 Maybe, because it doesnt seem to be going super well.
 Nope. Cause were really nice people but you dont seem to like us.
 So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
  Oh, Michael marked his heights. Hes grown!
 Michael, stop.
 Michael...
  He looks happy.
   I just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, Im pregnant...  Great, well, Ill write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
  There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
  Kevin, youre such a gourmand.
  Hmm.
  Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
  No, no.  I still have time.
  Im having contractions, but theyre irregular and far apart.  So Im not really in labor, Im near labor.
  If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
  I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
  Ooh.
  You know the babys not going to live here, right?
  Okay, okay, were not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
  Everythings fine.  We have plenty of time.
  Hold on, hold on.  It isnt midnight yet.
  No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
  Im going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
  Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
  Five minutes apart.
  Okay, stop watching me.
  Mm-hmm.
  Not until midnight.
  Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I dont think Im going to make it until midnight if Im just sitting here thinking about it.
  Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
  Oh, thanks, Kelly.
  Yes, this is the only time Im ever going to make this request.
  Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
  Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but youre really distracting me from my distractions.
  Why dont you go do some work?
  I know, you dont like to be frazzled.
  Okay.
  Hey.  Im not going to get in the car, because I know if I do youll try to drive me to the hospital.
  Okay, Jim.
  Everything is fine.  You dont have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  Shes not coming out for a while, okay?
  I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldnt wait...  Oh, God, dont be mad.
  Mm-hmm.
  I know.
  Good.
  Okay.
  Oh, yeah, my water broke.
    Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
  No, not yet, Michael.
  Oh, wow, its almost time for ultra feast!  Wheres Kevin?
  There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  Ill get there.  And if I dont get there, I dont get there.
  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Im fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said its still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
  Nope.  No, no, thats better.  That wasnt even the worst of them.  Im fine.
  Theyre not that bad still, babe.
  No, its passing, its fine.  Its okay.
  No, its passing, its fine.
  Ah, no, it passed.  Its good.
  Okay, Im not going.  Im not...  Its fine.    Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  Im not going today because I cant do it, I dont think I can do it.
  Oh, God.  Oh, no.
  Jim, we waited too long!
  I dont want to have my baby here.
  The hospital.
  A baby.
  Dwight, get away!
  Michael!
  Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
  Wait, wait.  My iPods not in here!
  It has the birth song on it!
  Jim, I dont want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
  I dont know!  Lets go by the house and get it.  Its only twenty minutes past the hospital!
  Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think its on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
  Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen its under the...
  Dwight just listen!  Its underneath...
  Yes.
  No, Jim, stay!
  Okay.
  This is happening!
  Oh, my God.
    Shes incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
  Okay.
  Oh, thank God.  I havent had caffeine in nine months.
  Okay.
  Love you, mom.
  Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
  Again, no pants.
  Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
  Good.
  Doesnt she sleep here?
    Oh, big yawn.
  One, and then wrap around.  Its okay.  Hold that arm down.
  Shes not gonna...  Just...
  Go.
  I dont know.  I just, I cant tell if shes getting anything.
  Doesnt feel right.
  How does one do that?
  Do you want to try it, Jim?
  I cant tell if shes getting anything.  It just doesnt really feel right.
  Even if shes not getting anything?
  No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
  Shes just, shes really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
  Maybe itll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
  I know.
  Yes?
  Um, yeah, that would be great.
  So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
  Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I cant tell if Im really producing.  I dont know if shes getting anything.
  Okay.
  Okay.
  No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
  No.  It just feels like pressure.
  Okay.  So, Im just not sure if Im releasing, though.  Im not sure if...
  Okay.  Aw, thank you.
  Okay.
  Oh, shoot.
  Shoot, she fell off.
  Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
  Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think itd be weird if you did it.
    Jim, Jim, get her.
  Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
  I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
  Oh, my God.  I didnt even have to do the "C thing."
  Aw, were doing it.
  Were really parents now.
  Oh, hey, Isabelle.
  Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but shes totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I dont want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
  Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
  Oh, my gosh.
  No, not at all.
  Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she wont latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
  Okay, please hurry.
  Oh, yeah, sorry.
  Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
  Hi.  We did it.
  I used a variation of your move.
 Its kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that shes very ironic.
  Hey baby, whats up?
 Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
 He means his mopey place, its under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
 Yes! Yes! I would love to!
 Its been so long since Ive been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanleys going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
I want her to meet Michael.
Theyre both single, I have a sense they might-
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Hey, how are you?
Aw!
Yeah!
Hey, Michael.
This is my friend Julie.
Julie laughs at everything.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
You want to play pool?
Ok.
Hey, Michael, where have you been?
Why are you wearing a hat now?
Maybe.
Maybe it should come from a man.
Hey, Michael, why dont you just get down.
Ok, um, why dont we just finish the game? Michael, its your shot.
You guys are stripes, I think...
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Really?
Im sorry, hes not usually like that.
Hes more, just... like... you can go.
Okay. Bye.
Yeah.
Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Okay, we have to get home.
Not at all.
 Hey, thanks.
 Its my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
  Oh. You couldnt have watered it?
 Its nice to see you again, Dwight.
  Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
 No, no, hes right.
 Thats weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
 You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
 Mm.  Meredith!
 What are you doing?!
 Relax?!
 Give it back to me now.
 Its disgusting!
 Its not sterile!
 Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
 No, no never.
  "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful."
 What? What do you mean, suspend me?
 Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
 Yeah. And he worked here too.
 No, no it wasnt Andy. It wasnt. It doesnt matter. Its not about who youve been with. Its about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
 Thank you.
  Hey Toby.
 Very interesting.
  Thanks Toby.
 I dont think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
 Yeah. "I vant to count to ten".
 That would have been funny.
 You know, maybe theres an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like,  "I just delivered a baby. They didnt offer me a guarantee."
 This is our first joint sales pitch. I think were gonna work really well together.
 We have good give and take.  I give, he takes.
  Yee.
 Oh, no were actually married. Were not brother and sister.
 Ill have one.
 Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldnt still be here.
 What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
 Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
 Who cares?  Its not that huge a sale.
 Dont act like you understood anything that guy said.  Good luck, wingman.
 Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
 You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
 I was after your money.
 Yes, it was.
 Hmm?
 Um... I think its really, really unlikely.
 Really unlikely. But I cant say that its impossible.
 Im not saying shes in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
 Hey, Michael.  How you doing?
 You know what, Michael? For what its worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
 Michael...
 She doesnt want you to return the barrette. Shes not interested in you.
 Im sorry.
 Michael!
 It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight."
 Stanley got to go.
 No, Michael, no.
 You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
 That is right. Dont make any more of it.
 How what?
 You could start by concluding this meeting.
 Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
 Amok. It means, dont let your imagination run out of control.
 Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
 Oh!...
 Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
 No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
 Michael. Okay, Im... Im going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
 Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
 And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship youre in.
 Helene.
 My mother.
 My mother, Helene.
 Hmm? Oh. Its probably nothing.
 Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasnt Michael.
 No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
 So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  Its Cece.  Shes never gonna do anything wrong.
 Hey, Michael.
 Im sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
 I lied its personal. Its about me and Jim. Were... I just... youre the only person I can talk to.
 And...
 No, not... were not... were not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
 Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
  I need you to sign this! So bad!
 I love ... this idea is neat. Ive never been. It sounds lovely.
  Youre gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing.  Are you a golfer?
 Absolutely.
 I dont know who he is.
 What?
 You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
 You have to settle down first.
 Okay. Okay. Yes.
 Yeah, but you have to calm...
 Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
  Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
  Did she see me?
  What flavors did you get?
   Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
  No, no, no, its fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open em up.
  Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so were just trying to get out in front of this.
   Yeah, or no... well... I dont know. Im sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise Id be running this.
  And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
  Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he gets like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you dont know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
  No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
  Leave!
  Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
  Thats awesome. You want some ice cream?
  Could he still be seeing her?
  Me too!
  Hey Michael.
  We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
  We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
  Yes.
   Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
  Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
  You were supposed to be the Lookout.
  So embarrassing.
  We will be well-rested tomorrow.
  I dont think those were yours to take.
  Did you talk to him?
  You talked to the man whose wife youre having an affair with.
  I dont think Im gonna make it.
   It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
  Well, it does and it doesnt.
  You sleep in the warehouse?
  Okay.
 It was me.
 Okay. Im talking to this woman at daycare...
 Shes telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
 Her husbands a reporter.
 So now everyone hates Andy, and its this whole mess, and I dont know what to do.
 I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
 I dont know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I dont want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
 That fast?
  Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what youre saying to me.
 Yeah, you didnt need to actually say it.
  I have never seen so many parking tickets.
 Um...
 Were not going for yogurt.
 Wouldnt we get fired for smashing all the computers?
 I dont think thats a good idea.
 Nobodys going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then well all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
 Yes, its totally obvious.
  Hey. What are you doing?
 Sorry.
 It was really funny.
 I love you.
 Why is there a circle with a line through it?
 Or enough for everyone?
 Get whatever you want, on me.
 I dont know. That usually works.
 I feel horrible for blowing Jims prank. I dont know if you can tell, but hes mildly upset. And Dwight hasnt been messed with in a while, so hes become a monster. I need to make this right.
 Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
 Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
 Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
 There we go.
 Lets just calm down.
 I dont-
 Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
 Dwight, what are you doing!? Weve only been in here for, like, two seconds!
 Youve gotta be kidding me.
 Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
 I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
 Well, you know... they dont call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
 They do call me that.
 Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, theres pee on the floor.
 Yeah.
 Stop drinking the water! Stop!
  We signed Cici up for this daycare. Its on the other side of town. The traffic...
  Were you painting in the dark?
  I dont really think we need...
  Yeah.
  And a soy sauce packet.
   Look, Im not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
  I cant do this. I dont have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
  Tell me Im good at sales.
  The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess thats fair.
  Yeah, what happened Dwight?
  So what happened?
   I am. I am the office administrator!
  Oh, were not interested. Were not interested at all.
  There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. Thats the main way. But this could work.
  A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isnt there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
  Thanks! Yeah, so Im just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
  I get paid $40,000 per year.
  Maybe $50,000.
  No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
  I liked them.
  Hey, do you have a second?
  Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, Ive been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
  And, I havent gotten paid yet. Im not blaming you.
  I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
  Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
  Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to...
  There are a lot of one person departments here, so, theres a lot of department heads. But Im off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
  We can do that.
  Easily.
  But of course!
  So weird that there is no paperwork.
  Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
  Admit what?
  Say it.
  Say that Im lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
  Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
  Sure. Anything else?
 Ill get it right away.
  The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 200 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
 Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. Im really sorry.
 Well keep looking.
 I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
 Yeah.
 Hey, Erin, its Pam. How ya doing? No, no, dont put Cece on the phone, because she cant talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everythings going. Yeah? Yeah? Its good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, its fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, hes really sorry you couldnt make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. Were having a great time. Oh, theyre flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everythings fine!
 We can relax.
 Sounds like Cece.
  Oh, my God! Go, go!
 Why are you here?
 What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I dont... you know, babies shouldnt have ice cream, by the way.
 You know what? It doesnt matter. It doesnt matter.
 Okay.
 Not together!
 This night was a disaster.
 Yeah?
 Get it.
 Lets get our juice on.
 No. No no no!
  Yes!
 Yeah, go away.
 What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
 Its just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
 Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really dont know what that is.
 Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
 Andy thats way too personal of a question.
 Okay.
  Michael!
 Come on, Michael! Yeah!
 Not the car!
 Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
 Thats fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
 No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right?
 You dont look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
 You dont?
 Not really. Its kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
  Bye, Stanley! Love you!
 People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe youve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
 What?
 Im supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when Im standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesnt want to put his costume on.
 We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
 Except where Juliet doesnt have that great a time and Romeo doesnt call back after two dates.
 But Ive learned to love again.  Hes a cartoon sailor.
 And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
  Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
 Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! Its not even a history.
 It was two.
 No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I dont know, you never called me back, so...
 Yeah?  It was though, thats what happened.
 Hmm-mm.
 Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you cant vote for yourself.
 Michael, this is a bad idea.
 Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
 Angela as the nurse!
 Id remember talking about Jim. That wasnt it.
 I did. And its just one of those things thats going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didnt he? I have no idea why."
 Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?  Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
 Oh, wow!
 Aww, my hero!
 Okay, everyone, Ive tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
 I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. Its that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, theyve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
 One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
 Oh, no, its just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.
 Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Dont come in if youre sick.
 And get your flu shot. Also, Im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
 Im not - Im not going to do that. Im not going to do that.
 Ceces getting christened today.
 Everyone from work is here. We werent planning on that.
 Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
 Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, Im so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know youre not Ceces godfather.
 Im sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. Im so sorry.
 Okay, thank you.
 Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
 No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. Theyre a great couple. You should meet them later.
 Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
  Somebody needs a change.
 Well, she cant bring this up with her.
  What?
 Honey, no.
 No, no.
 We have an extra outfit in the bag.
 You said you checked it.
 Wow.
 We just had to add a few more tables. We werent expecting this many people.
 Nope, and were gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed em all.
  Hm. Dont listen to her. Shes just jealous cause she doesnt get to come home to someone as cute as you.
 I dont know. Im just hungry.
  Cece went down.
 Well, if it makes you feel better, I didnt get one either.
 Who the heck was that?
 We need more food. Ill go get some subs and sodas.
  Honey.
 Did you lose Cece?
 Shes up! Great!
 Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means Im up all day and Im up all night. And if it doesnt stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
  Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. Its closer to the TV. Itll seem louder.
 You have a gun in your desk?
 Maybe I should go.
 If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
 I cant even talk about it.
 I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
 Its a miracle. She loves him.
 No no no no no! Shell wake up!
 Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? Ive always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
 Absolutely!
 Do it!
 Jim, just dont think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
 What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
 Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
 No no no, dont. I will go talk to Angela.
 The reverse cycling ends tonight!
  Hey in there. Its Pam. Its not Dwight! Dont think its Dwight!
 I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
 Yes! I have been so authorized.
 Okay.
 You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
 Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
 Lord of the Ring stuff? I dont know, Im just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
 Youre typing "Big Boobs"?
 Mm-Hmm?
 Okay.
 Oh, its okay.
 Let it go.
 Yes, I invested in WUPHF. Its actually a great idea and I cant believe it didnt exist before. And I know Ryans kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. Ive done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
 What do you want to say, Michael?
 Really?! Who?!
 Did you prank Dwight?
 Well, you like that.
 I love you, but Im kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
 Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
 Ryan, just tell us your plan.
 Oh, God!
 I move we sell!
 Sell.
 Hi, Michael.
 Oh, we dont recycle.
 Im sure no one asked you to do that.
 Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
 Michael, I...  I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that youve always felt with Ryan, where, like, youre best friends or youre his mentor or something?
 Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and hes taking advantage of you.
 And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
 Dont.
 Yeah, but in a jokey way where youre gonna start singing.
 Okay. Go Ahead.
 Do you mind?
 You dont have to do that.
 Are you okay, whats wrong?
 Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
 Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
 Im not going to do that.
 Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
 Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
 Sure.
  Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people hes worked with for years. His friends.
 An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
 Dwight take it down.
 Im serious, take it down or else.
 We can move out.
 So, does anyone wanna know where Ive been for the last 2 hours?
 I went out to look for a better office space.
 Not really, because I found one.
 Yup.
 Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
 Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you dont undo all the changes youve made, were moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
 Theyre not of Cece.
 This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
 Well, this building isnt far, and its much newer. Theres a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and its next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
 Koreans.
 White.
 Parley?
 So everyone here knows pirate code?
 Youve been watering down the soap?
 We need everything back the way it was.
 Thats a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed.
 Yeah?
 I know, because youre the reason were moving.
 Uhh, I think its something like umm...
 Umm, let me see.
 Oh, actually I dont know what I did with the one sheet. Yknow, thats the problem. You only have one sheet.
 Mmhmm.
 I lied about some aspects of the building.
 Theres no building... it doesnt exist.
 I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. Its just this Office Administrator thing, I dont wanna...
 Fail. I dont want to fail... again.
 And thats what you said about Art School, and thats what you said about sales.
 Well, Im not an artist, and Im not a salesman. So what would you call it?
 What?
 Well thanks.
 Hello, hello. Youre breaking the law.
 Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
 Okay lets go in. Im freezing.
 Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No ones putting this on their fridge.
 Okay.
 Im freezing.
 Im the office administrator now, which means Im basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
 It hardly looks fake. Its so lush.
 Great.
 Nope.
 Nashua got mp3 players.
 Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
 A party. Its not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
 Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
 Michael, Michael, wait we dont have, we dont have the budget for another party.
 I honestly think youre idealizing people here again, Michael. I dont think thats gonna happen.
 Hey.
 Yes. But dont get too excited, cause I didnt have a lot of time this year.
 Okay.
 Ive been working forever on Jims present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. Hell take a memory or a private joke, and hell create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes bear man. Wreaks havoc on the office. Its really good.
 No, it has the little...
 Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
 Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. Its just us.
 Oh, do you mean Darryl? Thats a great idea. Ill ask him.
 Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
 Cool.
 Hey, sorry, I really didnt want to come in. Its just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and were hoping we could borrow your truck.
 Okay. Sorry. Well uh, well leave you alone.
 Hey, how about this one?
 Maybe. I mean...
 Um, hey, Darryl, listen, its none of my business, but if I couldnt have Cece for Christmas, Id be really upset too.
 Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
 No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
 Bring her to the party. Yeah, well have Santa, and well play games with her. Itll be a lot of fun.
 Youll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
 Hey guys, the trees here.
 Who told you that?
 Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
 You guys, I dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
 Wow, an ultimatum.
 It doesnt really seem like you.
 So, cool right?
 Okay.
 Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
 I mean, help, if its something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
 No.
 Yup.
 No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
 Look at this.
 Jada, Darryl, Im so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
 Oh, my goodness.
 Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
 Thank you.
  I dont think hes in the ceiling, babe.
 Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?
  Oh, my God.
 I love it.
 Oh, um, its just, I didnt, I didnt have a lot of time, so thats just a place holder.
 Michael, wait!
 Thats good advice.
 Thats a sad story.
 Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everythings gonna be okay.
 I shouldnt tell you this, but... AJ wont commit to Holly. And shes gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose to her by the end of the year, its over.
 Really. And I dont know about you, but I dont know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
 So just be patient.
 Hey, sorry. Im ready.
 Oh... come on, bear man. Come on.
 Im sorry. I had no idea.
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
 What?
 What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God!  Honey? Jim? Jim!
 Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Years resolution on them, Ill collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
 Its gonna be fun.
 I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, shes awesome.
 Oh, hey, guys! Id like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Years resolution board.
 Hey, Dwight, Im collecting resolution cards.
 Why not?
 Learn to cook for one!
 Well, maybe youll meet someone.
 Angela.
 Make time for romance!
 I dont think so.
 No.
 Im not... Im not going to have...
 No! Just talk to her.
 Theres a plan.
 The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Whos been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
 Cool! Heres a little way to go gift from Sabre.
 Creed. I noticed you dont have a resolution on the board. Whats yours?
 How is it going?
 One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
 Yeah.
 But thats okay. Because its not about being perfect, its about trying.  In fact, why dont we go around and confess some of the ways that weve fudged on some of our resolutions?
 Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But thats fine.
 Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe Ill be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
 You dont have to do that, Kevin.
 Oh, Michael.
 Okay, Michael, just settle down.
 Kevin, dont! Come on!
 Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
 Okay, thats it.
  Lesson learned.
 Whats going on? Do you know that guy?
 "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
 I dont think thats a word.
 You want some help?
 Mm-hmm.
 K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
 No, it doesnt have to just be cow stuff, right?
 I think theres better...
 You could have just told us what you were thinking.
 Theres no yelling in that, either.
 Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
 I dont know. Theyre still in there.
 Stop. Out with it.
 Heres the story. That guy in there is Jims childhood friend, Tom.
 And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
 And Tom...
 And Jims mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
 Right. But howd you say it?
 Wait. Can you back up? Whats the story?
 Bye.
 Aw youll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game.
 All right, whatd you do?
 Whered you put it?
 Say it. Where?
 The fridge.
 The fridge, got it.
 Bye.
 This is Pam.
 Whats wrong?
 Jim, what?
 Oh God! What?!
 Ok. Shes ok?
 Understood.
 Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off?
 Alright, just call me after the doctor.
 Bye.
 Yeah.
 Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? Im not even kidding. Theyre pretty good.
 Well the first one has a surprise factor. "Im a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
 But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
 You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
 Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh, hey Dwight.
 No, he hasnt.
 No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
 Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time its convent, I just thought since you are out...
 Ok, well it wasnt obvious so...
 Ta-da!
 Yeah?
 Seriously?
 Oh! Ok.
 Guess not.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
 Hey. How you doing?
 Yeah.
 At least she lived a very long and Im sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When youre ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know were thinking about you.
 Its possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
 Im so sorry.
 How much did you give him?
 Wait. I dont have my scarf.
 Im missing my scarf. Oh.
  Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
 Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
 Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
 Yeah. What? Us?
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Thats weird. I mean, thats weird to have sex in the office. Thats where you work, right?
 You know, youre in a meeting, and nobody knows that youve had sex there, except for you and him.
 Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
 No, we werent.
 No.
 That was so embarrassing. Im gonna die.
 Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
 Besides, we have something those other people dont have, which is a home and a bed.
 No.
 We took a walk.
 Were all in it, from like years and years ago. Its like a home movie.
 Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didnt go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
 Wed love to see it!
 Okay everyone, I know were really excited to see this movie that everybodys in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so lets stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and well have a pure fun day! Okay?
 I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I dont wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right?
 Awwh, youre welcome.  My pleasure.
 I just helped someone out. It feels good.
 So you know the feeling.
  Hey, um...
 Hes seriously awful!
 United front...
 You have a computer Andy.
 Ok, but listen. We just dont have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
 Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
 See, this is what Im talking about.
 Sorry Andy.
  What the heck! Why do you have Erins computer!
 What? Erin is that true?
 Erin, its not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? Its not yours to give away.
 Im not freaking out, Andy.
 Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
 Switch the computers back Andy.
 Seriously.
 Now please.
 I dont know if theres really a private place in this office.
  You did that?
 Okay.  When did people sign-
 Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
 Okay, well I didnt think about it like that. Its just, I cant do anything about it. I cant replace that one unless that computer breaks.
 Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
  So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
 Andy, this is the deal we made.
 We should break this hinge maybe.
 Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
 Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.
 Yep. Lucked out.
 Yep, super lucky.
  Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
 Three.
 Im full on corrupt!
 Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
 Oh.
 Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didnt need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
 Its cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
 The signs will drive people inside.
 Oh, which one is decaf?
  Michael! Michael!
 Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
 Why do you need more gas?
 Is it a good message or a bad message?
 Are you proposing!?
 Wow.
 Yea. Yea no problem.
 Yep.
 Michael, youve had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
 This is terrible.
 You know what? Im gonna get a hose. Then well talk about it. Ok well figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
 Hey Michael everyones in the conference room.
 You called the meeting I dont..
 Michael.
 We are a family.
 And Ive always believed that we should all be involved in everyones personal lives, in a very major way.
 So about this proposal thing...
 Michael, shes perfect for you.
 So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that its safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
 Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didnt you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
 Holy s*** is that real?
 No shes going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
 No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
 Shes not gonna say no.
 You were scared?
 Congratulations!
 Well, it wasnt an affair.
 But, no, but we are a family.
 Cecelia.
 Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.
 Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
 Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
 Da-das.
 See, we knew it! If he just met her, hed understand.
 Whats going on?
 Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
 Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
 Youre right, youre right. Im a middle class broad.
 Yeah...  Hey, Erin, everything okay?
 Whats wrong?
 Why dont you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
 Dont you think its better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
 What?
 Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you dont love him. Just be honest with him.
 You didnt think to mention me huh?
  Why?
 Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
 Lets grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.
 In costumes!
 Whats wrong with cupcakes?
 Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
 We thought.
 So this is the dream team.
  Okay.
 Should we get toppings?
  What?
 Hot fudge?
  You should do more stuff like that.
 So Im going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
 Its a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
 Its not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
 I dont think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
  So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
 I dont, I dont think we sh-
  Okay, dont turn this into some feminist issue.
 You know what, I think we should get some other input.
 Oh, hey Michael! Im just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. Ill see you later.
||
  No he wasnt sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an awards member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
 Good morning, Deangelo.
 Okay.
 Because of the flowers.
 Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
 Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.    Shes got great experience.  We even considered making her Ceces godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but heres her resume.
 Okay.
 Oh my God, he hates me!
 I know.
 Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
 Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
 Oh wow, you werent kidding.
  Look.  Im juggling eggs and bowling balls.  Im juggling with one hand.  No hands.
 What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
  Why dont you talk to him about it?
 Why dont you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
 So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
 So, umm, is this your first office job then?
 Wow.
 Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
  Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
 So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
  Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but its really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
 Okay, well its just really loud.
 Youre back in.
 We could get Deangelo flowers.
 What have you done?
 Cant stay there all day.
 Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
 Stop stalling! Come on.
 You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
 Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
 Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
 Dwight, no gun, okay? Dont make us call Jo.
 You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
 You shot a gun off -
  What are we doing?
  We need a new manager.
   Should you really be so blatant about that?
  Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
   Its gorgeous, Angela.
   Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
  Thats not accurate.
  How is this on me?
  Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there were at least seven.
  Theyre the same picture.
  The Senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid.
  And dont say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
  Did you see him at a bathhouse?
  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
  Forget it. Im never gonna know what goes on there.
  Youre in the gay mafia.
  No.
  Im a woman. I would want to know.
  She does seem happy.
  Okay.
  Uh, just put him through to me.
  Hello! This is... the client.
  Yes.
  Great.
  Thank you, bye-bye.
  That was our dream wedding.
   I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
  A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
  No, I want you to say that you think the best person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
  Ohh, hey Gabe, Im sorry, we... we didnt get you a cake or anything. Were gonna miss you.
   Is that right?
  Well, okay!
 I dont think I should.
 Right here. Little Michael Scott-
 Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
 Wait, when did we start calling it that-
 Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
 Because everything makes me cry, so whats the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
 Not enough though.
 Jim.
 If he comes out, distract him.
 He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
 Maybe its a list of people hes gonna fire.
 â€˜Scuse me?
 I love you so much.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Thats regular pizza.
  Oh, text from Jim. â€œThis is getting very weird. Will explain later.â€
  Oh, text from Kevin.
 I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, â€œWhos that receptionist? I like her.â€ Now Im just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and youre like, â€œOh, loser.â€
 Oh. Oh God.
 Yeah, Im fine.
 Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
 Okay, I know Ive been crying easily today, but-  I mean, thats just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe its stupid. No.  Its wonderful. Im gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
  Yeah, I hate those endings.
 Oh! Text from Jim. â€œThis is...â€ hmm.
 Kevin, do you feel OK?
 Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
 No he hasnt.
 Kevin, at most youre saving a microscopic amount of time.
 Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
 Its huge.  How much does it weigh?
 Erin, you dont need to call him that.
 Parenting? Yeah. This is Cicis favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
 I flipped through it.
 Of course.
 Yeah.
 That sounds nice.
 I do.
 Who talked to Maggie at Kaufmans?
 Wheres Angela?
 Ready!  â€œIm not as think as you drunk I am!â€
 Do Not Resuscitate
 Oh, and then this was Phylliss idea So nasty Phyllis!
 We were hoping you could do something like this
 Baby.
 Yes.
 Um, what should we talk about?
 Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
 Angela, thats pretty transparently me.
 You know its just herbal tea.
 Yeah. I think you should call social services.
 You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like were in this together.
 Fine.
 I dont like that clip.
 Whats that come to? Like, what did they each win?
 Awesome.
 And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
 I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
 And then every morning, Id walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
 And then my handsome husband...
 Would bring me a flavored coffee.
 Well in your fantasy were Stephen King characters.
 Oh, thank you.
 Wait, wait. Whats this?
 It says â€œLotto Poolâ€, right on top.
 Oh come on. You really think Im gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
 No.
 Uh, buying lottery tickets online.
 You came in at 1030 today, right?
 So. Ive been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
 And we move to the south of France. See? No, theres plenty of bicycling for you. I think thats where they do the Tour de France.
 Because Im never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
 We came to an agreement. Were going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
 Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
 Just like now.
 Oh..
 What are you gonna do?
 Andy, somebody defaced it.
 Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
 How is that better than a barbecue?
 Nope.
 Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
 Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but dont, dont say anything, okay? Its after my grandfather.
  Oh, wow. Funny. Its after my grandfather.
 I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
 What are they doing?
 Nice touch.
 Yeah, she just went down.
 Aww.
 Yes, after my grandfather.
 Well Im having my baby first, so thats that.
 You think your doctors going to give you a C-section at six months?
 Yeah.
  What are you doing?
 Oh.  Are you...
 Oh, Erin...
 Um, 2?
 No, I mean, youre doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
 Yeah.
 Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
 Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didnt believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, theres no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
 ...and he said, Thats what everyone sees, thats the Man In Black.
 Hey!
 What do you mean?
 I saw a ghost.
 It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
 I dont know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
  Pam Halpert.
 Is it called Ghostbusters?
 It didnt look like that.
 Ok fine Ill draw him.
 Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?
 Jim doesnt let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
 Really.
 Im not gonna freak her out, Jim.
 Im not gonna lie to her, either.
 Thank you.
 This isnt about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
 No, Creed.
 Lets see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means Ive heard Closing Time a hundred and five times.  Still dont know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
 I bet he went home.
 What are you doing?
 Uhm.
 Yeah, do you need a hand?
 Are you okay, Kevin?
 Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
 Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
 Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobodys nerfect, right?
 No. Its a jokey saying. Pobodys nerfect, like I cant even say those words right. Ha.
 You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
 Im thinking cow-
 Just dont talk about the email, okay? Hes gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
 Just trust me.
 I got this.
 Hahhh, thanks for everything.
  Dwight stopped the device!
 This could be real. Dwights pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
 You couldnt fix it.
 Yes you were.
 I dont think so, babe.
 Hey Cathy.
 Hows it going? Everything make sense?
 Great.
 Oh no, Im fine.
 Ok  Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
 Im training a temp to be my replacement while Im on maternity leave. Oh I shouldve mentioned Im pregnant. You probably didnt notice because its impossible to tell Im so small. But yeah Im pregnant.  Oh come on!
 You doubt it?
 Why do you doubt that shes single?
 Its going to be good to have someone hot at Pams desk huh?
 Im kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! Shes obviously super cute I get it. But Id like to point out theres 50 pounds more of me to love if thats your thing.
 Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
 Really well thank you all.
 Hey.
 Helen Mirren. Hot?
 Huh. What about Cathy?
 Yeah. Do you think shes hot?
 Im not asking if youre in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
 You dont find Cathy attractive?
 Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
 Yes, because shes hot, right?
 The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like youre a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly arent true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one whos telling me the truth.
 Dwight, am I hot right now?
 What about before? Was I attractive before?
 Hmm. I think Jims lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
 Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
 Yep, thats the Dwight I need.
 Okay.
 I think so. Okay.
 Well, what does that... is that... okay.
 Yep, good.
 Honesty is very important to me.
 Lets just see how we feel when we get there.
 Hmm.
 Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
 I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
 Mike Tibbets, really?
 Kelly, calm down.
 I dont think Jim cares about his hair.
 Jims on to me.
 Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
 Yep.
 No, Kelly, dont.
 Is he puffing out his chest?
 No. Maybe he just said something funny.
 I think hes just making her laugh.
 Whys he making her laugh so much?
 Why was he making her laugh so much?
 Oh, hey, Ill just be a second.
 Okay.
 Oscar, Cathy has a question!
  Yeah?
 Why wont you just admit that shes attractive? Its kind of annoying that you wont say it.
 Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe thats where we are now.
 Yeah, its nuts. But I dont know what else to do.
 This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
 Wait, thats it? Thats the question youre going to ask him?
 Ah, see, was that so hard?
 Really?
 Wait, what?
 Jim, you have high blood pressure.
 Doesnt your dad have high blood pressure?
 When was the last time you went to the doctor?
 Dwight, stop. Im not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
 Come on, lets go. I wanna call your doctor.
 Just go home. It doesnt matter.
  Im gonna do it.
 Oh! Im going into labor! Oh my goodness!
 I know its wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes its necessary.
  Im going into labor!
 Im going into labor!
 Im going into labor.
 Here we go!
 Okay.
 Oh! Oh!
 Im really in labor! This is happening!
 Oh!
 False alarm.
 Here. Like it?
 I cant get a fire pit. I have two babies.
 Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
 Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I dont like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
 Um, excuse me. Im gonna go to the bathroom.
 At this point, when youre this pregnant, its kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
 Hi. Wow, I really thought Id be more excited to be here.
 Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, its great to see you!
 Oh, hi Stanley.
 Jim.
 Hey.
 Hi everybody!
 How about a little visit?
 Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
 No, its the pacifiers turn.
  Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
 No, but that wouldve been a really good idea.
 No, she brought you drawings.
 She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No." Cece, do you want some broccoli?
 No. Its crazy.
 Shh.
 Oh, its okay, sweetie.
 Its okay, honey.  Its okay, its okay.
 Shh.
 Im looking, Im looking for the pacifier.
 Okay, were going.
 Shh, shh, shh.
 You want to grab her?
 Here we go, here we go.
 Jim.
 They dont hate you.
 When were you going go-karting with Darryl?
 Alright. Just dont worry, well figure this out.
 Ok, drama.
 Hey guys!
  Hi.
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
  Well, its not exactly a vacation.
 What?!
 Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevins allergic to walnuts. Youre allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
 Aw. Its OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
 When did you find time to do all this?
 Thank you.  Oh my gosh. Its really good.
 So you guys, you know whats an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
 ...we wanted to say thank you-
 Really?
 Ill fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
 Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
 Why? Does he think youre going to Florida?
 No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know its like wha-what?? Just do one.
 Well, lets hear it.
 I like it so far.
 Its perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
 Total golf text. Send it.
 Ok, read it back to me.
 Good. Doesnt sound pushy...youre just stating a fact.
 Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
 I think you need to go to Florida.
 Its only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house itll be..
 I was going to say good because Ill have all the help I need?
 Exactly.
 Alright
 Bye. Call me when you land.
 Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldnt the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
 There.
 Yeah?
 Well Im not the receptionist.
 I know, but I cant cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
 Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
 Hey, having fun?
 Well I know how it is. I know its a lot of fun. I dont know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
 Guys, I dont like this analogy.
 Its nice.
 Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
 Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
 Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
 No, three-month-old humans dont do that.
 Angela is such a liar!
 Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. Thats two sleep schedules, two naps that dont coincide, I mean, youll never sleep again.
 Yes, the conference room is set up. Ive got pens, Ive got paper, Ive got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
 We are good to goooo!
 Were good to goooo!
 Yes, of course, we couldve just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
 Watson carpet and tile.
 Hey, Darryl. You okay?
 No, you should go for it. I mean nothing wouldve happened with me and Jim if he didnt put himself out there.
 My husband would tell you to go for it.
 Thats it, last one.
 Thats true.
 Weapons.
 But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
 Thank goodness he was there.
 Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
 1-8-5-0-5.
 I just had a baby.
 Wow.
 How â€˜bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
  Oh boy. Oh no, Im not laughing at you. Im laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
 Aw, thats so sweet!
  He said, I did like Dwight? Hes gonna fire him.
 Robert doesnt talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
 Did you actually try your hardest?
 If Dwights about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. Thats all you can do.
 Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
 Well find another receptionist. I mean, thats easy. Well be fine.
  Hey, stranger!
 Aw, I missed you.
 Aw.
  This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, well be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
 Theres this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, its not -- it doesnt sound cool. You just have to see it.
 Well, I guess it doesnt look that cool either. But, its been up there a long time, so its become a pretty big deal.
 Did a good job, Buddy. Now its time to come home.
 What?
 You messed up saying your name?
 Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
 How can you give us performance reviews if you dont know us?
 No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
 I like working here.
 Phyllis.
 Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the managers position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. Im easy.
 Whoa, thats kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
 Well, I mean, the only reason he doesnt is because Im breastfeeding, and Phillip doesnt like a bottle.
 No.
 I think... youre a witch.
  Im amazing.
 Hey Jim. Stanleys back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
 Its nice. Its funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
 Yeah he does.
 Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
 Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
 Okay, which one of these looks more right?
 Welcome back, Stanley.
 Oh!
 Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
 Im sorry, were throwing a party for someone because theyre being horrible?
 Im still not sure why this woman is even here.
 I know, right?
 Phyllis!
 Hey, whats up?
 So were planning this party for Nellie, and were gonna make it really bad.
 No. Were gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
 What?
  Okay.
 What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You dont have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
 Oh, okay. Okay, I will.
 Or what if...
 We discuss...  the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party.  Not mean.
 What are you talking about? Yes we can.
 Okay, theyre almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?
 No, thats a great idea. Lets have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
 Cause theres someone already here named Pam.
 Oh!
 Thats not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
 Hey Hank.
 I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
 Yeah, he came and went.
 Lets just- lets go.
 Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book."
 You know, like arent some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
 Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we dont want to bother you any more than we already have.
 Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
 Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew theyd be good together.
  Kelly has been a handful in the past.
  But shes had a bad influence. Shes like an addict.  And I just had to get her clean.
 Dont shake our baby?
 Okay. Id never heard that before. So, thank you.
 Yeah, Im glad you said something.
 Yeah, theyre really great together.
 I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
 Yeah, hes so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
 I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
 Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
 That a couple of times-
 Okay, stop.
 All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
 Fair enough. Um... I dont think youre a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like Ive said this to you before I dont like you very much.
 Oh, no, no, no.
 Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
 Read through the pain. Be strong.
  Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
 Boo!
 Barf! Ugh, you suck!
 Youre not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryans soul?
 "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches."
 "He is a drifter out to sea."
 Its just so dumb.  But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
 Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
 Smokey, the bear?
 No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? Whats one more?
 I dont think you love Smokey Robinson. I think youre just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
 Oh my God, Ryan! Thats perfect! You have to go!
 250 dollars is nothing to the worlds biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
 Tears of a clown!
 Dwight, I dont think hes going to hurt anybody.
 Oh, great! That sounds good!
 Sounds like youre doing alright.
 Oh my god!
 Whoa!
 Are you-- Twice! For real?
 Life is Downton Abbey.
 Hm-hmm.
 Or you proved that he thinks youre gay.
 Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
 Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. im Sorry Oscar.
 Absolutely, its awesome--
 Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
 What do you feed her?
 Does she smell?
 Oh, it was this summer â€“
 Um, I am a little busy.
 Yeah, I can make you a list.
 Why dont I help you now?
 Okay.
 Sowhat do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
  Hey.
 I stole Nellies phone.
 What do you want from me?
 Sounds like it.
 Okay, thats enough.
 No, no, no!
 Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. Theyre all deleted.
 Ah. Ahh.
 Hey.
 Um yes. Definitely. With your hair â€“
 Certainly. Um you dropped your cell phone.
 Yep.
 No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
 No, I will not.
 Well â€“
 But sometimes he talks about flesh and bacchanals.
 No dont. Just put it out of your mind.
 I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
  Family picture!
 What? Honey, we talked about this.
 Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
 No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
 We decided that theres no way Dwight would harm a child.
 No, no.
 But its free. And well keep our eye on them.
 Yes!
 And well make sure Dwight doesnt do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Oh, great. Thank you.
 Okay.
 You ready?
 There we go.
 Ill just stand here?
 See? That wasnt so hard.
 You hit her?
 Oh, Andy.
 But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
 David, what are you doing here?
 For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
 Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
  Yes, Jims friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
 And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
 He said if it takes off hes gonna buy us a new car.
 And that was our summer.
 Dont you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
 Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I dont think anythings gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids theres just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
 Dwight!
  What are you doing?
 I will?
 Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
 No.
 Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
 Exactly the way it is.
 Yes, and theres nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
 Find someone else, I dont know. Ask Phyllis.
 You ready?
 Kay.
  The buildings custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, were living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
 Well, it doesnt spin. Well just move the wheel one notch each morning and you see what chore you get that day.
 No, Im familiar with spinning. Its just that wouldnt work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
  â€˜Kay.
 Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
 I dont think you guys understand why were doing this. Its-
 Ive been through several rounds of development with the team and heres where we stand with the chore wheel.  Weve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; its more fun this way.
  The tiny wheel actually does have chores. Its so cute no one seems to mind.
  Toilets!
  Thanks, mom!
 Yeah. Im afraid hes only gonna have hot dogs.
 Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
 Think so.
  Thank you.
  Yes, thank you.
  Whos that?
  Ha-ha.
 No. Roy? No.
  We still surprise each other.
 You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
 Yes. But, what I didnt tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didnt go because it was-
 In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other?
 Tell me one thing about you I dont know.
 And you thought you guys were millionaires.
 Yes. But theres, wait, oh, theres a funny ending to that story. I cant remember.
 Thought you were millionaires, yeah. Thats funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
 Uh-huh.
 Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
 Johnny Depp.
 I think maybe there actually is something I dont know about Jim.
 OK. Well, heres something you dont know. A couple of weeks ago-
 I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didnt tell you because, I dont know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didnt know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought youd want to know.
 Yeah, I wouldve. What about you? Come on, theres gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just havent had the chance to tell me.
  Just tell me.
 Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Gricos at 730.
 Jims at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
 . Is everything okay?
 Great.
 Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
  Im sorry, Im leaving you alone for lunch.
 You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
 Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
 Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
 What?
 Sure.
 So hes not related to Michelle Obama?
||
 Nellies pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
||
 Yeahâ€”turn signal. Its exciting to be painting againâ€”those are the wipers. Soâ€”theâ€”itsâ€”just. There you go! Yeah.   Yeah, things get so busy with the kidsâ€”red lightâ€”that its nice to have that creative outletâ€”red light! Red light! Red! Red!
 Well, since were stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angelas baby.
 Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
  Thank you.
 Week off. Thatd be great.
 Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
 A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
 Yeah, OK then.
 Whats this?
 Its OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
 Oh my god! Ah!
 You know what? Its fine, its fine. Let me just...its fine.
 Oh! Yes!
 My name is Pam.
 I like to paint.
 You think youre better?
 Oh no you aint!
 Hey, wheres Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
 No, I mean hes sulking. Thats not like him.
 Then why isnt he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
 Hey honey, I dont think we should push him.
 Phyllis! Thats not safe.
  Go up and check on him. Hes upset.
 Please? Just make sure hes OK?
 Oh!  Hey! Howd it go?
 Yeah?
 You feel OK now?
 Well, actually, rhubarb is-
 the one pie that I dont.
 Oh my god. Im getting so stuffed.
 You did it.
 Role call.
 Hey.
 I am Dr. Cinderella.
 Im an oncologist and you are a dog.
 So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
 Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
 Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
 You were in an a capella group?
 Yeah. I mean, listen if were gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
 I kind of am. Its crazy.
 Okay.
 Okay I give up. What are you?
  Gross. I love it.
 Hey, howd it go?
 Did you end up investing?
 How much?
 About ten?
 Wow.
 Wow.
 No yeah. Yeah.
 So did everybody ...
 Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
 What?
 They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
 So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
 Talk about it now.
 Jim, that was most of our savings.
 We said some. We said â€˜some.
 We said part not all.
 Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
 No Im just, Im saying, what would happen if they didnt sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
 No! No, Im interested. I mean I think everybodys interested in why they have to sing it.
 Yeah, yeah, no, no. Its a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you cant do if you just keep singing â€˜Monster Mash.
 Andys family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
 The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way hes been handling it is just..so..
 Right?
  Oh, great! Yeah, um, Ill get right back to you.  Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
 Nope, thats Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?
  Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interviews off. Theyre opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
 Hes gonna be disappointed.
  Please hold for Ms. Black.
  Good afternoon Iris, its a pleasure.
 No the papers not toxic.
 Unless its exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
 Andy.
 Can you go instead?
 Youve got this Schrute.
 Oh, Ill be the buyer.
 Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
 Okay, lets stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
 Okay, when youre selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
 Okay, well you have to show us.
 Huh.  Uh huh.
 A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
 Nellie, why dont you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that youre listening.
 Ten years ago, I didnt care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now Im like, that poor gimp is somebodys child.
 You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
 Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
 Okay, so, when youre selling to this woman, just imagine that shes that nice, reasonable barber.
 Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
 Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
 Oh, great. Oh, Im sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we dont have it.
 Okay, great.
 Oh my God. Its Jan.
 Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
 Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
 Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! Its so great to see you.
 What?
 Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
 So this was all just a trick. You dont really have any business to give?
 But not to us.
 You did good, Dwight. Its okay. I mean, seriously, Jans not normal. Lets just go. Shes not going to sell to us.
 What?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
 Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
 And it is so cute how she signs her name.
 Oh, okay. Its just thats how Cece does it with the backwards â€˜Es.
 Oh, actually she can.
 Of course.
 Um... â€œAâ€... â€œXâ€? I dont -- you got me.
  Im so sorry. I hate this. Youre better.
 Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
 Oh, my God.
 Okay, you do not have to do this.
 Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
 Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
 Thats a license number?
 Oh. Why me?
 These are my painting clothes.I think Im gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
 Are you avoiding your phone call?
 Last week Jim wasnt there, and they named the company Athlead.
 Tell them your opening line.
 I think its good. He likes fishing.
  I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. Its just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, Im gonna limit myself to one shrub.
 Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
 Its probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
 I could get us a complaint.
 No, I wouldnt. I cant even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. Id like to try.
  Hello, this is Pam Halpert. Im calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, â€œHey, kool-aid.â€ Yeah, your mamas fat. This is Pam Halpert.
 Basically I couldnt tell, but I think...
 I-- I thought they were confused at least...
 I did not know that.
 Im so sorry.
 If youre an artist, you have to be okay with the idea Â that you cant please everybody all the time.
 Shut up, Hide! Â I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? Im okay with that.
 Im sure its fine. its a blue shirt.
 Im on it.
 Were the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwights party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe its not. Maybe its going to be great. And if its great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
 Yes! Phyllis!
 What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
  The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that were all going to do Dwights Christmas.
 Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
 And that is...
 That there are no rules.
 Youre welcome.
 What is it?  Dont touch it.
 Oh!
 I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
 And the fear.
 Wow.
  Mouse trap.
 Well...this is it.
 Shut up. Im trying to be serious.
 I cant believe this is actually happening.
 Okay.  Good luck. Youre gonna be great.
 Okay.
 Love you.
 Whats going on?
 What?
 Jims been spending a few days a week in Philly and Im not gonna lie, its been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. Im exhausted. But dont tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and hes doing it all for the family.
 Great. Everythings great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
 Oh, call me later!
 Good luck!
 Love you.
 Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
 He didnt leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please?
 Im sure shes just confused. People scratch their heads when theyre confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
 Dwight, relax. Its just lice. Maybe, possibly.
 Stop that!
 Alright, lets give her a break. We dont know for sure this is Merediths fault.
 No! How? Im so clean!
 Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
 Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So lets not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, Ill tell her it was me.
 Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
 Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
 Oh stop! I am so sorry!
 Nothing.
 I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, well have a few laughs. Theres a right way to do this.
 Shes right, it works. I would imagine.
 Oh! Uh, uh Ill go.
  No, no, its not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while Im at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
 Okay.
 Oh, no everythings great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
 Hes really making you work for it, huh?
 Great. I am killing it over here.  Jim, I gotta go.
 Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
  Creed, Im all done. My turn.
 Well, wait.
   Hello?
 What, no. That cant...I dont...
 You guys, I am so sorry! Its just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
 Is there a volume knob on that thing?
 Meredith, I am so sorry.
 I meant to say something earlier. I just...
 Hey honey, its me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
 Im just gonna go home. My moms been watching the kids all day.
 Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
 Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
 I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
 Get it, girl!
  This ones for all you ladies out there.
 Not yet.
 Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
 Ha ha. Thatd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get What do you get? Oh my god! Why didnt I think of this? Andys not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, Im expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
 A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everythings in order.
  Okay, see you later.
 You ready for your interview?
 Well, you shouldnt be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
 Really, you cant be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but hes basically Gumby with hair.
 Good!
 I just wanted to see you!
 Wow, this place is so great. I had no idea â€“ on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
 Sure, no problem.
 Thats sweet that he talks about me.
 Well, thats funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
 Theyre the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. Its like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I dont blame Cece.
 Say they dont hire you. Its not like youre out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
 Right? Thank you! Its just Philly. Everyones acting like its New York or Paris or London.
 Not us.
 Congratulations.
 I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
 No, Im not upset. Im really excited for Darryl Maybe Im a little disappointed that well be losing him.
  Everybody dance now
  Hey What happened here?
 Are the pens here?
  Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
 You dont remember?
  Theres nothing down here.
 Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
 Oh, no, Kevin, its not a joke. Angelas husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
 Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now Im just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, lets be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
 Well, Im heading out to Ceces dance recital.
 Hey, Cece, Daddys gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
 Lets call him.
 Hey, Hon, are you close?
 What?
 Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you werent gonna make it.
 Of course.
 Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
 I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, were getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, â€œBye, Daddy.â€
 Oh, Im sorry. Sorry.
  Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God!
  Um, Im sorry. I have to go. My daughters a ladybug. I know that doesnt make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
 Shh! Kids are dancing.
  Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
 Anyone want to see the video from Ceces recital?
 All right, you dont have to.
 Okay.
 Wait. What?
  Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
 Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
 Well, it was an important phone call.
 I havent told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, hes always like, â€œBeesly!â€ I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- â€œBeesly!â€
 Night
 Night, Creed.
 Hey.
 So, hows it going?
 Im so sorry.
  Oh, Im sorry. I feel like youve already been working insanely hard.
 Um, actually, funny story -- I didnt get it. I shouldnt have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
 No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
 Yeah, okay, Im sorry. Im sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
 Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
 I dont know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
 You know what? I-- I-- I dont think you want to start a conversation with me about whats fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
 I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
 Yep.
 Yep. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 Bye.
 What am I doing wrong, Brian?
||
 Its getting tougher. I just didnt know that it was gonna be this hard.
 Thank you.
 Hey Brian, you got a sec?
 I feel awful.
 Well, thanks for being a good friend.
 Yeah, mostly.
 Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
 Okay. Thank you.
 When are you talking to David Wallace?
 Too late. My hopes are up.
  Its fine. Its just a seating arrangement. Doesnt matter.
 Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
 Hey, Im the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jims away. Im in a position where Im rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
 Hide, theyre giving out jobs upstairs. Why dont you go up and get one?
 Yeah.
 Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
 Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
 Of course.
 Okay.
 Bye.
 Im good.
 Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
 Us.
 Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ill distract him, you take that.
||
 No, Dwight!
 Hey Brian, you got a sec?
 I feel awful.
 Well, thanks for being a good friend.
 Yeah, mostly.
 Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
 Okay. Thank you.
 When are you talking to David Wallace?

 Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
 Us.
 Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ill distract him, you take that.
||
 No, Dwight!
 Ive really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because hes in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. Im usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I dont know, this time I feel like its, um, its really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? Youve gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way!
  Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I dont know everybodys name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. Its my choice.
 I dont demand justice often. Im not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Vals no help. Andys gone. Jims out. I just feel like Im on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
  Conference room. Everybody. Now!
 Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... Thats gonna be revealed once were in the conference room for the meeting.
 Yeah.
  I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
 Yeah, but this is different.
 I dont think so, but they put paint where I didnt want paint. So...
 Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
 Yes. Thank you. Lets answer that question.
 What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
 Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
  No, no. Come on, guys. Dont go.
 You will?
 Thank you.
 Yeah?
 Great.
 I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, Im pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
 We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
 See, I feel bad about that.
  Tell us who defaced the mural!
 All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
  Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if Ive done anything to offend you. Im sure it isnt easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
 Well, I didnt think that butt was funny.
 What was that?
 Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
 That sucked. He didnt apologize. Theres no talking to that guy.
 We should just take him down.
 Im saying we should go scorched earth on that guys face.
 Yes!
 Yes!
 We need an infiltrator.
 Clark?
 Shh, shh.
 Shh. Remember your lines.
  Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
 OK. What does he like? Whats important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
 Yeah, something like that.
 Oh, great!  His truck!
 OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
 Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on.
 Im done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
 Aw, Dwight. Thats really sweet.
 Oh, no. Um, I, Im embarrassed. Its stupid.
 Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
 Yeah. I feel better.
 I know. You miss Angela, dont you?
 I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. Its gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
No, you had no right!
 So? You started it!
 Whoa.
 Well, Im gonna say something to the producers.
 You shouldnt be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
 Forget about my mural. Its stupid.
 Its crazy. Brian, Im so sorry.
 Thanks, Brian.
  Hey. I feel so lucky were in the same city for Valentines Day.
  Alakazam!
 And, poof! He disappears.
  These are gross.
 Oh, hey, dont fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
 Its with Brian and Alyssa.
 I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
 That sounds nice.
 Sorry were late.
 Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
 Hes on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
 Yeah.
 Well, my dad cant hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
 Wheres Alyssa?
 Oh.
  Yeah.
 OK, I can tell youre mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I dont know, tell me why?
 I didnt tell you about the crying because I didnt want you to know how upset I was. Because it wouldve stressed you out and youre always saying how much you dont want more stress.
 Its not Brians fault.
 OK.
 Oh?
 Are you sure?
  Yeah.
 OK.
  Wow. I didnt know you kept this.
 Thank you.
 I dont think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
 Yeah, I do.
 He sounds like a wounded animal.
 Ok.
  Oh thats mine! Um, Ill just, Ill get it out of the way for you.
 Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. Its um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  Im sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
 Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
  hello!
 Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
 Ok
  Whats that? Is that a-
 How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
 Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
 Thanks.
 Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
 Ha ha.
 Bye.
 Hello.
 Hi, Pam, hello.
 Im Pam Halpert.
 Oh my god. Hes Michael Scott.
  Oh my god.
 Yeah, Ive seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but Ive actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
 Oh, cause it was upside down.
 So um-
 Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
 Yes.
 Two children, yes.
 I am not pr-
 Pregnant, no.
 Wow.
 Im sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
 So, kinda like a receptionist.
 Yes.
 I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I cant.
  hey!
 Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
 Eight? Really?
 Sure. I mean, its Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. Ill see you at eight.
 Love you.
 Hello?
 Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
 Oh, Jim I should have told you I didnt get the job.
 Oh, yeah. Im more than alright. Theres just nothing to celebrate.
  Youre very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
 So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
 Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
 Guess what poster he had on his wall?
 MmMm.
 MmMm. Youre getting colder.
  No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
 I dont know, but its interesting right?
 He said he cant help but tear up when he looks at it. Its like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
 Mmhm.
 I dont know.
 I know. Its just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I dont know, I dont know if I want, um, I dont know if I want this.
 Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
 Oh, Dwight. Im so sorry. Were you guys close?
  bad.
 Todd, youre just saying insults in the form of an apology.
 I think its called Nibbles.
 Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Dont eat the cupcake.
 I dont think we should eat Packers cupcakes. We cant give him the satisfaction.
 We cant let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
 Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
 So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
 Kevin, um, lets think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
 Yes. He was a good spy.
 Guys, Im proud of us. I think we did the right thing.  Hey!
  Wait!
 No, no. Its the principle of the thing.
 Good morning, Erin.
 Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesnt know, its OK.
 Phyllis!
 No!
 Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
 Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
 But, Kevin thats...
 Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately shes been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you dont know what it is, its a book about um...
 Yeah.
 Be careful. I pulled my moms dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
 Shes listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
  Cici has been calling me Pamela. Like four times this week.
 I wonder if shell start calling you Jim.
  Um.
 Youre- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
 Oh, oh OK.
  Um, Ok. Well?
 Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
 Ok.
 Bye.
 Uh huh.
 It wasnt so bad.
 Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
 Oh my god!
 Brian?
 Yeah, I guess I could.
 Hey!
 Hi, um. Im sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
 Oh my gosh, please, dont.
 Sure, yeah. Yeah.
 OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view.
 Oh, thank you.
 Cheers.
 So..
 Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
 Yeah. Its kinda crazy.
 See all this like old stuff, like um, theres that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
 Yeah, wasnt that neat?
 Yeah, and theres this one when we were listening to music and its like, its like w were in love and we didnt even know we were in love and its...but- Do you think Jims changed?
 Im sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
 I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like hes- I just feel like...hes so into his work right now and....I dont know, am I crazy?
 Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and theyre kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
 You know, stuff people didnt intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
 How much stuff you got.
 Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
 So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
 Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
 No I think you explained it.
 I hope you got sound on everything. Id love a DVD of that.
 Well, we wont be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Â   I wish.
 Oh, nothing that exciting.
 Hmm.
 You know, Jims kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
 I mean, weve having issues. It cant hurt to talk about them, right?
 He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, heÂ shouldntÂ be rewarded for that.
 I feel like hes always making these decisions for the family, and then Im left playing catch-up.
 Im sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I dont want him to do it anymore, and I dont want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
 I didnt see you! You should have yelled â€œCrossing!â€
 Ok, so is that my spot?
 Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
 So, we had couples therapy.
 And we have homework.
 And were also supposed to speak our truths.
 Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldnt have had this opportunity for couples therapy.
 Hey!
 Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
 Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  Theres a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
 Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
 I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
 Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-
 Uh, to speak my truth, Id appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice.
 Really? Ive been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? Thats really your truth?
 Were not high.
 I wish wed started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
 Ok.
 Jim!
 Alright, have a good trip.
 Bye.
 I love you.
 Its great.
 The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
 Nice morning, too.
 Wow.
 its okay. You can sit in the annex.
 Ill come visit you.
 Oh, Andy.
 Yes. Yeah.
 Oh, boy. Umâ€”
 I could give you some beginner stickies?
 Here you go.
 Mm-hmm.
 Its all yours.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 Um, I have a question.
 Oh, I had a question.
 I did!
 Super important.
 Okay.
 All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
 I dont know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
 Exactly.
 Im back. Oh, hey, look, and now its like a double date.
 Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
 Oh, well, Thursdays tough, because ofâ€”
 They are.
 Whats going on?
  Congratulations, Dwight.
 Its nice to have you back.
 Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
 Is that them again?
 Maybe you should call back?
 When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, hes giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, hes certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
 Question.
 We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as theyre delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, â€œNice jugsâ€?
 What are you so excited about?
 What are you up to?
 Nice.
 Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
 Darryl, hey.
 Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
 Aha. Hows Athlead?
 Wow.
 He says he doesnt want to.
 Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
 Thats what he says.
 Hey.
 Are you happy?
 No, I know that youre, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
 And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
 What about five years from now?
 Because Im so glad youre back, baby, but Im justâ€”I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like youre giving up so much.
 Okay.
 I kind of forced you to do it.
 Yes, I did.
 Im afraid that youre gonna resent me and Im afraid thatâ€”
 This is not enough for you and Im afraid that Im not enough for you.
 He does have a gift.
 What is this?
 Go ahead.
 Yeah.
 Whats that?
 Thank you.
 What? Dwight, you cant do that.
 Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyones ever been fired, Tobys blocked it, so
  Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
 I think she looks good. Now that shes wearing sports bras, we dont see her boobs as much.
  Darryl! Andy!
 Were fine. Yeah.  And Im sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldnt you be?
 Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. Hows the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
 Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
 Oh, boy.
 Wait, wait. What?
 Uh, that seems inappropriate.
 Whoo-hoogo, Merediths stripper son.
 No, no, Im fine.
 Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I dont know. Im working on something.
  Im sorry. Is there a question?
 Oh, um, well, you know, I I just I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if youd been filmed for nine years of your life, thered be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
 Listen, um I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didnt want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because hes shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now its better than a fairy tale. Its like a long book that you never want to end.  And youre fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
 Yeah, like Harry Potter.
 Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
 Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
  Oh, my gosh, its choreographed!
 He just so happy to have a family plan.
 Is it me? Is it Nellie?
 I need to get out of this dress.
   Why are you still here?
 Okay, Okay. Um so this past year has been really great, and youve been great and I just I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldnt be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
 About 2 months
 Yeah.
 Well, you you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
 Austin? Maybe.
 Im doing it for us.
 Hold on a second.  Wait, what did you just say?
 I wanna do this.
 I really want to do this!
 Were so excited.
 Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that Ive painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead!
 Everyone, Lets take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I justI kind of meant just everybody from the office.
 Okay.
  Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, Im sorry. Jim Halpert doesnt work here anymore.
 I didnt watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. Its just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. Itd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that Im a tragic person. Im really happy now. Butit would justjust make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself â€œbe strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isnt that long.â€
 What about the honeymoon?
 I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing
 And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. Well come back to visit. But I think its time for us to officially
 Thanks Dwight.
 I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in allI think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. Theres a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isnt that kind of the point?
