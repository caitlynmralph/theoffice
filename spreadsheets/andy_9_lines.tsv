 Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, itll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
 Whatre you still doing here?
 You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
 See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. Its Clark and, umâ€”
 In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
 Cause youre always taking dumps.
 Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
 No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
 Whoa! Mind blown. Its like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
 Dwight, Jr!
 David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
 Yeah, I gotta go David.  Why is Nellie still here?
 Mm, then I will make up a cause.
 Then forget I just told you that.
 Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
 I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. Its going to be terrible.
 No Im going to make sure that it is. And if it isnt, Im going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I dont like to throw around the b-word, but Im going to be a huge bitch to you.
 Now this is called slack lining.
 I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
 If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then youll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
 Thats me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athletes foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
 All right, whos next? Nellie?
 Nonsense. Get up here.
 Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
 Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa!  You suck. Alright, whos next? Darryl?
 Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
 Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
 Focus on the horizon.  Whoa! Look at this guy.
 Hey, yes.
 Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
 Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
 Well its official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
  Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
 Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
 Im not doing it for you. Im doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
  Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
  Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
 Really?
 Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
 Awesome.  Plop!
 Her body. Were gonna talk about her body.  Good. Great job.
  Erin has an audition to be a newscaster.
 Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
 Yeah, right?
 Yeah.
 News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
 Shes gonna be amazing. Look at her. Shes gonna light up the screen.
 I love it. Its fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
 Pause after news.
 No, pause longer.
 Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Dont be shy.
 Wha, its-
 OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
 Yeah.
 All right!
 Nice.
  Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
 He sure did.
 Just, you sure Clark?
 No, I just, I dont mean Erin. I mean for me. I didnt feel good about that.
 I dont think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
 All right.
 Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
 OK.  Ill call you later.
  So this is a single.
  Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
 Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
 As in...
  Wow!
 This is super-flattering. Shes the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
 My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
 Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...Im related to Michelle Obama.
 There he is!
  Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
 Its me!  I am related to Michelle Obama.
 I mean, its distant, but...
 Right?
 Darryl said, â€œCool, man.â€ He called me as cool man.
 Whats going on here? Im related to the first lady, okay? Get over it.  I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! .
 Why? Is it employees day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
 Does anyone else think its possible that I come from slave owners?
 Hey mom, its Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about Americas national shame, thanks, Bye.
 . Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
 So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? Im trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
 Not my slaves, my ancestors. Maybe. Probably not.
 That youre learning a made-up language from HBOs Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
 Hi guys.
 Yeah. You dont have to ask me.
Pam
 Alright everybody, great season of softball, Im super proud of you guys and I think youre gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together.
 A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail!  Whos this guy?
 Do do do do do do do.
 Cant take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
 Hey, Im Pete, puberty is such a drag, man. And Im Clark! I like to eat toilet paper.  We fail!
Id like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.
Well, thats all folks. Ski ya later everybody.  Thanks for a great season.
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Oh that wasnt...that didnt work. That was not the right..
 That was not a fail.
 That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.  Youre all failing right now.  Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!
 Um, OK Im just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
 I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
 Fine. I will give you one minute.
 You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of its baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
 A baby what? A human?!
 Oh.
 Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I dont think so.
 And I happen to notice youre down to about thirty seconds here.
 And those sand grains are tumbling..
 With fury...
 Down the sides..
 Of the hourglass..
 Times up!
 Sure.  Ill read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. Ill sign that.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
 Whoa!
 Yo. Dudeces.
 Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
 Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve!  Ah OK, now a serious one.
 Banana cream is the first to go.  Well be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!
 Who is it?
 Yeah. Perfect time. Im right in the middle of a rooftop crisis.  Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok,  blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, youve made this very easy for me. Its unsignable.
 Its inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
 Heres the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
  British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
 What?
 I changed my mind.
 Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it.  Well, yeah, whatever. So.
 My name is Andy!
 I dont do drugs!
  Now check the style!
 Of Flatt & Scruggs!
 A jitterbug.  You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
 Not a question.
 Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
 Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
 Aaah!  So good!
 My Cornell a capella group.
 Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
 Atta boy Clark!
 No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
 You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michaels Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. Im so not prepared.
 Ruh duh duh da dudes! Whats up?
 I know that its pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, thats when I became somebody. When I got the nickname "Boner Champ," that is when I became me.
 You didnt come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, nows your chance! Im here. You got Qs; I got As.
 No, I dont have AIDS. Thats not what I said. Next question.
 You dont have any-- Any questions about the old days?  You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
 Im sorry, what?
 Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
 I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that youre Boner Champ.
 Did you maybe tell them that or...?
 Could you just call them and tell them the truth? Cause I know its really stupid, but its also really, really, really important.
 Love you too.
 Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
 Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
 Did he tell you how I got the name?
 Spring sing â€˜95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
 They didnt know about the snowman story, and when I told â€˜em, they were not impressed.
 Right?
 Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
 Oh Man!
 No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
 Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
 Thats my signature song.
 Russell, Im dressed like George Michael.
 Wha...?
 Shut up, Broccoli.
 You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A mans signature solo is his for life, okay? Thats group policy and you know it.
 Just dont do the song anymore.
 Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
 I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
 OK, fine, yeah. thats one guys opinion!
 Doesnt mean youre the best singer ever. Dick.
 This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
 I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
 Duh. I know. That would be insane.
 It could totally work though. I dont know why we wouldnt. Oh my god are we doing this?
 If I am not Boner Champ, I dont know who I am.
 Make a donation.
 Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
  Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there.  What?
 My parents are broke.
 Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
 White, Im not a day trader, Im just a first responder in a disaster.
 Are the Nards hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, Im kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, thats cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so,  him.
 Yeah. Hes in rehab actually.
 No, its in New Mexico.
 Were done Meredith.
 Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldnt steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
 Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas.
 Alright, whats the grand total? Did we make our nut?
 Guys, you dont understand, this boats been in our family since before I was born.
 Alright, uh...alright. Im gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
 Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, dont need the boat. Cant cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it?  Excuse me.
 Uh, did you need something?
 Ok.  thanks.
 Look, its not that I dont want-
 All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldnt let me. Said â€œYou cant be a skipper until youre a man.â€ You know, Id reach for the wheel and hed smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now Im the man of the family and... were selling the damn thing. So Im never gonna have the chance.
 Tonight.
 Yeah right. Its in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
 Yeah, ok.
 Seriously?
 Alright.
 Lets do it.
 Thats the family boat!
 Right?
 Sorry?
 Sure, I um..I didnt know.
 Ok.
 Geez, a little bit.  How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
 It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
 Really?
  Up she goes!
 Oh, its OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
 You got it. You know what then, well just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor.
 You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just-  wow.
 Ok, fine.
 Yeah, fine.
 Good stuff. Nice stuff.   Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
 Ive had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
 Fine. But I could have.
 I am the captain.
 Right?
 Im the captain.  Hey, charm school.
 Im taking it over from here.
 Yeah, I know cause Im sailing it there.
 Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
 Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.   Walt?
 I thought you were in rehab.
  I didnt.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But Ive decided to sail it to Bermuda.
 Same thing.  Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
 Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? Youre the best ever!
  Good? Come on. Above and beyond. Worlds Greatest. You did this! Dammit Im happy!
  Ill see you in three weeks!
 No way!
 Erin I gotta go! Thems my chords!
  Ah, what else? Ive seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
 That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
 No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  Theyre like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
  Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. Thats what I call the sun now.
 What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
 Yeah, it was. Thats okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
 Ah! Thats not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?
  I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
 No. No! Nooo!
  Hi Dwight.
 Well, well, well, look who it is.
 I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
 Hey! Sweetheart!  I have missed you so much.
  I have been dreaming of this moment.
 Well, Valentines surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, its a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. Its so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop em. Its called Bembe.
 Obviously, thats why Im here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentines Day, sweetheart.  But, Im just saying, Im also excited about the Wallace meeting.
 I have no idea. I dont know what he knows or doesnt know. But weve been in touch the whole time. I mean, its not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. Its in every Bembe cafe.
 Question. Wheres Jim?
 For two hours? Really?
 If the shoe fits.
 I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
 And you sold it to Jan too.
 I mean... Im impressed.
 Well, theres one problem. Couldnt help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
 I was...
That...
 OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word coolio.
 Say it.
 Coolio.
 Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
 Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
 I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
 Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
 No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
 It, its, its actually just an issue...
 Jan, I dont know what hes talking about but...
 Well, ah, ah...
 Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
  Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, were a smidge behind on my paychecks.
 All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Whos that little fella?
 Wow, thats wonderful!
 Uh-huh.
 Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, were all up to speed.
  Whats going on in here, dirty players? Lets get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Whos that girl? Whos that girl? Its Andy!  All right. Back to work.
 I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
 Not helpful. Lets stay positive, people. OK?
 Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
 Thank you.
 Great!
  We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
 What?!
 There was a fire in the warehouse?
 This is what Im talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
 What?!
 No kidding?
 Wow. Go Kathy. Shes like 50.
 Good, good. What else?
 Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
 The warehouse fire. Werent you just down there? Its like burnt to ashes.
  I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, thats one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
 I think youll agree I explained that pretty well.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, I guess.
 Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
 What?
 OK, I get it. Youre unhappy. Ive been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
 On your side. But theres tons on my side. Its gushing. Were just out of sync right now. But thats just timing, its timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
 I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If were lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
 Im gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
 I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I wont be able to tell the difference. So, Ill feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, youll actually start to love me again.
 Yes.  Come on. Totally.
 I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
 And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
 Oscar says â€œhiâ€ all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. â€œHiâ€ â€œHelloâ€ â€œHolaâ€ Youre telling me youve never heard Oscar say â€œhiâ€?
 But youre calling me a liar.
 By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies youve been telling lately.
 Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.  â€œHey Andy, alls well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wifes sick.â€ Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
 This has been a really tough time.
 Yeah.
 Erin just dumped me and I cant remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
 It was like a security blan-
 -ket
 Youre not?
 Thats awesome.
 David, Ill be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. Ill be there for you. Thats a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
 Crystal.
 Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
 Good morning.
 And how are you on this fine-
  Ok, we ready?  Dont use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
  Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
 Where are you going?
 Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
 Im still the boss!
 The answer is yes.
 Are they from you?
 Well then, I dont want them. You can keep em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
 Nope, I insist upon it. Its an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
 I dont want to talk about work right now.
 Then I want my big blue sweater back.
 She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
 Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Heres the sitch Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
 Survey says ENH! Doesnt make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
 Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
 No.
 May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.
 Why doesnt Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasnt she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
 Im not snooping, theres just some crud on her screen.
 Uh, hello! Whos snooping on who now?
 Everyone please, just-
 Oh my god.
 Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think Im psycho again. Uh, couldnt shake this feeling that Erins dating someone so I looked at her phone.
 Too late. I found out shes been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
 Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, Im just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted  shlmydia...from Erin. And its incurable. Pretty lame huh?
 I knew it!
 You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
 No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? Youre fired!
 Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day-
 ..The camera dont lie!
 Youre being an idiot get..
 Out of my office, turns out youre fired...
 Because you suck.
 And youre fired...
 So you had a bad day...
 Rut ti doh doh...
 Rut tit doh doh...
 Rut ti doh doo doh
 No.
 Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
 They already have a contract?  â€œMutually agree to-â€ Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
 Well, Im not signing away my rights.
 Ok, well well see about that.
 Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
 Ugh.
 That doesnt matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I dont care if theyre Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliets boss also had feelings.
 What?!
  Sorry.
 My whole life is a booger bubble!
 Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation penis. Translation? My manhood.
 Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
 Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
 Yeah, so life gives you lemons and youve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you dont want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So thats fun.
 Hi.
 Hi, hows it going?
 Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
 Awkward.
  Really uncomfortable situation.
 Its alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta â€œmove onâ€. Aint that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. Hows that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.
 Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
 Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyones day?
 Really? Hmm. Thats interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldnt be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
 And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
 Well get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
 Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does.
 Wow, youre right. It is just about the cupcakes.
  Oh my god. I forgive him so much.  Whoa, is he choking?
 Last night? Oh, god, um, I dont know.  Na, nothing really. Kevin?
 Im not, a... Im just. I dont know.  Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um.  Pretty normal night.
 Yeah. I didnt see you last night at all.
 What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
 Well there you go. Thats muy caliente.
 Excuse me, dirty birdie
 You can have this back at the end of the day.   Oh!!
 Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. â€œBanjo at 019 is aightâ€ Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean thats the guys name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
 Of course there are!
 People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says â€œYou guys are killing it!â€ I mean, were internet sensations guys!
 Oh! Seven new comments. â€œThe guy at 019 is hawt!â€  â€œHi Bongripper, its me, Andy. The guy from 019, Im glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!â€ â€œHes not hawt, hes gay.â€  â€œDear JasonJasonJason, its me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? Im not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.â€  â€œHe is hawt!â€ See, thank you, thats more like it. â€œHe is butt.â€ God dammit! Im about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
  Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out.
 Huh? Yeah, see ya.  Oh! What?!
 Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
 I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. Theres a review of the documentary!
 I dont know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, â€œRed Alert.â€
Â  I think we should.
 Its okay.  The hell does he know?
 I want you to print that out for me.
 Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generations Lisa Loeb.
 Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, Ill hold. Im sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye.
 Yeah, come on in. Im just on hold with another talent agency. Its insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, theres more. 251. 252. I cant even keep up!
  I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. Thats final.
 Yes! Im sorry Im being curt, its just Im about to land a top talent agent.
  Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
 Huh, yeah.  I mean, Im happy Angelas the first one getting famous, but its a little weird, no? I mean, she cant sing or act, so its actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
 Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin movie star!
 Come on!
 Carla Fern is not just an actors agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
 Actor?
 Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
 Does anything go on top of the mouse?
 Aw, thats cute.
 Whats the mouses name?
  Well, what cant I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadnt noticed, Ive got a pretty good British accent.
 At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
 My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaals going out on.
 Yes. And yes.
 Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility.  Im all for it.
 Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
 You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
 Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
 It doesnt include headshots.
 Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
  Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
 Well Im just trying to bring some life to it.
 Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  Its gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brothers Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, Im in Moneyballs Two.
 Go away, were running lines.
 Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow.  Uggggh! I cant even, Im so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
 Yeah, Ok.  Alright. Where were we?
 And remember  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
 W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Dont go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Lets do it six more times.
 Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, lets get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
 Yeah.
 Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, shes my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, Im just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
 Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
 Not cool.
 No. Hes- I mean, youve never acted in anything before. Hes just my entourage.
 Thats the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says â€œaction.â€
 I guess its starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. Ill put my arm around you and then I can take it-
 Got it.
 Sorry.
  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
 Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
 So how do you want, how should I do it?
  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
 Its Tom Brokaw, its a newscaster.
 Tom Brokaw!
 Which is insanely painful.
 And Ive already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
 So I just lean over this thing and then youll add the water special effect later?
 Im not comfortable doing my own stunts. Ill get nude if you want me to, Ill go full Lena Dunham but I-
 Darryl, what do I do?
 They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
 I cant squirt stuff in my eyeball.  Ive never even used an eye dropper.
 Carla! Carla!
 She yelled at me. I cant wash my eyeball. I cant do that. I cant.
 Do you believe in me?
  AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
 I can do a better one.
 I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
  AHH! AHH! AHH!
 Yeah! Yeah.
 Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agents putting me up for a furniture commercial.
 Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, whats up? Back in the small pond?
 Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
 Tell me about it, you know? Ive been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I dont know if Im wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
 David Walrus, in his native habitat.
 Yeah.
 Im gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like its a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
 Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And Ill never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
 At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
 Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I dontâ€”it just I owe it to myself and my future fans.
 Thank you, David.
 Nope. I have made up my mind. Im really sorry.
 Thank you. Not gonna need it.
 Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, Im taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
 I wasnt fired. What are you talking about? Im fired up, yes. Guys, Imâ€”Im leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
 Yeah, so, Ill see you on the red carpet. See, thats how it works.
 Im 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
 All right. I get it.
 The male is a funny species. We dont just tell each other how we feel, thats chick stuff. So instead of saying, â€œHey, Andy, I love you, man. I dont want you to leave.â€ You say something like, â€œHey, Andy, youre making the worst mistake of your life. Youre not talented.â€ Well right back at you, Darryl.
  Im gonna miss you too. Mmm!
 Its now or never.
 Yeah, sure. Whats your question?
 Well, its better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
 Nah. I like my plan better.
 What?
 Well, hello.
 Big day for you.
 Love the belt.
 You know, I dont know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dogs outta here, so letting it all hang out!
 Thank you, I appreciate that. â€˜Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
 No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
  Nothing is impossible to him who will try.  Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
 Im gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
 Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. Thats something you cant take back.
 Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. Im gonna stay on in sales.
 Okay.
 Death of a salesman.
 Sure, â€˜Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller, its a great play about crushed dreams.
  Got any hot leads?
 Brava, brava.
 How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? Its cause I had a fallback. Thats the problem. When you have fallbacks, its just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
 Everyone! Changed my mind again.
 Uh, dream. Goin with my dream. Gotta go all in, isnt that right, Jim?
 All in! Whoo!
 Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
 Yeah, but heres the thing. I cant have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else Ill never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
 Seriously?
 Come on, just do it.
 All right, fine, just know that you made me do this.
 God, Toby, dontâ€”stop blocking my hand.
 This is yourâ€”you brought this on.
 Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
 David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And Id just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
 What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
 Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
 Eleanor Roosevelt once said â€˜the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.  I think shes right.  I feel calm now.  I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, Im doing the right thing.
 Yeah.
 Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it dont squash my knickety-knacks on top.
 Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot tooâ€”
 But I justâ€”its in the past. And I feel like we shouldnt
 Rehashâ€”
 Exactly.
 Thanks, Angela. You too.
 A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
 Tuna, Im a performer. And perform I shall.
 Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary thats premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
 Yes!
 Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning Americas Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. Its a really cool show, its like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
 This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang â€œI Dreamed a Dreamâ€ from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
 No!
 No, this is my time! You dont belt on my time! I belt on my time.
  Casey Dean!
 Yeah.
 Andy. Whats yours?
 Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
 A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
 Theres a mole?
 What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
 Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
 I dont know where it came from.
 Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
 I did, I felt it.
 Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
 What?
 Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
 Me too. Hold my place in line.
 They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
 Hey, whats goin on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the younguns?
 No, its me, Andy!
 No, no, no. Im wearing makeup.
 Oh, I took out my lifts.
 Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You cant do that. You cant do that, weve all been waiting.
 I am going in there! Dontâ€”
 Dontâ€”dontâ€”
 Dont touch me.
  Hi. Youre still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. Youre like, my three favorite people ever.
  Sweetheart, youre amazing, okay? Youre obviously gonna be on the show, so its someone elses turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right,  my name is Ezra Cornell and Im just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
 Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
 Nope! Cant end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my bosss car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
 Thatsâ€”thats whatâ€”yeah. Okay, all right, well, heres the song.  Far above Cayugas waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma materâ€”
 Are you insane? Its the Cornell fight song.
 You didnt let me finish. Thats not fair.
 Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess thats the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
  Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, youre never fully dressed without a smile.  Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummellyâ€”
 Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
 One more for the doc.
 Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
 Yeah, sure, Ill talk about it. Why not? Americans next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
 Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
 After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group.  Not really my scene.
 Hey-OH!
 Yeah.
 Thank you. Yeah,
 Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
 A little warm.
  Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
 Hey!
 Didnt I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
 Hmm.
 No I didnt change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
 Surprise!
 Hey! Pam!
 Mm-hmm.
 Aw!
 Jim, its fine. Hell just get you on his cell phone and then thatll go viral.
 Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
 Thats how I got my new job in the admissions office.
 No. Its a job. Things are going great.
 Yes.
 Im sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
 Ill go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.
 Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
 Its only 600. Come on, everybodys going.
  Youre probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
  You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because youre about to leave Cornell. So say it with me  Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
 Thanks DadDarryl.
 I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, Im exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and Im still just thinking about my old pals. Only now theyre the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know youre in the good old days before youve actually left them.  Someone should write a song about that.
