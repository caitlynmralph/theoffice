  Jim is gone.  Hes gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!
 Of course.
 Absolutely not.
 Well, hes not dressed in womens clothes, so...
 You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
  I really dont think so.
||
 Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
 Yeah probably.  He didnt tell the truth a lot.
 Definitely.
 Damn.    Ill try Brookstone.
 Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
 Ah damn pop-ups.
  I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
  What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
  Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
   "Hope this helps.  -Jim"  Nice!
 Shhh.  Dont be scared.   It works.    ...oh no.
 Dont be mad, it is a business trip.
 Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
 Yes, Monkey.
 And your veil.
 Um.
 I got it.
 I got it.
 Um.
 Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
 Oh, hey, hows it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
 Shut up. Thats impossible.
 Well, I did it too.
 So what kind of commissions you get up there?
 Youre so immature!
 Hey, Jan.
 This party is going to be awesome.
 Check it out.
 Wow.
 Ill do a shot, Michael.
 Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
 Im a huge fan.
 Why do they call him The Bus?
 Smile!
 You dont have email on your phone.
 No one just called you.
 Yes. Anything.
 Ill talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
 So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if theres any known aliases, et cetera.
 He wasnt volunteering today.
 Whoa. Michael.
 Was that your per diem?
 Hey, Michael.
 Keep the wing flaps.
 Come on. Nice try, Josh!
 Yes! Ha!
 Ha, ha, ha, ha.
 Blood, urine, or semen.
  Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
 Why him?
 Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I wont say who.
 Thats not going to happen.
 Thats not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
 Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jans been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
 Michael would never let me...
 I could never do that!
   WAH!  GAH!
 Is this Jan?
 This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
 Its about Michael.
  I cant talk here.  Its too sensitive.
 No, but we should discuss that another time.
 Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
 Many of your blouses are Claibornes.
 Part of my job.
 ...noted.
  Im going... to the dentist.
 I have to have an emergency crown put in.
 Yes.  Its a new dentist.  Hes far.  I might be gone... three hours.
 Did you get anything good?
 New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
 I can save the branch.
 If you let me run it.
  "Ok" I can run it?
 Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.    Right here.  Its all for me.  Thank you.
 The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.   But once I did it, I didnt look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  Its really whats best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So , here we are.  Its all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
  Oh, by the way.  Theres a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
 Hey.
 No thanks Im stuffed.
 ...ok.
 ...so good.
 They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
 Oh, yeah.
  Crentist.
 Yep.
 Maybe thats why he became a dentist.
   Ahh.  Aaaah.
 I know...
 What?
 What is it?
 No.
 Gahh!
 I cant believe this news.  That--- wow.
 You said that?
 Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
 All right.
 Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
 Hey... I cant imagine this place without you.
 Yeah, when Im ready, Mike.  Ok lets do it.
 Thank you Angela.
 Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
 Yes.
||
 Oh please, dont be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
  No thank you.
 No thanks.
 Not my style.
 Well that was before.  Im thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, its a ridiculous choice for this climate.
  No.
 What did you---
 Yes.
 You know what?
 No!
 I think the Sebrings cool.  Its cool.  The Seabrings cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
  Dont fire me.  Please.
  I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
  Ill do anything!  Anything!  Ill do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
 Im sorry!  Ill do anything, I swear.
 You cant.  You cant.  But I promise Ill never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?    What can I do?   What can I do?  What can I do?
  Whoo!
 Awesome!
 Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
 Okay.  Whoo!
 Really?
 That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
 Youre thinking of a chicken.
 Ed was decapitated.
 You said you didnt know how to say it.
 Hey.
 If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
 When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
 That is not a statue, that is a robot.
 And how big do you want this robot?
 Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
 Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he cant chase us.
  I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
 Michael!  Michael.   Michael ...
  Oh...
 Poor little fella.
 He is a goner.
 Yeah.
 Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
 You want me to flush him?
  Argh... gah!
 What?  No, this is about the right size.
 Im sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.  It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
 I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
 Yeah.
 Oh, thank you.
 Yes, please.
 Excellent.
 Always.
 Hes not a songbird.
||
 Lets get back to work.
 Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
 No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
 Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
 A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
 A hunter.
 Damn it!
 So you excited?
 Very excited?
 Extremely excited? ... Just very?  Thats cool.
 I am very excited. Ryan hasnt made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasnt made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
 When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
 Do you know where we are, temp?
 I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  AH!  When... Damn it.
 And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, Im going to plant my seed in you.
 Smells pretty bad, doesnt it?
 Its called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
 Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  Ill be right back.
 Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
 It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
 You know what your problem is? You know why you havent made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
 Come on!
 Please be seated.
 Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
 Yes.
 Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I wont hang out with Mose so much anymore.
 What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
 Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflins suicide?
 Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
 Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scotts greatest fear?
 Wrong. Hes not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what its all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
 Wrestle him to the ground.
 Ryan. Dont. Ryan! You dont have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
 Where are all the animals?
 Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
 You still mad? Its just Jim and I didnt get along, and I didnt want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
 Screwgun. The sales call!
 Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. Thats why youre losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
 Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
 Good.
 Right.
 Uh huh.
 Exactly. Yes.
 They did not. They didnt have to say it to your face.
 Not everythings a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. Its those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? Theyre going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
  Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
 Maybe youve got mono.
 Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
 Pam wishes.  Kelly, Ill take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
 I see dead people.
 He was dead the whole time.
 Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
 No! Youll thank me later.
 Hey stranger.
 Sorry. I just feel like we havent talked in awhile.
 When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michaels book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute."
 Yes!
 Whats the plan?
 Can I drive?
 Shotgun!
 Still.
 Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and wont be coming back into the office.
 But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here.
 Christmas card list.
 But when I do, well have something to talk about.
 So, do you know what youre gonna say when he shows up?
 No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, Ill be him, you be you. Lets practice.
  Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
 Yes? What is the meaning of this?
 Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. Its simple dollars and cents.
 Listen, Scott... were losing money, okay? Its not a charity; its a business. And its a dying business.
  Whoa hey, why not?
 Okay.
  Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
  Uh!
 Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids.
  who is it?
 Gonna get it?
 Nothing.
 Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
 My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
 Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
 What were your favorite moments?
 What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
 Well, it doesnt...
||
  Oh my God!
 Stranford is closed! Michael, were not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.
 We did it!
 In your face!
 Oh, man.
 I dont ... have no idea.
 Psh, why is that great?
 What was your mile time?
  I could beat that on a skateboard.
 Yeah, well my feet dont. And I can still crush that time.
 Lets just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
 I am fast. To give you a reference point. Im somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
 Man, what is taking Toby so long?
 And youll compare the times?
 No, my groin...
 ...is really tight.
 I cant...
 Aaaaah!
 Nametag?
 Karen Filippelli.
 Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
 Thats Andy Bernard.
 If I were you...
 ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
 ...before noon...
 ...to consolidate power.
 No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
 The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
 Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
 Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
 Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
 What are you doing?
 I have a smudge on my forehead?
 Why are you looking at my forehead?
 Meet my eye line, Jim!
 Stop acting like an idiot!
 Hello. I dont believe weve been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
 So youll be reporting to me, then.
 My title has Manager in it.
 Oh.
 I know everything about film. Ive seen over 240 of them.
 We need to talk!
 Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
 Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
 Ok. Who reports to who?
 And then if I want...
 I...
 I...
 One...
 Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
 What?
 What?
 But check that its covered by your health care provider!
 But the little cars go in the compact spot
 Do you mean to me? From you? Cause thats how it works.
 Do you have batteries?
 Very funny, Michael!
 Really funny, Michael!
 Do this. Come on. Ready?
 On three. One... two... three.
 Hey, hey. Easy.
 That was my advice. Remember? Im the one who suggested that you fire him.
 And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would none be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
 What!
 YEAH!
 If he even wants it. It doesnt come with a pay raise.
 So who will be your new Number Three?
 And I have to say your leadership...
 has brought...
 Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
 Xterras not even a real word.
 Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
 That makes sense. Id rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
 Well I hope 1985 has a time machine cause I drive an 87.
 Speaking of funerals, why dont you go ahead and go die.
 Idiot!
 If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
  Youre the idiot!
  I was making fun of your comeback! Thats why it worked.  Totally got the best of that interchange.
 I am cool.
 Im cool, Im cool, Im so cool. Tell me what is going on.
 I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
 Prison Mike. Whats the very very worst thing about prison?
 Merry Christmas!
 Dont worry, shes dead. Oh wait. Hes dead.
 I accidentally ran over it. Its a Christmas miracle!
 Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
 Jim.
 What does it look like?
 And circle gets the square.
  So can you watch this? Im gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
 No, Toby, this is different. Hes already dead.
 Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didnt want to see it killed.
 He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
 Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
 Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
 Its Christmas Toby.
 Toby...
  Please? Please?
 Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
  Oh, ouch. Michael, I dont think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
 Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears were one bathrobe short.
  Copy.
  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
 Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. Its riddled with Carols name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
 Why dont you just buy the whole song?
 Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldnt that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
 Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
 As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
 Youre number four.
 Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
 Ok, good
 OK, this is stupid.
 No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee.
 Damn it!
 Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, Im going to need take this chair.
 I cant... I cant here what youre saying.
  Whatre you talking about?
  Carol had a mustache?
  What are you guys talking about?
 Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
 It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if Im here for Michael?
 Who are you calling?
 Looks like youve got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
 Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
 Nah, I dont know... Still think Nakiris better.
 Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
  Start the party.
 Jim! Jim! What... Whats happening?
 Oh... Narcolepsy.
 Oh my gosh, now shes up.
 Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, theres going to be a good amount of blood.  Dont let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
 Hey! Its Angela!  Hey!
 No. It was awful. I couldnt hear anything.
 No... way! Yeah!
 Oh.
 Walkie-talkies.
 Yes!
  Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
  Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
  pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
 Bye Pam.
  What the?  "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?
 Tape recorder.
 For recording. Michael is on vacation and hes asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
 What?
 Im not.
 I do not have a knife!
  Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
 Give me it. I am not.
 Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
 You cant see... You cant see my stomach.
 Whos the target?
 Whats it of?
 Unless youre willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
 OK, I accept it.
  Michael hit a deer?
 Michael! Michael!  Theres an emergency in the warehouse.
 No, its... involves the photograph.
 I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
 There were. A lot of them.
 Who did this to you?  Where is he?
  Its hot in here.
 Yeah.
 I know.  So youre PMSing pretty bad, huh?
 Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
 Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
 Yup?
 Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
 Come on!!
 Uh, yeah. Its the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
 Leave the keys.
 Leave the keys!
 No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
 Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...
 Can I use your phone?
 Thanks.
  One...
 Three...
 Seven...
 Sure.
 Erm, thats one of the Big guys. Been on hold this whole time.
 Here is my card. Its got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I dont celebrate any major holidays.
 I like Karen. Shes pretty and appears intelligent.
 My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
 No thank you.
 Hey, we nailed the sale!
 I overslept. Damn rooster didnt crow.
 I am not a liar.
 Stay out of this, you!
 Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
 Thats what she said.
 Its going to be ok.
 Thats not the worst thing in the world. Ill just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It wont be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
 Well, I dont have a lot of choices.
 Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
 I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
 One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
 I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And its very exciting.
 For your convenience, Ive broken it down into three parts professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
 I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
 How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
 There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
  I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, its fine for the time being. Oops. Breaks over.
  Childs play. Give me something hard to sell.
 Need any help?
 Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
 I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
 Dunder-Mifflin.
  Paper company. Theyre only one of Staples top competitors in the area.
 Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
  Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. Its your funeral. See how that works out for you.
 Hey.
 Same old.
 Oh my God, she told you?
 Accepted.
  The boss isnt funny.
 I dont get to wear my ties.
 So?
 I dont want to do your laundry anymore.
 Thank you.
 You did this for me?
 Oh, man.  No, no, no. I dont need it. Get out!
 How do you know its going to be a boy?
||
 Ow.
 What if hes a murderer?
 Maybe thats how you die.
 I want to do this.
 Action.
 Alright! Uh!
 What?
 Im on it.
 Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
 Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
 I knew you would, Nancy.
 No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
 Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
 Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
 Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
 Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
  Is she hot?  Text back, "Kind of."
 I do!  I want some man meat!
 Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
 We hired you for three hours work and were going to get it.
 Care for a piece of chocolate?
 Who is the king of Austria?
 Who is the king of Prussia?
 Who is the king of England?
 I dont care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
 Are you near sighted or far sighted?
 GAH!!!
 What do you think?
 Okay.
 Sure
 Inbwit? Yes.
||
 I...
 I dont know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
 Hello, Angela.
 You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
 The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
 Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
 No way.
 Of course I saw it.
  I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. Thats the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
 Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I wont have to get her a gift.
 Its a miracle.
 Best of luck, Phyllis. Also Im going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
 Dammit, Phyllis!
 Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
 The bride and groom? What are their names?
 Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Lets move it. Come on. Come on.
 Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
 I cant let you in, Michael.
 No, its Bob and Phyllis orders.
 You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. Im sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
 "Dont be an idiot." Changed my life.
 Whenever Im about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
 ...Oh my God. Animal stool.
 Solving a mystery, if thats quite alright with you.  Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
 BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
 We have... a bat... in the office.
 At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
 What? Whats so wierd?
  This is your job, Halpert.
 No... no. One crisis at a time.
 If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesnt mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
 I dont have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbors dog.
 Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
 --to use sudden violence.
 Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
 Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
 Animal control? Ive been controlling animals since I was six.
 Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
 Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
 Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!
 Hold still, woman!
 ... ... Youre welcome.
 Yes. But this  seems to be...
 I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
||
 Its early bird gets the worm.
 Let me smell.  Good, not great.
 Thanks for inviting me along.
 Hello, Jan.
 Talk to you later, Jan.
 Salad.
 You dressed exactly like the servants.
 Wait. I dont think yours will fit me.
 That would have been really embarrassing.
 Crisis averted.
 Its from both of us.
 Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? Thats feces.
 Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
 No? Then you are an idiot.
 Whats the square footage?
 Does that include the garage?
 Im just...
 Its a common question.
 These old colonials are great, when theyre sound. Id love to take a look around.
 Cool, lets start with the banisters.
 Huh.  Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. Whats in here? .
 Just the one window?
 Are those real pearls?
  Good.
 Oh good, youre up. Hey, who makes this chair?
 I want one. Its got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
 What do you know?
 The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
 Dont break up you guys, youre great together.
 Pam, please call security!
 Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, whos laughing now?
 Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
 Dont want it.
 Dont want it.  Wont open it.  Dont need it.  Wont take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
 No, dont call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
 I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
 Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrators eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
 When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
 No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, whats your angle?
 Whats this?
 Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute"
 Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  Theres a teddy bear in a policemans cap.
 Really?
 Mm, good stuff.
 Sounds... fun.
 No need to thank me.
 I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know whos a real hero?  Hiro, from Heroes.  Thats a hero.  Also, Bono.
 Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which Im looking forward to.  Its an Amish technique.  Its like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
 Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
 Ok, tell him thats not true.
 Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
 Damn you.
 Yeah!
 Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
 Wolves.
 Visual aids.
 A quilt.  Depression quilt?
  Okay, lets do this thing!  Ill go summon the troops!
 We measured it once...
 Seedless?
 Ready?
||
 Okay.
 Got it.
 Were not allowed to use the baler.
 Im on it!
 Im temporarily lifting the shun.
 It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
 Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
 What do you think?  Youve got an hour.
 Shunning resumed.
 Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
 Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
 When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
 Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
 Thats right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  Its rock n roll!
 Yeah!
  Near near near near near!
  Michael is awesome!  Jumpin off the roof!
  Bouncin on the bouncy bounce!  Show em whos boss!
  Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
  Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
  Un-shun.  I think hes suffering from depression. Re-shun.
 Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
 Its gorgeous.  Lets go!
 No really, its, its very nice.  Come on!
 Everybodys gonna be fine in exactly what theyre wearing, lets go!  Lets go!
  Come on, hurry up you guys!
  Michael, whats wrong?!
 Depression?  Isnt that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
 Is that the last year the data was available?
 Dont do anything rash!
 I didnt...  I didnt think you needed them for this part.
 you said to just...
 Okay, Im on it!
 Attention blue collar workers!
 Michaels up on the roof and hes acting strange!
 Michael!  Whats wrong?
 Depressed?  Isnt that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
 Okay, uh... I dont see anything.  She might be bluffing.
 Oh... Its uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, theyre only available in Japan.
 Thats a ridiculous question.
 Well thats debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
 Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
 You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.   Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
 Oh, thats funny.  MICHAEL!
 Cri-Man-Squa?
 Yes!  You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
 Not!
 On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
 First rule in road-side beet sales Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now."  Those are the money beets.
   Hey!   Look sharp!   Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
 And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
 And "Breaking Corporate News."
 Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  Youve been granted level three security clearance.
 Dont get too excited, thats out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
  Great.
 Emergency dentist appointment.
  You look good in this.
 May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
 I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
 Its non-transferable...
 Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
 Im just saying...
 They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
 You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
 Cut.
  Pam.
  Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
 Yeah, thats cause Im... youre boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause youre my girlfriend?
 Im Jim Halpert.
 Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
 That is a demerit.
 Youve gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
  Lets put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
 Three demerits and youll receive a citation.
 Oh, it is serious. Five citations and youre looking at a violation. Four of those and youll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and youre looking at a written warning. Two of those, thatll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
 That is correct.
 Whats a dis... whats that?
  Move!
 Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
 Agreed. Let me show you what Ive been working on.
  There are several penises there Id love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
 Look at that one.
 Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what Im referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
 Answer No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what youre thinking.  Wont that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why dont you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
 Phyllis, sorry. Ive got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
 Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
 Desperate times call for desperate measures.
 Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
  Mm, less than three.
 You know what? Why doesnt Oscar run the meeting? Hes a homosexual.
 Those are collectible action figures and theyre worth more than your car.

 I wish I could menstruate.
 If I could menstruate, I wouldnt have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. Id just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, Id be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
 Have you finished with the sketch?
 Hmm, doesnt seem like the type.
 Hmm.
  I plan on plastering this perverts face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
 Of course you do, moon face. Thats because youre a preppy freak, youre the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
 No, duh. Thats why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
 More like, "Aye, aye, General."
  This is what we
 Yeah, I do. Cause justice never rests.
 No. Wholesies.
 Natch.
 You know, I may have underestimated you. Youre not a total ass.
  Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
 Jim, what are you doing? Im busy.
 Ugh. Im hanging up.
 You have information about the sex predator?
 Where?
  Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm.  PAM!
 OK, where does it hurt?
 No, thats not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
  "Abdomen. Menses."
 "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
 Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
 Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasnt just a trip to the beach.
 I hope there will be management parables.
 Yes!
 I choose Michael!
 OK, temp.
 We will be called Gryffindor.
 Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
 He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldnt do that.
 OK, seriously. You really shouldnt be saying that.
  Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
 What are you saying?
 OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
 I am trying to bring team spirit.
  Lets go! Lets go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard!  What the? Damn it temp!
 Its very good for you.
 Youre leaving?
 Damn it!
 Sabotage.
 No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
 If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
  Gaaaaa....
 Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
 Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
 Thats not why you lost.
 Yeah, right.
  Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
 No! Its okay. I will do this Michael.
  I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
  GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
  Aaagh, aaagh!
 Aggggh, that stings!
 The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"
  I mean truly repulsive acts.
 You wanted to see me?
 But thats my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Dont screw the pooch.   Thank you.
  Thank you, Michael.
  Thank you so much.
  Thank you.
 How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
 No, no, not Michael.  Me. Im taking his job.
  Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
 I am gonna be your new boss.  Its my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
 No. And the sheets are made of fire.
 Sorry, were all booked up. Hell convention in town.
 Ill have to talk to the manager.
 Im the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
 Yeah, but I havent told you my salary yet.
 Eighty thousand dollars a year.
 Once Im officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
 Yes you will.
 Okay, everyone, listen up!   Time to begin the interview process!   Andrew Bernard.
 No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
 What did I say!?
 I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
 Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
 What is the capital of Maine?
 Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Dont wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
 Youre not off to a very good start, Bernard.
  Time! No, you failed.
 This interview is over. Ill let you know.
  Whos ready to work?
 Michael is gone.
 My first order of business make Andrew Bernard my number two.
 As if you had a choice.  Duh.  Opportunity of a lifetime.
 You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
 I had to make Andy my number two.  Its political, complicated, you wouldnt understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
 Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
 Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
 Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This...  is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
 Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
 Listen up.  Lets start... from the ground
 Its like outerspace without the stars, its so black.
 Its so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
 To intimidate my subordinates.
 It was Andys idea.
 Pam, hello.
 I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity.
