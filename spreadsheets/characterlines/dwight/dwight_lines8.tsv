 No, I insist.
 K... Kevin!
 Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but Ive got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. Ive added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, Im doin great.
 K, Im gonna need some help. Pam?
 Hoist him aloft. Cmon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.
 Say no more.
  Kids, dont try planking. Its dangerous.  â€˜Specially with me around.
 What are you looking at?
 It cant be nothing.
  Nice catch.
 Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
  2, 3!
 Okay, which side of the list am I on?
 Yes!
 This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Heres something. Who would eat who in an â€˜Alive situation. No... that cant be it.
 Shhh, Pam. Cmon, dont be such a right-sider.
 No, its not. Heres how we find out. Lets line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Lets just size each other up here and left side of the list ATTACK!
 Thats great. Lets do this guys.
 You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
 Okay!
 Losers.
 Cmon.
 Cmon, cmon.
 Cmon.
 Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
 Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now its over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
 Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
 Good night.
  Man, its like hoisting a manatee. I cant get a grip its so vast.
 God. How do whalers do it?
 Steak. Rare.
 One more. To our boss!
 You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
 I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
 Oh, tips are expected?
 Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
 Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
 Winners!
 This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet.the Pyramid.
 So, you can tell your clients â€œUnleash the power of the pyramid.â€
 Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, its barely three pounds.
 Fifty L.
 Youre really going to want the booster.
 Thank you.
 Is this really the best use of our collective time?
  OK, lets look at some ties.
 Heres how Im going to help out from now on. Im going to not care, and Im going to sit around quietly waiting for Andys inevitable demise.
  Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
 Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie?  Lick the spoon?
 Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just dont see the point. Its so Wall Street.
 Right?
 Good. Really really good.
 Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
 I dont know, what do you mean?
 You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job!  And Ill do mine.. walnuts?
 Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, Im gonna like it.
 DRAW SOME BLOOD!
 ....back orders and you never called them.
 OK, you know what? Im gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy.  Come on.
 There you go! Here doggy! Hes not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
 Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!
 Nein. Sits.  Goot.
 Yeah, thatll work.
 Bye poochie!
 Before taxes.
 I know what youd do with all that money.  â€œHey Pam, lets buy expensive bathrobes and hug.â€
 I think well be fine.
 Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god.  False. Andy, I will volunteer.
 Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!
 Yup.
  Whats the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.
 Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But youre right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
  No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
 Like baboons or elephants.
 Kevin! Doesnt apply.
 Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
 Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
 Kevin Costner.
 Its not the greatest one either...
 And its clear were not going to carry them.
 Exactly.
 Yep. Hell be fine.
 Uh, its not totally empty.
 OK, I can see why youre angry, youre coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
 I dont know.
 OK. You know what? Its been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
 Its uh, its in beta testing.
 Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
 I know. Kevin, weve been friends for a long time, right?
 So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
 I wouldnt be asking you lightly, now would I?
 Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
 Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
 Come on!
  Whats going on?
 Oh, thats funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
 No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!  No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO!  NOOOOOOOOO!
 Schrute Farms is very easy to find, its right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, youve probably gone too far.
 Its simpler this way.
 And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
 They dont warn you when the cameras are driving by.
 Theres so much more to it than that.
 Ive been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, Ive got a secret weapon.  Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.
 MR. RYAN HOWARD!
 STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
 MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
 Set that down.  Present yourself.
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
 Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
 My first love is beet farming, but its a young mans game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
 Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, its still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
 I can get you exotic meats â€“ hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
 Itll all be goat.
 Who cares.
 MR. JAMES HALPERT!
 Stop forgetting things.
 MR. JAMES HALPERT!
 What? Idiot.
 MIS... MI... What are you doing?
 Thats a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
 Erin....the receptionist!
 When all this is over, Id like to actually go to one of Trickingtons parties, they sound like a blast.
 Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo!
 Its called a costume.
 Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
 Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? Its all Tobys fault.
 Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
 Im a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
 Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! Ive been censored.
 Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
 Yeah, but no nipples.
 Its a root you idiot.
 Thats really rude.  I dont tell you hurricanes suck even though its true.
 Try influenza.
 Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricanes coming.  I suppose youre going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
 Yeah Im serious.
 Loser.
 Go, get up there right now.
 You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
  Nice.
 Got em. Go!
 Im a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
 Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
 The city of Atlanta.
  Sorry, go ahead.
 WhaYes. Your attention. Uh because No that is all.
 Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "Were number two!. As with all my dreams, Im guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
 I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project Ive been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
  Allow me. Youre going to love this.  Ughshouldve used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone elses work.
 Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
 Well, I can make this work. Ill set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
 I will do my voodoo.
 The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and youre out.
 Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email youve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
 Roberts favorite songs Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
 P.S. We should should kill him.
 No, its an accountability booster.
 Jim, youre trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
 Smilenod. Smile and nod.
 They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Likenot Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor
 But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
  Oh, theres one mistake.
 Its not a doomsday device, gosh.  We can do this you guys.
 Well, I wouldnt say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look shes hard at work.
 No questions.
 Accountability booster.
 I havent even considered it. Thats how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
 How about Scrantonstrangler666.
 No. Oh shoot. Ha ha haYou guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You wont even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
 Really?
 It goes out automatically at five P.M.
 Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
 No.
 You dont deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
 No you didnt, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine.  What?!
 Hey, you cant just change the rules because you dont like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
 Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
 What?
 Good luck finding a new job idiots. Ill make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
  Oh. Come to reason with me?
 Get lost.
 What does it look like Im doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
 If you hit another horse, youve dug to far.
 In. Im hungry.
 Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
 This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
 Did you just have a stroke, Pam? Its "Nobodys perfect." Nice stroke, Pam.
 I hadnt heard that before, thats, thats funny.
 Any specific animal?
 Dont say cow- Ugh.
 Sive drafely.
 Theyre not my favorite people in the world. I wouldnt even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave youve ever seen.  God, Im gonna have to work with them forever, arent I?
 Hey, Andy.
 Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
 Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
 Andy Im really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
 Oh we know.
 Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what youre saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
 No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
 Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. Thats right. Youre fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
 Thats just absurd.
 Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
 Why would I or anyone else think that youre hot right now? I cant impregnate you, and thats the driving force between male-female attraction.
 Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, youre at an all-time low.
 You think Jims lying?  Thats so cute. I know hes lying.
 Done.  I never touch a pregnant woman.
 If were going to work together, we need some ground rules.
 Rule one our only loyalty is to the truth.
 Rule two we stop at nothing.
 Rule three Dont fall in love.
 Were gonna bust this guy.
 So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
 None taken. What do you got?
 I dont see whats so ugly about him. Hes got the broad face of a brewer.
 Hmm?
 Just ugly enough to have deniability.
 Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he cant lie with his body.
 The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
 With the crotch.
 Psst. Were not here.
 Exactly.
 Okay, just shut it.
 I cant tell. Its unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
 Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
 Time for me to find out.
 Just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, Im slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!
 Im fine, Im totally fine.
 Yes?  Wha- Jim.
 Aw, cramp, Im just-
 Im sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
  Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
 She called it crazy? Aw, man, thats insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
 And she called it nuts?
 Come on.
  Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
 Why dont you go check out the sympathy cards, old man?  Now Im going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
 We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
  Well, thats what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
 Jim, are you serious?
  Okay, youre done.
 Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
 Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
 Yep, hes lying.
 I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, hes lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
 Look at the numbers. Every single time, its come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
 Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
 Its important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
 Its not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
 Doesnt it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
 But... hey, Ceces toothbrush.
 Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
 Ha!
 The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms.  Whatever. Im over it. Its just grossly irresponsible.
 Guess Im a sucker for historical fiction.
 Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when youre talking about D.P.A., thats deaths per acre...
 ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
 Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.  Im telling you, theyre heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
 The truth.
 No, no, no! Youre filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. Im telling the truth.
 Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
 Okay, I will. I dont know who that is, but Im gonna tell you this-
 Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
 Not by a long shot!
 No, it was not!
 No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
 Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
 Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
 Excuse me, I got a question for you.
 Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
 Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
  You said you werent going to look back.
 Really?
 Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
 YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
 Hallowed ground.
 Ive seen enough.
 I know what you guys are all thinking right now Hey, lets go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Jokes on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
 Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesnt hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
 Its not locked, gimme that...
 Its, its latched closed.
  Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
 Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
 Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like youre in a suicide cult.
 Oh yeah?
 Thats right Jim.
  Hey.
 No. Putting a load on more like it.
 Last thing I need is luck.
  Thank you so much.
 What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
 Oh thats real creative.
 I could, but I just dont feel like it loser.
 Standing.
 Dont!
 Standing.
 I know.
 Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
  Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
 Well todays your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrutes Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
 Your path from obesity begins right here!
 Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
 Maybe you do. Hi. Im Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? Its paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
 Its the second easiest job in the world.  Being a mom.
 That is true.
 Thats me.
 Maybe over a beer after shes closed her first sale .
 Ready? What do you think?
 You havent even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke  Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now lets go over membership. Im going to need the first months and the last months up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month
 Darryl...
 Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrutes Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
 Kelly?
 Thats okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
 What do you think youre doing?
 I build you this temple to the human body, and youre lifting what, five pounds?
 I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
 Eight minutes!
 Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?  I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! Im gonna make you look like Lebron James!
 Thats what I said.
 I know.
 This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
 First thing, were gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
 Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
 Youre nothing! Youre so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
 Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
 All right, Ill help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
 No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
 What do you want!?!
 Val Kilmer? I dont buy it. That doesnt make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
 Hey, what are you listening to?
 There is no shower.
 What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
 Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and Ive already covered the BM of it all. Its miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
 What about my wish that we dont have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
 Where? Dark side or light side?
 Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
 Thank you, Andy.
 Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
 I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.
 What is it?
 No, absolutely not.
  Boom!
 Ah! Ive been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
 Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
 Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
 Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
 Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
 You see?
 Might wanna run that by Angela cause its so cute.
 Come down right away!
 Yes, I was quilled.
 Henrietta.
  What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
  Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. Hows it goin?
 Took a little nap right next to Jims desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. Whats everyone staring at?
 Hey. Enjoy your new clump.
 Its so much closer to the bathroom, right?
 Uh huh.
 Youll be fine over there.
 So, I got this bucket from Jims garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I cant wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face.  Dammit Kathy!
 Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I havent managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
 Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
 Im not here to be given anything. Im here to take what is mine.
 Gabe? You dont know?
 Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrels office.
 Robert.
 Yes.
 Very good.
 Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. Youre the bagel guy.
 Meat grinder.
 You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. Youre an American classic.
 But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
 Still an important position. Still a chief.
  Theres no fires within eight miles of here.
 What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COOs office on the phone this instant!
 So its a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
 Oh my God.
 Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
 Whats with the smile?
 And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
 Take me to Robert.
 Take me to his house.
 You know where it is. Lead me there.
 Listen, youre a perfectly fine toilet. Im just an extraordinary piece of crap. Lets go.
 Which one is it?
 Robert! Robert California! Robert!
 No thank you.
 Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible?
 Yes, exactly. Riddle number two Who is going-
 N... its complicated.
 Its a job interview, not a flea market.
 Yes.
 Oh, ugh.  What is this, a meatball? Really?
 Jim, come on! Thats so juvenile! What the-
 Ugh.
 Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim.
  Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
 Thirty-two meatballs.
 That idiots been feeding us for a week.
 Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
 What-
 Im relaxing. Scram.
 Oh really?
 Yeah, you want to play you little hick?
  You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
 Im not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because Im mighty? Because Im the manliest man in the office? Ill do it.
 You stop.
 No, you stop.
 Okay, you can stop.
 No, you can stop.
  Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, thats so good. Ah...
 Damn it.
 We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
 Chicken fight!
 Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
 Yeah- oh!
 Woohoo! Yes!
 I know. I could just bang you right now.
  Maybe we should take a little break.
 Okay.
 Go!
  Erin, did we win?
 Youre lying. We didnt win.
 Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phylliss birthday.
 I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isnt she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I dont want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
 So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
 Not what I asked.
 So then you wont mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
  Youre an idiot.
 Uh huh.
 Yeah....baby.
 Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
 No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. Its like the devils cursive.
 Youd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...
  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
 Yeah...
 Ready?
 RAHHH!!!!!!!
 Get her! Ruin her!
 Cant believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
 Of course you found him not guilty.  "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."
 Not coming, have plans.
 I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking Id won a walk-on part on NCIS, but thats not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
 So this whole hit and run thing, theres just one part I cant figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
 And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
 See, thats what Im having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.  Busted, Halpert!
 Yes! Andy, get out here.
 I am making a citizens arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwights rights.
 Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I dont know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
 I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
 I dont- I dont need to take a chill pill.
 I really dont want to take the chill pill.
 Okay, okay.  But lets just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
 Thats good enough for me.
 Okay, everybody, gather round. Got a real special surprise for you.
 Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
 No, Toby!  Damn it, Toby! No, I wasnt asking you.  Ask him if he remembers Jim.
 He says, "No!" Boom!
 Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
 Great. And while were enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why dont you tell us your story again?
 Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
 Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jims house, and then back to the courthouse?
  Youre screwed! Oh, its happening. Its really happening.
 Your clients. Theyre all mine.
 All right, well. Lets get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand.  Here we are. So long, clump-mate. Im going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But youve defeated yourself.
 No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
 Thats it? This is crap!
 Gabe, its Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
 Im gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best stickle.
 Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
 Okay.
 Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
 So dont.
 What?
 How long before?
 Yes I did.
 I want to see the baby.
 Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions...  willingly, or as slaves.
 That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
 Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
 Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
 Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
 You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
 -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "Id like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
 And then I inserted my penis-
 Into your-
 Vagina and-
 Admit that there is a chance.
 Admit it. Admit it.
 Yeah.
 Before I go, may I?
 Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
 I just might be his father.
 Oh, right.  The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
 Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
 Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like theyre raising us. Am I right?
 I have a recurring nightmare that Ive been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phylliss name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that Ive been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women.
 What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
 What?
 You cant tantalize me.
 OK.
 If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
 Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
 The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a mans life perfectly Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, â€œperfect pork anusâ€ which I dont mean.
 Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where Im going to be living for the next three weeks.
 Mm hm.
 Eh! No plus ones. This is for competent workers only. And dont worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
 God, youre such a spy.
 My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People wholl help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who wont be missed. We dont need idiots, good for nothings, methheads or... Whats your name?
 Kathy.
 Yes.
 Oh my god.
 Are you kidding me?! Im supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? Wed never get off the runway.
 Oh god.
 Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
 May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
 Oh, no big deal. Its just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
 Oh, Im sorry Stanley, I cant share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
 I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. Im sure he had his reasons.
 I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
 Good point. But were gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that its gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
 It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But theres an easy way to find out.  Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
 Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they werent picked and maybe you could just clarify?
 Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
 OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
 Great idea! So why doesnt everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
 Three to four hours.
 Two to three hours...
 Come up with a statement in the next hour....
 I have already picked my team Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. Whats that? Its not up to me? I only have influence? Well, thats all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
 Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
 Ok. Thank you Kevin, well let you know.
 Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
 Maybe its what she does here...
 You know I dont think its a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
 Well,  No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
 I wouldnt say that...its a bit much.
 Jim is essential to th-
 Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
 This is stupid! Cut.
 He doesnt even want to go.
 Oh my god.
 What?
 No.
 No!
 (Bleep)
 Youve gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team.  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
 Lets go, step it up you runts. You infants, lets move.
 Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable youve ever faced. Theyre gonna be hard, theyre gonna be dirty. Youre gonna wish you were dead.
 But? Theres not buts. Thats it. Youll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
 Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
 SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DONT WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
 How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
 I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When Im done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.
 Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says â€œIm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblattâ€ unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husbands colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-,  oh. What was that?
  Orientation is over.
 Ok, Florida team, lets reconvene.
 So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while were at corporate.
 Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
 It did, it did.
 Oh, I like it.
 No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
  Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
 I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, thats not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
 Today is the first day of Sabres new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... Were already twenty minutes late.
 Wake up!
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up!  Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
 Stanley! Wake up! Youve got to wake up, the hotels on fire!
  Good morning.
 Heeeeres Dwi- what the-?  Oh man.
 Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples.  Oh no, no, no, no. It wasnt me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.
 Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
 I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then Ive loved working with Pam and shes frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
 Ill have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesnt acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
 Power.
 Okay, Twiggy, thats enough. Get in the car.
 Im fine, okay? Its just stress. You know, cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
 Very funny, Jim.
 Im gonna set your face on fire.
 Packer.
 Uh.
 You didnt poison me, its just stress.
 What is the antidote?
 Ill do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now youll never be able to get that out of your head.
 Mmm!  There we go.
  Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, its tender. It cant be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you dont know? Hold on.  What kind of poison did you use?
 Yeah, Im gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone.  Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? Theres no name listed.
 Send it to the frickin moon, idiot.
 You talking about hunting? I love hunting. Im a master hunter.
 Im a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, thats a master baiter.
 Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, lets get back to work! Breaks over!
 Ill be on top. Its the most important position.
  Ahh!
 Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like Im gonna vomit!
  Stop moving!
 Oh!
 Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
 Dont remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
  Phillip, if youre hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, Im dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you.  Mose, hey, its Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
 I just got out of surgery. Whats going on? Fill me in.
 Whos doing the presentations?
 Damn it!
 Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
 Im great. How are you?
 Whats our presentation about?
 I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
 No, I dont feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
 I want that vice-presidency.
 "Youre too slow, youre too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. Im going to do it.
 All right, whos ready for the next presentation?
 What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
 Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is...  The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do.  Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
 Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
 No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a womans only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.  Thank you.  Oh, God. Next slide.
 Andersons three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
 Ingredients.
 Burgers.
 Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Andersons three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwights pillars, and there is only one desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room Im not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
 Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
 Oops. Thats embarrassing. Egg on my face.  Ah.
 Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
  Oh God.
 Youre not paying me to heal, youre paying me to kick ass.
 Thats right.
 Ah! Not so fast.
 Ill go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
 I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
 Pretty good.
  Thats not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, youve got so much on your plate. Right now, youre like oh, whats more important? Dwights question, figure out whos the VP? Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
 Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
 Thats a hobby, unless its for food.
 Waste of time.
 Thats just a verb.
 Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
 English peoples main use today is judging American talent.  Youre crap. Youre wonderful.  Theyre mean, but theyre incisive.
 Genghis Khan could take em both down cause hes not afraid to kill children  What? its true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
 Thats a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
 Oh, you get kicked.
 (takes out bag) 40. Always.
 Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
 No, theyre not transferrable just cause I handed em to you.
 Aah!
 Hey. I see what youre doing. Its futile. the VP position is mine.
 Well, saddles   sometimes fall off, especially if you dont properly cinch the girth.
 If anyones having sex with Nellie for personal gain, its me, and Im not joking at all. If you dont tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
 You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree?  ahhmmm excuse me What?! Not now, Im busy.
 Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no Freak, I need a favor.
 I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
 You really want Packer as your boss?
 If Jim has bedbugs, that means theyre everywhere. I cant risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
 Where did you see it?
 We gotta find it before it eggs.
 Describe it.
 Could be a bat weevil Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
 Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
 Pshh. Thats a bedbug.
 Everythings a joke.
 Check your hair!
 God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
 You are clean. Okay One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide  I am going to generate myself into a human trap.  When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then well see whos laughing.
 Yeah.  Cover me!
 Let the bedbugs bite!
 We wait.  Come to papa.
 Okay Seven, one, one, nine
 No, okay.
 Try again Ugh, Im still getting numbers! Seven, one, one is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? Cause please stop, okay?
 Wait, the numbers!
 oh
 There you go.
 Seven minutes.  Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. .
  Win at all costs, dont respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, thats how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
 Second best Bananas Foster Ive ever had.
  Dont let-shh!
 Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR  and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
 Yes.
 Yes. Yes.
 We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
 Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
 Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
 Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. Youre gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a worlds fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
 Okay.
 Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
 Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
 Perfect casting, right?
 Speaking of pimples, lets release the BLOGGERS!
 Open the gates! Theres plenty for everyone. No need to panic. Theres plenty for everyone!
 Theres plenty. Dont stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
 Okay, okay. Hey, hey. Its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. Theres plenty of Pyramids.
 Oh, no, no, no. Its good. Its really -- on the Internet, its a really -- thats a really good, good, thing.
 Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
 You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Â Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
 Point it towards the store, idiot!
  You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
 Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
 Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
 But you still work for Wired, right?
 Good! Okay. Flirt away.
 Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
 You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
 Im trying to make him feel important.
 Um...  Oh, Ryan, youre so smart. Youre smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
 Whats a book?
 Jim, get him a water.
 Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
 Have you seen Erin?
 Oh God... Â Hey no! Where do you think youre going? Youve gotta stay for the big presentation weve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. Hes like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
 Its moments away. Just stay here!
 How long has he been in the bathroom?
 Jeez! Whats he doing in there?
 Are there any bloggers around?
 I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
 Thats right. Will you just give us a second?
 Jim --
 Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. Im telling you... if you dont do this,  I dont stand a chance. Please, Jim.
 Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryans costume and check out his notes.
 Of course theres a costume!  Â Oh, this is gonna be great. Theres nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
 Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
 Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
 You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
 Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. Â We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
 Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
 Okay! Come on!
 Hah! Yah!  Boom!
  A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I dont know that its poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, Im glad hes OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another mans treasure and all. Wow!
  Well, mister ball, its been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!
 Ah!
  You think youre excited? You should feel my nipples.
  Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, thats so thoughtful.  Four!  Oh yeah!
 Dont even care!
 Well, Jim, I just want to say that we havent always got along and at times, Ive even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win.
  Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemens bet. Woohoo!
  Robert! Im gonna win, ha ha, Im the gentleman! Suck it!
  The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre   to the power of two.
  I told you.
 You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. Its gonna make some really good toilet paper.
 What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
 What, your stylist ran out of messy spray?
 You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.
  Silence.
  I know what youre trying to do, I dont want it.  But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
 Different guy.
  That you look like the worlds tallest hobbit.
  Showtime.
 You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. Youre like an Amish return stick.
 Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
  Jim, come on.
 Uh-huh.
 Wait.  Hes gonna kill the store? And hes gonna fire me?
  Thats two things.
 Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and theyre not going to work today.
 You know what? You might want to get to the airport. Its gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
 Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if youll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, shes a slu- Ah!
  Help! Help!
 AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
  Ah!
  Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
 My wound hasnt healed yet.
 Oh, man!
  Rrrah!
  Huh, huh, huh!
 I was trying to go-
 Ok, ok.
 Then you know what? Im just gonna have to run right through you.
  Jackie Chan!
 This. Ends. Now.
  Rrahh!
 Anything else you need to talk about?
  Once again, its show time.
 My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
 Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.
 Right here.
 What?
 How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. Im in an identical situation.
 I wouldnt let her manage a celery farm.
 Those who cant farm, farm celery.
 I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
 What?
 Theres no limit to what I think I deserve.
 Five percent. No less.
 Six percent, I know my worth.
 Money isnt real ever since we got off the gold standard.
 No, you know what? Nellies right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes. Yes, sorry too late. Im here. This is mine. Back off.
  Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
  Well fought. I accept the outcome.
 Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
 Yep.
  Yes!
 Okay, okay.
 Why Jim?
  Ugh! Ow.
 Dont listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think Ill just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."
 I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
  Haulin cube!
 I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
  Ooh.
 I have to see these shoes.
 Oh!
 Heres the two of them taking a hike. Im guessing hes some kind of friend.
 Heres the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. Im guessing hes some kind of close romantic friend.
 You read my mind.
 Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- hes a hated Italian politician.
 Why not call...
 Thats awful. What kind of restaurant.
 If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
 Okay scram, wizard.
 You heard me!
 Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
 Ive written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
 Yes?
 How?
 Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
 Okay?
 Washington Monument.
 Eiffel Tower.
 One of Tobys eyes is getting smaller. So theres that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So Ill keep you posted on that.
 Every day I brief Nellie on whats going on in the office. Most of its irrelevant. But a good informer doesnt judge whats worth passing on.
 Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
 Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew youd win, but you just demolished him! Im a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
 Its not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
 No, no, no, no, no, Its not me. Im gonna prove it right here and now.
 Yeah Jim.
 You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
 You dont like the Beatles?
 Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
 I dont want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
 There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
 Thats how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
 I dont even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. Im going up to the roof.  And Im gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
  Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22  If youre going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
 You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
  How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
 Its $475! Like candy from a baby!
  Yes! Thank you!
  Oh yes! Yeah!
  Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
 Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
 Thank you. Wow, I cant tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets remember we are all here for the dog society. Hes whats important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!
 Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why dont you just take estrogen?   There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you?  Mwah.
 Oh, I bet you think its all about core, huh?
 Oh, please.
 Feast on this, Lewis.
 Oh, thank you.
 Very funny Jim.
 I dont need your help.
 Here, here Just
 Good, we have a deal?
 Thanks so much Earl.
 And they said it couldnt be done. Boom!
 Yeah, and were not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
 No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
 Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
 Yes.
  There he is. Thats Lloyd.
 Thats true.
 Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I couldve choked so many people by now.
 Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jims leg.
 Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
 Dont listen to him.
 Nope.
