  From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
  No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
   There. Take those home to your wife.
  Michael, its time.
  Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
  Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you cant swallow.
  Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
  Family only.
||
  Fax this for me.
  Its not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim.  If I dont see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, Ill see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
   Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
  Monkey.
  Lets do this thing.
  OK, can you turn the girl off please? Im trying to get some work done.
  Come on, Bernard.
  All right, were set.
  Shotgun weddings.
  Obesity-caused illnesses.
  Michael, we have a situation.
  They should not be in that room.
  Yeah!
  Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
  Partys over. You are so busted!
  Happy Birthday, Stanley!
  Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.    And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
  I am hardly the problem, Jim.
  This is what Im gonna do.  Im gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
  Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  Im really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
  But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but its a two man job.  Interested?
   Sixty - forty.  Hm?   Ill drive.
  Hey, hey!
  And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!
  Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?    You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
  No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, Ill sit on you!"
  Vamping.
  Eh, Ive been sitting all day.
  She should thank me.
   I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
  We better.
  Yes, you do.
  I do not!  I do not say "Hi" Pam!
  What are you writing about me?
  Im gonna write you both up for not working.
  Ok, well played.  Neither of usll write the other up for not working.
||
  God.  Where is Jim?
  What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  Youre late.
  Dripping on me.
  Shes not a virgin, you know.
  I got it, I got it.
 Yes.
 What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
 Its a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, its not your real family.  Youve been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
 Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
 Never!
 What are you doing?
 Oh, so wait a minute, youre going to time me every time I yawn?  Thats absurd.  Really?  Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  Hes ti---
 There is no way that that was---
 Ok.
 None of your business.
  Fine.
 Yes, maybe Im not.
  Hey Michael?
 Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
 My cervix is ripening.
 Michael! My waters breaking!
 Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
 Right. Highways or surface roads?
 No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
 Its about adapting to the circumstances.
 No. OK, no.  Im crowning!  Im crowning!  Aaaaaaaa!
 The pressure!  The pressure!
 Aaaaaaaa!
 Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
  Hold me!
 Cradle my head!
 Im screaming, Im screaming, Im screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
 Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
 No! I dont want natural!
 OK!
 Aaaaaaaa!
 Do you have the Sharpie?!
 Do you have the Sharpie?!
 OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
 Ready?!
 Aaaaaaaa!
 Butter. Newborns are slippery.
 Whos Sarah Kayacombsen?
 Oh no...
 Jan had the baby and Michael wasnt there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybodys.  Except Michaels.
 Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
 Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
  Dont hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
  Dont get stuck on the barbed wire!
  Playtime is over!
 I like to call this... the bumper test.
 Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
  You set a date?
 A knife.
 You got a better way?
 About what?
 I know none of that. If I did, youd be the last to know.
 She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
 I was talking to myself.
 I just dont get it.
 Why is she marrying Andy?
 Thats really fattening.
 Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And thats all we have.
  Ugh.
 Get in.
 I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
 Are you sure thats going to work?
 Wait, this isnt our floor. Dwight...
 Listen to me close. Cause Im only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
 I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 614 PM. 614!
 Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
 I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.
 Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
 Okay, fine. Ive moved on. Now how do I get her back?
 Wait, thats it? Thats your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
 Oh. I get it. Youre trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. Youre just being selfish.  And you slap like a girl.
 What did Phyllis do wrong? Ill tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.
 300 and one penny.
 350 and one penny.
 400 and one penny.
 500 and one penny.
 700 and one penny.
 Eh, its not worth it.
  Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! Im gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh!  Disappear.
 Good morning temp.
 Thought Id go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
 Andy.
 No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, Im applying!
 Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
 I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
 Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.
 Hey there. So uh, how do you think were gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Fords arm looks pretty strong.
 Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldnt have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
 Someday, well both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
 Excuse me?
  Andy, lets just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
 What do you say?
 Andy, Ive been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Gos?
 Thats a conflict of interest.
  Interview.
 What?
 Okay.
 Bring it.
 Dale Raymond Corson!
 Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
 On the contrary, Im helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
 Well, when they get my evaluation well see if theyre interested.
 "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
 "Interviewer has suspect motives."
 "Interviewer has turned off applicants interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
 And you will be hearing from the -
 -Cornell Application Department,
 And you will not be pleased with the result.
 And your affiliation with Cornell -
 Will end completely!
  That is all sir, you may go.
 Where did you get those?
 I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
  Cornell.
 I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
 Oh, nothing can hurt you now. Youre a man in love!
 Bring it on.
 Sorry.
 What does it say?
 Thats impossible.
 I sell more paper than anyone.
 Wait, is this a joke? Im getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
 No, but thats sometimes part of it.
 Impossible to say. I cant see myself.
 What are you mumbling about?
 None of your business.
 Those cant be my scores, Jim. For your information --
 Im being sabotaged.
 And Im going to find that person and punish them.
 Youre an idiot.
 No way.
 I didnt say anything
 What do you think I am saying to you?!
 Ive caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
 All right, fine.  Brrring.
 Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
 Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
 What is your name, sir?
 Really, thats your real name?
 Yes, Michael.
 What? No, but I --
 Oh, no. Whats wrong?
 Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, were having a limited--
 OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
 OK, our prices have never been lower.
 ...never been lower!
  Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
 He --
 Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
 Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
 I have to put you on with my boss.
  Yeah!
 You are the master.
 Dont do it, Michael.
 Get in!
 Get in!
 Shh.  They might be listening to us.
 They might be listening to us
 Customer service might be monitoring this conversation.
 You never know. Better safe than sorry.
 Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
 Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and theres little evidence of that.
 I dont know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
 Who are you talking to?
 Shes not here, Jim.
 Wait, shut up.
 Shh. Do you hear that?
 Breathing. Is that you?
 Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Whos there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.
  Ha!
 Hear anything interesting?
  I think you know.
 What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
 Of course I am. I know youre the mastermind, but youre too stupid to do it by yourself.
  Ah!
 OK.
 The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didnt! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know youre involved.
 No.
 No. Why? No.
 Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
 Obviously. I knew it.
 Yeah. What?
 I was -- I was right.
 I was right.
 I knew it.
 I knew it the whole time, buddy!
 Yeah! Woo-hoo!
 I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo!  Boom! Kelly the whole time. Lets get her.
 Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
 Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
 We have our confession. Im calling security.
 I want to be here when you fire her ass.
 Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The worlds tiniest Bluetooth?  May I?
 Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
 Well, then. Why dont you look over some of our materials?
  While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications.  I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal.  Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
 While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
 OK.
 You already said deal.
 Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
 Do you have your money belt?
 No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
 Here, let me help you.
 Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
||
  Who is that monkey?
 Know what?
 Oh, well, doesnt surprise me.
 Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
 What? Are there two suns?
 Last I checked, thats not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
 Its totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
 Youre back.
 Good. I need you to make five copies of these.
 Alright. First thing in the morning then.
 Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, Ill stick with my jerkie.
 To socialize.  And inform.
 He looks great.
 Well rested.
 Also, its icky back there.
 Okay, fireable offenses include workplace violence and sexual harassment.
 I love catching people in the act.  Thats why I always whip open doors.
 Okay
  I am the bait.
 Men find me desirable.
 Oh, its a good day too. Im wearing my mustard shirt.
 Mmhmm.
 Men find me desirable.
 Those are fighting words.
 I hope he doesnt haul off and just hit you.
 Hmmm?
 Come on.  Baaah!
 Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
 Ryan.  Come on, man?
 Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
 Are you really not going to punch him?
 I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
 Theres still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
  Frame him, for using drugs.
 Yeah, its illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
 Oh Ive framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
  Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson  and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, thats my name.  See you soon.
 Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriffs Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
 Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
 Search his things.
 They dont need your permission, Flenderson, theyve got the companys permission.
 Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
 No! Michael, no!
 So wait a minute, theres no drugs?
 Gahh, dammit!  Come on!
 Wait, officers, are you sure you dont want to interrogate him?
  You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why dont you use them?
 What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffanys at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  Its priceless.  As Im taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  Its her fathers business.  Shes Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I dont trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and hes the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  Shes been waiting for me all these years; shes never taken another lover.  I dont care, I dont show up. I go to Berlin.  Thats where I stashed the chandelier.
 Yeah, do tell.
 Mmhmm.
 How could it be more clear?
 Okay.
 Well dig a trench. As long as its downhill from the well, we should be fine.
 Well were not gonna put out stumps, come on.
 This is where youll have your receiving line. Of course well clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
 Youre gonna need to be more specific.
 Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
 You wanna eat, dont you?
 ...Ill consider it.
 Theres a hose out back.
 Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
 Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. Its not that hard.
 Cats dont make butter.
 It doesnt make any sense.
 Cow, goat or sheep.
 Heres another place.
 So... why dont we try this out, well see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angelas father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when youre up here.
 He doesnt understand a word youre saying.
 Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad...  And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. Hes explaining why were here, what were doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then hes gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. Hes gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then hes going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do."  And then hes going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
 And there we go. Okay, and thats just about it. Man and wife.
 I know you did. And thats why I have taken care of everything.
 Well Monkey, hes a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasnt signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
 Yes, of course it does.
 It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
 Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
 Wha...
 My... Its not my fault you dont understand German; Ive been telling you to take it for years!
 What is this?
 Youre so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
  Yeah, no such thing.  They dont give out black belts for things that are stupid.   Well, I hope it was worth it, cause Im gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
 Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --
 These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
  Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year its a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase "My horn can pierce the sky".  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isnt that right princess?
 I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
 They are now.
 All right.
 Oh, so glad I could help.
 Merry Christmas.
 Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
 We got a live one!  On fire!!
 Aye.
 No, I like Meredith.
  Actually, I dont care for Meredith, but I dont believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.  Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
 I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
 There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
 Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
 She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
 I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
 Oh right, thatll take a couple of weeks.
 Really?
 $200.
 Oh, thats my last one.
 Not my problem.
 Well dont look so surprised.
  Aah!
 Yes!
 I was just jogging.
 Wait, what?  You cant take what?
 No. You cant do that. It shouldnt come from you.
  Seems like you already know where.
  Trade seats with me.
 Ive got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
  I need a soup spoon.
 Rule 17 dont turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five.  Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you dont, youll be eaten in your sleep.
||
 Youve got to tell Andy about us.
 Get it over with. Then we dont have to hide anymore.
 Do you love me or not?
 Because youre engaged to Andy.
 Not yet.
 Angela said she was going to tell him. Shes just not ready.
 I dont know.
  Yes.
 Eager.
 And flexible.
 Michael, once this gets out... I dont know how its going to go down.
 Might get ugly.
  Have a good trip.
 If Im sitting, I cant disable his neck or his groin.
 If Im sitting, I dont have the option to.
 Andy.
 Oh good. She broke up with you.
 Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
 No I dont.
  Well I dont know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
 Will never be her name.
 I dont think so.
 And Im telling you that I will never back down.
 Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
 That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
 Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
 Fine!
 What is your weapon?
 Hey, this is none of your business.
 Yes!
 Outside of work.
 None of your business then.  Good. So what weapon?
 That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
 I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
 Mm.
  Howd that get there?
  Come on! Where are you? Lets do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
 Come on!
 Where are you?
 Come on, coward! Where are you? Where...  "From the desk of Andrew Bernard."  A note. Pathetic. "Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested." True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..."
  Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
 Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
 Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
 Never!  Get out and face me like a man!
 Youre not a man! You dont know how to take care of her!  All you do is dress fancy and sing.  "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You cant even protect her!
 Last year, idiot!
 No. My right ones falling asleep a little bit.
 Yeah, back off. This isnt your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost?  Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!
 I sa-
 Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
 What?
 Shes sleeping with you?
 She said she was only sleeping with me.
||
||
 Whats this?
 Hmm. It wasnt here before.
 Yours doesnt.
 No, its going in a different direction then the other wires.
  What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
 No, I wanna seduce her.
 Please Michael, please.
 Youll fall in love with her.
 Okay, lets go over the plan again.
 Your fictitious name?
 I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
 Then we meet at the Dennys...
 ...and then we compare notes.
 No!
 You know how I feel about IHOP.
 Are you socialist?
 Ill have a cup of a coffee.
 Store only has three employees.
 It means they are not expanding.
 No.
 No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
  Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
 Which Means theyre not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
 Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
 Get your clouds right.
 So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it.  No, no like this.  Good.
 Yeah.
 Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
 Why dont you just get rid of this guy?
 Im your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, Im a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  Im the top salesman there and Im looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
 Pshaw, thats nothing. Ive 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
 Me too.
 My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.
 Its going very well.
  Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.
 Cmon.
 All their top clients I cant believe it.
 Someones looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.
 You drove over that. Go back
 Thats not good.
 Oh my God.
 Oh man,
 Not good.
 Yeah.
 Youve done more then you can possibly know.
 He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
 How much longer is this going to take?
 This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
 I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
 Goodbye prince family,  should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while Im at it.  Bye bye.
||
 Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
 They could do better.
 What?
 Im not familiar with that expression,
 It doesnt make sense, of course Im alive.
 Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
 Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we dont do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
 There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadnt destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
 Yeah.
 Good, so,  where are you going?
 Where are you taking the client list?
 Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, dont do this. No.
 Freeze, give me the list!
 No no no, I cant let you do this!
 Its business, not personal.
 Its over, Michael, its over.
 Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
 Last week I gave a fire safety talk.  And nobody paid any attention.  Its my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.   Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
   Does anyone smell anything smoky?
||
  Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  Whats the procedure?  What do we do, people?
 Oh, how did that happen?
 No, we dont know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
 Whats the procedure, everyone? Whats the procedure?
 Wait, wait, wait.
 No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If its hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
 Not a viable option.
 Okay, whats next?
 Oh! Heres a door.  Check that one out. Hows the handle?
 Well, uh, another option.
 Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
 Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
 Okay, lets go.
 Calm, please
 Have you ever seen a burn victim?
 Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
 A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Lets remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, thats the wrong way.  Weve already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
 Whats next?
 How about 911?  Anyone? 911.
 Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
  Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
 Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise.  So, what have we learned?   Oh come on.  Its not real Stanley. Dont have a heart attack.
 A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
 Shampoo.
 I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
 Yes I shouted "fire!".  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
 When no one hedded--
 N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
 So, you--
 And, well, I dont see my co-workers--
 Hee-heeding this right now.
 No.
 PETA.
 Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely.  It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. Whats the matter? You hungry?
 Dont you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
 I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
 What? You?
 Come on.
 Thats preposterous.
 This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
 Absolutely I would not.
 Okay, hes dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
 Anyone else?
  Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
 He is.
 Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.  Here we go.
 We search for the organs. Wheres the heart? The precious heart.
 Clarice?
 I didnt think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, its pretty realistic.
 Wow.
 I have.
  "I state my regret."
 I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. Its not a big deal.
 Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
 Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
 Speaking of which...
 May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
 That was the last signature I needed.
 How dare you all attack him like this.
 Michael is your superior.
 Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
 Ok, no, they dont understand who they have...
 Youre interrupting me. Im trying to get your back.
 Are you calling me an idiot?
 Dont you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You dont have any friends, or any family, or any land.
 Its very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? Hes either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And hes like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
 Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
 Oh, thats quite a leap Pam.
  Got it.
 Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
 Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
 Go ahead, you do it.
 I insist.
 What he said was...
 ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
  I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating.  Thats on my side.
 If you say screw you one more time...
 Hey, HEY.
 Oh God.
 What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
 Well, Im not done yet.
 They match the carpet
 Its a statement of fact.
 This is more professional. Its not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
 Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal mans.
 Have you collected the money from everyone?
 How much do you have?
  Thats how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
||
  Damn it!  Dwight Schrute.
 Who is this?
 Mose doesnt know how to use a phone. So jokes on you.
 Uh, 24. 37.
  Ill call you back.
 I have here Kelly Kapoors personal and confidental file. Allow me to share.   "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."  Blah, Blah, Blah.
  What did you do?
 What did you do?
 What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
 Why dont you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
 In juvie.
 Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
 For reha-
 What did you do? Huh?
 Yeah, if shes old enough to get married, shes old enough to follow the law.  What did you do?
 I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
 Frosting.
 Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
 Busy!
 Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
 You know what? Im a little busy.
 Its not effeminate. Its festive.
  You have to write my suggestions down, too.
 Its in the name.
 Youre right, forget horse hunting. Its stupid.
 Heres one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like Id never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.
 Schrutes dont celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year.  What about you?
 Thats cool. Hey, you know whats even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
 Hey, its not a surprise.
 Told you.
 Our theme, if you will.
 Thats our theme.
  Oh, yes! Okay, good. So whats it gonna be, Kapoor?
 No.
 Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! Were gonna be eating cake at our desks. Lets go.
 Move it! Lets go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
  Okay, youve got one hour.
 Mm, great cake.
  Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.  Many happy returns.
  Ayyyy!
 So sexy it becomes hostile.
 Yeah, deal with it Pam!
 Having trouble finding a vein?
 How about now?
 I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself.
 Youre right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
 A net? a giant net?
 What do you have in mind?
 Oh God, thats a terrible idea.
 No.
 Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, youre not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  Youre like the guy who invented the seat belt.
 Hey.  No movement.
 Eh, its not that early.
 Im ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
 Oh.  Meh.
 Eh.
 Hello.
 Dwight K. Schrute. Why dont you introduce me to your little friend?   Hi, Dwight.
 I can untie any knot.  Im serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
 You shouldnt believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
 You must use a lot of paper.
 ...and the kind of discounts were talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
 Is somebody after you?
 Hey, it just takes one!
 Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just dont add up.
 So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
 OK, whats up?
 Oh-oh-oh before you go, Id just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
 OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
 Thanks, Michael.
 I got a knock-knock joke.
 OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
  Knock, knock.
 KGB.
  We will ask the questions!
 What are you doing?
 Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
 Cmon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
 Im not answering it.
 No way, its the KGB.
 Im not answering that. You answer it.
 Im not gonna answer it, its the KGB.
 Its true.
 That was your idea.
 You did. Several times. Over and over again.
  You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
 Wasnt my idea. Loved - but I cant.
 You dont keep a diary.
 Hold that thought.   March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
 To keep secrets from my computer.
 Impossible.
 I wasnt given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we werent allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
 Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasnt mine. Discussed movies.
 With all my heart.
 OK, what am I thinking right now?
 No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
 Oh, not gonna happen.
 I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Wont happen again.
 What about Shoe La La?
 I love working here and I do not want to leave.
 Well...
 We discussed the fact that Im cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
 No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
 Try me.
 I havent made a decision yet.
 No.
 He said he would do the same for me.
 Im gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
 David... youre welcome.
 Thats what she said!
 Inspiration.
  You never know when its gonna strike. Just... boom.
 Apology rejected.
 Oh Pam.
 Thanks old man.
 Yeah.
  Cause Ive got this idea...
 Alright.
 OK guys, listen up. Heres the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment its metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
 So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that thats where I cam up with that idea .
 Pam...
 That is my idea.
 It is my idea.
 It is my idea. Im filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
 Horse Boat.
 A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
 Oh give me a break.
 Thats because theyre easy!
  Womens urinals... uh...
 Yes, its Michaels idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
 Oh I am. In my own words.
 No.
 No, Michael.
 No!
 Ding dong.
 KGB.
  When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
 We have more houses to visit.
 We will come back at... how is  445?
 How about 515?
 Very well, we will come back at 515.
  Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
  Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
  Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
  Michael, youre just agreeing with him because hes wearing a tux. Dont you see what hes doing here?
  Oh, heres one  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music.
  Mr. Peanut is not classy.
  He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
  Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
  Well, Im sorry, I just dont know what classy is then.
  I said that!
  Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvanias largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
  Well finish it up later, but essentially what were talking about is...
  What about your party?
  Ask him about the party.
  No the other thing.
  He hung up?
  Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm em.
  Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
  Hows it hanging?
  Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, Ive got David Wallaces son in the trunk of my car. If he doesnt get on this phone in 5 seconds-
  Excellent.
  Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
   Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
  Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
  Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
  My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
  Your own paper company.
   Right...
  What a courageous venture.
  Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
  Okay. So yeah.
  You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
  No.
 Hustle!
 Way to go.
 What?
 This is how I breathe.
 If you want to tell me -
 Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh!
 Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. Cause you never, ever talk about it.
 Wow.
 You can be so modest sometimes.
  Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
 Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
 Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
 I dont try and be anything that Im not.
 Jim, what do you say?
 Game on!
 Wing.
 Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
 Let me check.  Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
 Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
 You know theres a ghost in this office
 A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
  Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
 Yeah isnt it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
 It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
 That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that youre next.
 Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
 Yeah?
 Erin  Erin...
 Hey buddy.
 Hey buddy, what are you up to?
 Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and Im assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
 Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
 And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
 No no no.
 Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just,  Boom.
 Youre good.
 Oh its good, youre coming along. Its really technically proficient but really theres no heart or soul in it.
 Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
 In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
 Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
 Cherry Pie, Warrant.
 No! Really?
 Enter Sandman, Metallica.
 Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
 Really?
 These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
 Doesnt Charles know hes compromising my attack readiness? Its not a dress code. Its a death sentence.
 Kay, thank you. Its a straight jacket!  Okay.
 When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybodys worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
 Hey. Eds Tires is thinking of making a change.
 They have some great kitchen ideas.
 Its small, I know.
 Thanks, Michael.  Wait, what is this?
 Wh-  I dont need $6 to help a friend.
 Michael, you know I cant take this.
 But dont forget you owe me $10.
 Michael.
 You needed to speak to me?
 I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
 Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
 Your concern is noted.
 Like a wolf. Thank you.
 Really?
  Its firm.
 I dont know that I can do that now. You know, uh, somethings come up.
 No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. Its not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, theyre changing fast.
 Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then theres this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
 Good, do you see what Im saying?
 No.
 No.
 It is possible that I could be talking about us.
 It is the situation that we are in now.
 Im not a barbarian.
 I will.
 Yes?
 Ive said too much.
 Im sorry, Michael
 I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now Im okay with it.
  Dwight Schrute.
 I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
  Mr. Schofield, please?
 Dammit!
 I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. Im not worried.
 And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, were all making observations!
 And no, I cannot lower my current prices.  Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, youre considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
 Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So its not exactly like Highlander, but still...
 I would like to arrange a truce.
 Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
 Michael.
 In which direction?
 At what time?
 That-
  Michael.  Sorry.
 Michael.
 You were making me do things that were not all right.
 And not come through for you?
 I want a truce.
 Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredos.
 I had fish yesterday.
 Oh, hi, Michael. Im so sorry Im late. I got stuck in traffic.
 I hit a bear.
 Hes technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.  Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
 Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?
 Did you enjoy your lunch?
 No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
 Me.
 I broke it.
 Yes.
 You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy youve created. You have unleashed the wolf!
 And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
 Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is  Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you dont say.
  Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend."  "Tall" and "beets."
 And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife.  I see youre begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
 Sure. Thatd be fine.
 This is war and that is what happens.
 Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
 Michael! Michael!
 Dont let him in! Hes a traitor! Michael!
 Are you saying you invented paper?
 Its not the soil! Its the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
 Spin move.
 Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
 I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
 La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
 Come on.
 What hes not telling you is that he will abandon you.
 Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, hows your gay son?
 How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
  Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
 Its not your fault. Some people just dont want to be inspired.
 Been there, done that.
 David Wallace! Hello, weve been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
 Come along, afterthought.
 Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
  I say we fill Michaels office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
  No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.
 Five minutes exactly.
 Sure thing.
  Idiot, were starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
 Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
 There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
 Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  Thats how you really apply the pressure.
 You know what?  Why dont I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  Im the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
 Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why youre leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.    Charles.
  May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
  Theyve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  Theyre desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  Theyre total failures.
 Quiet you.
 You dont crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  Thats like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, Ive solved plenty.
 Im gonna answer Charles first.
 Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
 Done.
 Im not-- Im not following you.
 Wh--
   Wh--what are you doing?
 Wait, what?
 Yeah , arent we getting those clients back?
 You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
 Fresh hot ink.
 Trust me, Stanley,  youre going to want to read this memo very carefully.
 No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
 When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
 Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
 Did you even read the memo?
 No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
 Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
 Were in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, Im not convinced that Michael and Pam didnt have a thing going while they were gone.
 No, youre too close.
  Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
 He doesnt like it.
 Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
  Get out!  We need to do something.  Im thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
 No, Im not saying we do those things.  Im saying something like those things.
 Excellent question.
 Words will never be enough.
 No, pictures are too interpretive.
 Oh.  Well, that--thats a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, well talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  Ill see everyone upstairs.
 Cmon.   Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  Im talking action--
 Lunch.
 Its pony.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
 Thats my client.
 Give me the phone.
 Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
 Hi, Mr. Bart.
  Hey, its Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
 Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, dont hang up.
 I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness.  Ryan!
 Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
 Youre a secretary! What do you know?
  And youre a temp and Im taking your phone.   Im confiscating this.
 We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
 No, we gotta be deadly serious.  Well start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
 Right.
 Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
 I dont know that first things about secret meetings.
 Ill do--
  Ill do the best I can.
 Deceit does not come easy to me.
  Thats fair.
 Listen up, Flenderson.  Youre being weak and ineffectual.  Im cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
 No.
 Thats debatable.
 Shut up.
  I got her!
 I do.
 Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
  Now, how can I help you?
 Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
 It is a big deal. Cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learners permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
 No.
  All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
 Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Whos Phillip?
 Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
 Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
 What do you think history is?
 Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
 You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
  Im gonna need two able bodied men.
 You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
 Come on. Relax. The shirt wasnt doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
 No kidding! She sits three feet from me. Its the most annoying thing.  Its like children singing Christmas carols.
 Tell me where it hurts.
 Oh yeah. youve got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
 This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
 Im gonna with the python.
 No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
 Whats so funny?
 Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
 You cant steal what is legally your property.
  What do you need from me?
 Normally I dont condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I dont know.  No, Im kidding. Hes just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
  Like clockwork.
 Bye Michael!  Yeah!
 Im gonna say 30.
 Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
 Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
 Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
 Listen up everyone! Ive gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jims whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
 Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
 Why? I dont understand.
 Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
 Ill tell you what, Im gonna do you one better. Im gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
 Sly dog.
 Come on, folks!
 Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
 I couldve gotten that, idiot!
 Its not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Lets focus! Come on, youre better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
||
  Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hands on the net.
 Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if youre right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
 Yes! We advance to the next round!
  Hit it Andy!
 Dont set it to yourself!
 What happened?
 You werent even moving.  Okay, sub!
 Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-
 Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
 Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
 Because if we dont play, then the other team wins.
 Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
 Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
 Rolph, leave it alone!
 Pam!
  Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. Ill stall em.
 Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!!  Ill get it.
 Okay. Fine.
 Except, you know what? Its not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
 No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
 Seven? Can I finish please?
 Eight?
