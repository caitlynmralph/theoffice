 Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
 So, whats the joke? Youre not perfect either.
 So who are we laughing at?
 Who? Dave Barry?
 What is it? Who wrote it?
 That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, youll be punished less.
 No, no, no, no...
 ...no, no, no, no, its not what you think.
 No, why were you in there?!
 What were you doing in there?
 I am not.
 Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
 We are going to have two mens rooms.
 Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to...
 Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
 ...for peoples behavior.
 And its-
  Yes!
  Best Dundies ever.
 Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
 Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and Im not afraid to use it.  Devon!
 The waitress tripped on the cord.
 Really? We dont have any girls from HR.
 Yeah?
 Yeah!
 Like an AIDS test?
 Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! Its okay, Im a sheriffs deputy.
 Dont get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
 Its okay, Im going to use my shirt.
  Ahh! I cant-
 Watch your step.
 Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasnt a concussion.
 So the monkey does the sex thing right here!
 Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
 Consider it?
 Yes!
 Yeah, Meredith.
 Yes.
 Hey, Toby.
 You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
 Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
 Good. Good. And...
 Okay.
 Diversifying. Smart.
 And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. Peopled obey the law, thered be less troublemakers.
 You should go.
 Uh huh.
 You have your lawyer there?
 Can I be your representative?
 I think I should be there.
 Im good. I can make sure things are up to code.
 Please, Im always the guy you rely on at work.
 So youre taking a personal day?
 Please, Ill make you proud.
 Yes! As your representative?
 Same thing.
 I have been Michaels
 What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
  I want to put the top down.
 But then no one can see us.
 Check it out.  Terminator.
 Which ones yours?
 This is smaller than your old place.
 Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. Its a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
 Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
 Lets go check out the master bedroom.
 Oh. Terrible idea.
 No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
 Warrantees dont cover it, plus theyre a rip-off.
 Shh Shh.
 Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
 What kind of mortgage did you get?
 Ho, thirty years.
 Wow, youll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
 Forget about retiring when youre 65. Hey, Ive got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, thats where the nurse can live.
 Well, this is it.
 Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
 Well be here waiting for you.
 A thirty year mortgage at Michaels age essentially means that hes buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldnt hear the other dead people.
 Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
 You didnt have to...
 I dont even know what to say.
 Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
 Its a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
 Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
 Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
 Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
 Just for fun?
 Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
 Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. Its a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And its under the porch.
 You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
 People love beets.
 Everybody loves beets.
 Lets get this roof going.
 Ow.
 What is going on?
 Thats my stopwatch.
 Silver medal.
 Michaels in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasnt evaluated me in years.
 Michael and I have a very special connection. Hes like Batman, Im like Robin. Hes like the Lone Ranger, and Im like Tonto. And its not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
  People!
 This is not a test! Move to the exits!
 Head towards the exits.
 Get up off your desks!
 No, panic is warranted!
 This is not at drill!
 Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
 This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
 This is not a test! Can you leave?!
 DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
 Do you want to die? OUT!!
 STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
 Move to the exits!
 Weve got smoke! Weve got smoke! Smoke! Gah!  Oh, Kelly! Youre okay! Ive got you!
 Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
 Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? Theyll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Lets go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
 Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michaels number one. Where is he? Where is he?
 Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
 NO!
 Okay, he can have 14. Marjorys not here today.
 Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
 Thats funny, too. But if were the Three Musketeers...
  Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, theres a...
 Okay. Great, thats going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question is there fire wood on the island?
 Then I would bring an axe, no books.
 Fine. Physicians Desk Reference.
 ...hollowed out, inside waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerers Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
 Is this your car, Ryan?
 Good shocks.
 Do it.
 Keep an existing...
 Yeah, but look, I mean, he didnt need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
 Self taught. You didnt even go to college.
  Come on. Im studying with the master, huh?
  You should learn from him, right?
 Right?
 Stupid!
 The Crow.
 Why didnt I go to business school?
 The temp.
 Yeah, its all him and Michael talk about anymore.
 He doesnt even know that I do that.
 Oh yeah, Pam. Right. Thats going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
 Im sorry I said that, I didnt... just part of me meant it. Besides, hed end up being a hero anyway.
 Oh Jim, Im not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
 Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
 Would that make you happy?
 If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
 Im on it.
||
  Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they dont teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
 Thats exactly what I said.
 Were you absent?
 You failed?
 I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready?  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the worlds been turning!
 Everybody!
    ... Marilyn Monroe!
 Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
 Answer me this, though.
 Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
 Really?
 The fire guy! The fire guy!
  Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
  What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
 Yeah, well look...  What about me?
 I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
 Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH!
 Jim. Definitely.
 Phyllis.
 Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
 One of the warehouse guys.
 Who is he saying?
 No, Michael.
  No, not me.
  Not Dwight.
 I know thats what he said.
 Tell him, not Dwight.
 Tell him to stop.
 Quiet, you.
 Make him be quiet.
 Stanley, could you come with me, please.
 As Assistant Regional Manager...
 Look! Ive got some bad news. Youre fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  Im serious, Stanley. Its over.  Im sorry.
 He wouldnt listen to me
 If you want to fire him, youre going to have to tell him yourself.
  Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. Im very flattered. Dont get me wrong. Im just not sure that its my official resume or if its something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, Im gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
 Would I ever leave this company? Look, Im all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what Im getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, Im going wherever they value loyalty the most.
  So you got the fax? So why didnt you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when Im dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So youll let me know when youve made a decis...
 This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
 I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
 And I turned it down.
 Out of loyalty to this company...
 ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
 But then you wouldnt have me here.
 Its in Maryland.
 I cant. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
 Where is my desk?
 This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
 I didnt lose my desk.
 Okay, who moved my desk?
 Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
  Dwight Schrute.
 Jim, Ive given you this information, like, twenty times.
 Its by the ream?
 ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
 Wash your hands, Kevin.
  Sensei, hello its Sempai...
 Dwight...
 Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
 No, that was my Sensei.
 I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
 Assistant Sensei.
 I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
 Impossible. The way theyre programmed... Youre mocking me.
 Look, Im going to offer you a little piece of advice. Im not afraid to make an example out of you.
 Ok, give that back to me.
 No. That is not a toy.
 Please?
 Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
 No women or children, unless provoked.
 Warehouse guy. Doesnt count.
 Because were friends.
 Argggg!
 What belt are they?
 No!
 Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Years Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
 Ok, Ill punch you.
 Kiyah!
 Did I want to harm Michael? The one man Ive been hired to protect? No, I did not.
 I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
  Take this pen and stab me with it.
 Good.
 Now watch, let me take you from behind.
 I didnt sucker punch you, Michael.
 In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
 Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
 No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
 Yeah.
 No, its free during the day. Its fine.
 Ive got the key.
 Yes, Sensei!
 Hiii!
 Yes!
 Eat it!
 Two more.
 No.
 It was my pants.
 No holding.
 No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
 No, Michael!
 I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
 Just put "The Hospital." Contact number just put 9-1-1.
 Im busy.
 Of course.
 Michael, I dont know...
 I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
 Ill have Pam send out a memo.
 Just a formality.
 Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
 Thank you, Sensei.
 Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
 Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
 You took something that doesnt belong to you.
 Brought it in here-
 Made copies of it-
 Not now!
 Ok, what are they?
 Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
 Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
 If it isnt my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
 Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission.
 Pow! Pow! Pow!
 Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
 Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And youre disgusting, Dwigt.  Wait, whos Dwigt?
 D-W-I-G-H-T.
 Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  Thats it, the end.
 Uh, you dont speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
  Michael?  Michael?   Michael?   His cars not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports.  Whos this?  Jan?
 Did you do her?
 Jan Levinson-Gould.
 Did you do her?
 And she is your boss.
  You should get one of these.
 Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
 This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry.
 Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
 Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that.
 Its only twenty-five bucks.
 Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Heres a little tip for your performance review.
 Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
 Oh, yes, we do.
 Yeah, its a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and hell be sure to give you a raise.
 Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
 Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I dont have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please dont call me, and well see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
 Uh, duh.
 Saturday.
 Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
 No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
 What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
 It happens occasionally.
 Tom?
 Next suggestion.
 You need to do something about your B.O.
 You need-
 To do something about-
 Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
 Next suggestion.
 "Dont sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
  You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise!  Yes!  Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... Im awesome! I am awesome!
 Michael?
 Im sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
 Great.
 I am ready for my performance review.
 Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
 That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word dedication.  I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
 I have a copy of your key.
 Id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
 For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
 You liked it!
 Jan, have you ever had deer?
 Its a delicacy.  And you know what?  Its an aphrodisiac.  So when were done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
 And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what Im capable of".
 Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
  Im here! Im here! Im here! Its ok!
 Mi-
 Sorry.
 Ok, Im sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
 You have to tell me.
 Look, Michael, I know you dont want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
 Yeah, but that doesnt matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
 Or get hit by a car-
 Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
 So its true?  You have access to our e-mails?
 Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
 Good.
 Nice.
 Does he have access to their medical records?
 I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyones psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
 Question on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
 I was wondering-
 Why?
 Like who?  Who doesnt know?
 Why just Michael?
 Is it?
 Oh, thats perfect!
 I wont.
 Battlestar Galatica.
 I cant-
 Tonight.
 Unfortunately, Ive got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
 Clarinet.
 Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that youre doing, and Ill see you Monday.   He has no idea!
 Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
 You dont work with us.
 Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
 When is the guest of honor coming?
 Hes gonna love it!
 Surprise!   Everybody!
 Go. Get the door.
 Go. Push!
 Push!
 Really shove it.
 Shove it through! Break it!
 I got a splinter.
 Ive got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
 One, two, three.
 You guys should use a hand truck.
 No.
 Michael, I would like to be the elf.
  Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
 Gather round. Secret Santa, lets go. Lets go. Come on. Stanley, no, Im going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
 I want to do it.
 Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
 First present, Oscar.
 Okay. Okay. Thats enough. Lets keep it moving on. Jim.
 Pam.
 All right, next. Ryan.
 Michael.
 We dont do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
 Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
 Angela, youre up.
 Okay, moving along. Meredith, lets go.
 Its already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
 You and me, Michael. Yes!
 I never said it was better than an iPod.
 Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
  Take that, Saddam!
 Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
 Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
 Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
 No trades.
 "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane.
 This is so awesome.
 Thank you.
 Oh, hello there.  But what are you doing?
 You shouldnt do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
 Yes.
 Hello. Jim?
 This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
 Yeah, well, Im not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because youre friends with the vending machine guy.
 Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
 No, no, no, no, no. Thats my pencil cup.
 Uh, I think so, and youre going to hand it over to me.
 Okay, fine. Wheres my wallet?
 But I dont have any...
  Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
 Good morning, Michael.
 Aye aye, Captain.
 Cool.
 Limbo, whoo!
 Me! Me, me, me.
 Im stronger.
 I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
  What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
 I cant. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
 Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
 Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. Hes let me steer the ship for the last hour.
 Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
 Dont worry, Michael. Im taking us to shore.
  What is going on? What is going on?
 Im coming Michael!
 Im gonna save you!
 Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
 Your foot?
   It slipped.
 Sorry.
 Hey, Pam, Im assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
 What?
 No, I didnt.
 What is wrong with
 Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
 Yeah, theyre like an i-Pod only theyre better cause theyre chunkier and more solid.
 Oh, no no no.  Dont go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
 Yeah, Ill write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
 Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
 These covers are totally indestructible.
 Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it wont break.  Chuck it.
 Oh no, its broken.
 No, its fine.  I told you it wouldnt break.  You could throw it all day long.
 Yep.
 Huh. Do you like candy?
 Cause youre sweeter than candy.
  Dad?
   Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
 I want Michael to take me...
 Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
 Vietnam sounds.
 Tired...
 Want to take a rake... .
 Ahh!
 Ok, Pam, thanks.
 Youre the best.
 It smells like chicken soup.
 I have to go to the hospital.
 Where we going?
 Ill be back, I mean...
 Why?
 Aw, Pam, youre adorable
||
 Oh, huggy hugs.
 Where are we going?
 Where are we going?
 I found it under the seat.
 Im thirsty.
 No!
 Im thirsty!
 No.
 You cant fire me, I dont work in this van!
 No.
  Mmmmm...
 My eyes!
 My eyes!
 Danger.
 Hi Michael!
 Ahhh.  Mweehaa
 What is that?
 Thats what she said.
 I dont want to do this.
 Oh.
 Whats up-dog?
 Good. How are you doing?
 Empty mind.
 Meredith, mens room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  Theyre worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
 Thats unacceptable.
 Michael.
 Oscar is out sick.
 Can I do some of the talking?
 Ok, let him know that Im here.
 And Dwight.
 Ask him his symptoms. Im on Web M.D.
 Checks out.
 Ok. First impressions?
 Which is exactly how youd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
 Question? May I investigate?
 Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so Im no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
 Do you
  Oh God, here.
 Hey Oscar how ya doin? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like youre too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
 There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
 Ok, what is going on here?
 Oh, really nothing? Fact You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
 Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
 Is that true?
 Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
 I can tell. I wont let you down.
 Who took all the black ones?
 So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
 Sniffling how?
 Three.
 Ok, good, thank you.  That wasnt so hard now was it?
 Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
 Including prep time?
 As a volunteer Sheriffs Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
 Stay low... This is it... There he is. Hes been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Lets roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know whats going on here. You werent sick at all.
 This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
 How bout this. I dont tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
 Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscars malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesnt want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, its just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
  Its still stinky.
 She probably scrubbed it
  Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
 Okay.
 Yeah!
  Mm.
 No way!
 And who had your office?
 That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
 No!
 I thought he was out on the road.
 Ah.
  Michael.
 What?
 Yeah!
 Should we help em pick up their stuff?
 Okay.
  Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  Im totally gonna win us that box set.
 Jethro Tull...
  I need to make a sales call.  Please?
  Am I the 107th caller?
 Yeah!
 It is so on!
 Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
 But youre the one who picked today.
 Its a terrible idea.
 Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long theyre going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
 Yeah!
 We could do it in the warehouse.
 Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
 Okay. Lets go. Step up.
 Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
 No.
 No.
 Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas aint free!"
 Not literally.
 Word.
 And you want me to come with you.
 I will stay here and run things on this end.
 Question. Will you be seeing Jan when youre in New York?
 Well... Its Valentines Day, and you guys, you know...
 Screwed.
 Whats this? What is this?
 Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
  Happy Valentines Day.  Its me. Im the bobble head. Yes!  Ahh!
 Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present Ive ever gotten.
 Oh I did. I did.
 Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
 Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
 No, Pam, Just. Just,
  Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didnt get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that shes not really the kind of person youd think would be into Valentines Day. Shes kind of...
 (smirking) Exactly.
 You mean, like a ham?
 Ok, I get it.
 Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.
 Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
 They are either going to say yes... or no.
 Think it through.
 Fumble! Yaaah!
 Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
 Ryan.
 Ooh. Theyre having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you dont have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
 Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question Do their pizzas play DVDs?
 Ha! I dont get it.
 Well, its not really a big speech. You still coming right?
 What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."
 When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word failure.
 I cant do this.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay, deal! Ill do whatever you say. No questions asked.
 Ill try and think of one. When...
 Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
 Saleswoman has a vagina.
 But Im right?
 Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
 Could I have a copy of one of them?
 Yeah!
 That is so great about the bonus!
 Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
 Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
 They are unrelated.
 He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
 Yes.
 Good morning, Vietnam!  Okay. You know what? This isnt working. Because um Im not nervous in front of them. Theyre my subordinates.
 Uh, yes you are. Im Assistant Regional Manager.
 Michael, can you explain?
 I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
 Oh please! Youre not taking any trip.
 You did?
 Yes. I am.
 Which is?
 Ill glance at it.
 Thank you, Angela.
 No, I cant... I ca...
  Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years weve been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetimes struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you  and youll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
 WE ARE WARRIORS!
 Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
  Yeah. Yes!
 No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
 Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. Theyll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
 Ok, thanks.  There you are. What happened?
 It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
 What? Something happened?
 Weird.
 Con artist.
  Mmm... hello tiny one.
 You are the future!
 There is no way that hurt.
 Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I dont have all day.  I dont feel anything. Nothing.  Youre so weak.  Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collectors items, okay?
 No, I dont have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
 You call your mom Meredith? Thats very disrespectful.
 You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
 Schrute. Mister Schrute.
  ... Schrute.
  That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, its called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864.  The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And ere they dream when hes about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
 Theres a photo...
 These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
  Nazi was a fascist movement...
 ...from the 1930s...
 I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
 ...Okay.
 We have better service than they do!
 Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
  And he
 Uh, okay. But first, thats not my name.
 Well at least Im not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
 And they do, your parents, love you very much.
 The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there werent enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood.  They didnt eat the children.
 Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
 Birthday hug!
 That suit is amazing.
 Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
 Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
 Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
 Lets get the party started.
 Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
 Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.
 Yes, but he doesnt want to know when, or whom.
 Its For the Longest Time, by William Joel. Its you favorite song.
 I probably care more than she does.
 Uh, thats a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
 Listen up everyone! It is 1123 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mothers vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
 There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
 So come help me celebrate Michaels birth moment. Kevin!
 Creed! Come on. Stanley!
 On three, were going to hoist away! Ready?
 Happy birth moment, Michael.
 One. Two. Three!
 Oscar...
 Okay, that is
 F. Alright, whats the damage?
  Thirty nine... sixty.
 Why tip someone for a job Im capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
 Here they come.
 Come and get it!
 Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
 Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left .
 Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
 Oh. I got it.
  This is the most important day of the year. I cant risk anything.
 What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
  But what if im hungry?
 Here we go. Make a wish.
 Yaoo yay!
 Pam was supposed to get em.
 Where have you been? And dont say the bathroom, cause I kicked in all the stalls.
 Please, dont.
 Ill get someone to take it down.
 YEAH!
 Turn it around. Turn it around.
 Number one!!
 Kevin Malone, youre next. Spit that out.  Spit... Okay, come on, lets go.
 Thanks, girl.
 Lets go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
 I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriffs deputy to make friends. And by the way, I havent.
 Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now Im going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
 I didnt know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
 Okay, Im gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
 Dont make me do this the hard way.
 I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
 I cant stop this investigation. It is my job.
 I volunteered for this job.
 It is my duty...
 ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
 If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
 Well, you have...
 ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
 ...and I am very proud of being a narc.
 Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmothers funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? Hes a potential drug mule.
 Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
 Do you think its possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
 Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
 He sure left in a hurry.
 I dont want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
 Do you know what this is?
 How do you know that?
  Dammit.
 No, its marijuana.
 Thats ridiculous, of course it wasnt me.
 I would remember.
 Thats not how it works.
 Knock it off, okay, Im interviewing you.
||
 I know youre innocent, but I cant look like Im treating you any differently.
 Where were you yesterday after work?
 Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyones urine.
 Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
 No you cant do that.
 No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
 Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
 Angela, what about you?
 Youre not on
 Thank you, Michael.
 No, you will be tested.
 You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
 Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriffs deputy.
 Mine was green.
 Im all better.
 What kind of filing?
 That goes directly to the tester.
 Like in a cup?
 For what purpose?
 Then I refuse.
 Are you serious?
 But thats illegal.
 Not my urine.
 Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
 I want him to have all the urine he needs.
 I know that. Dont you think I know that?
 My fathers name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfathers name was Dwight Schrute. His fathers name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning hed wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didnt know about it. He didnt tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
 Thats great.
 Its a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
 I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
 Really?
 Thats fantastic because Ive always felt that the security here sucked .
 Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great.   Can I have a gun?
 Okay, Ill have to bring in my bow staff.
  Thank you, Michael.
 I need to go over some details with you.
 First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
 Oh, God.
 Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
 Clown paint.
 I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
 Oh, hes sure. Just shoot.
 Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
 That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
  Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
 That doesnt make any sense.
 No.
 I never smile if I can help it. Showing ones teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
 This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
 And my middle name is Kurt, not Fart.
 I have another complaint for Jims permanent file.
 What box?!
 Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
 No! You calm down! Whos side is Toby on? Whos side are you on?
 Him or me?
 Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
 Either he goes, or I go.
 You choose!
 One of us is out of here by the end of today!
 I am not bluffing!
 Okay?
 Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
 I deserve this. You know I do!
 You have till five.
 Oh, look, Jim. Theres a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her youre interested? I could put in a good word for you, cause Ill still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
 Its a good market. Higher volume.
 I have a girlfriend...
 So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
 I want an answer by tomorrow.
 Fine.
 Come on, lets go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Lets go.
 I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
 I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
 Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
 Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
 How would you do that?
  You cant be serious. Are you serious?
 I dont believe you. Continue.
  Thats ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why dont you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
 Oh, my God.
 Yes!
 Wait, canine AIDS?
 Actually, its owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
 When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
 Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
 Im Michaels wingman. Ive got his back. Two dates. Hes got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."
 I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
 Hey, hey.
 Jans here.
 Give me the dice.
 Lets go.
 Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
 Thank you, Angela.
 Yeah! Yeah!
 Give me the dice!
 Come on, shooter!
 Come on.  So where you staying? Radisson?
 Super 8?
 Motel 6? Best Western?
 Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
 Nice, very nice.
 Oh, man!
