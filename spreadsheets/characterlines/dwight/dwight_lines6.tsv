  Extreme! Parkour!
 Andy! Leapfrog!
 Yeah!  Parkour! Parkour!
 Okay.
  Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!
 Lets do it!
  Good. Excellent. Thank you.
  Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevins desk?
 Go put them all in random order.
 Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
  Okay, let me finish this thought.
  He most definitely does. Hes been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
  People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think its because of my low cheekbones. And... boom.  Okay, what is it, what cant I guess?
 Stanleys way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
  Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, Ive attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
  Well now you cant call me at all. Problem solved.
 Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you  will make a great mother. Its up to you to choose which you want to be.
 Michael...  You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?
 Whos the father?
   Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
   Oh really, Im sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didnt know we were in communist Sweden.
   Nnnnn, thats not... okay.
   Im talking about... hmmm.
   So long Darryl, feel better...  Hes lying.
   Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People dont just fall off of ladders.
   Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?    Yall having birthday cake?
   Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
   It just doesnt add up.
   Nah, thats a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
   I have been my whole life.
   Im rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
   Yeah.
   Yeah, its just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
   Wa... wa... wait , someones coming.
   Here, get down! Hes not using crutches!  Get the camera!
   Oh, workers comp, my ass!
   Toby...
   Ooohhh...   Oh man!  You okay?
   I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if theyre dilated.
   We thought that she was you.
   Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
   Aww, Darryl.
   Wait!  Theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator.
   He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
   Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
   Yes!
   Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
   Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
   Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
   Im... I was making it.
  AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
  Could you please sign my expense report?
   Sign this.
 Sign it.
 Idiot.
  I have a complaint about Jim.
 I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
 Jim wont sign my expense report.
 No, that is huge.
 This has to do--
  Id like to lodge a complaint.
 You!
 One minute ago.
 Angry.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
 Im not cr-- uhh!
 I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And hes gasping, hes panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious!  Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
 This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
 What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
 Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
  And Jim!
 I think it was Creed.
 People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. Its great. Eventually, theyll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
 Come on in.    Thats right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
 Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
 Are we idiots?  What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- lets get him. Tock-- lets get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- thats a clock! The time is getting very close! Its now or never! What say you?!
 No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?  Okay.
 Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed. Its amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. Its so bad ass.
 Oh, gee, Im sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
 Come on. Youve got to be kidding me.
 Well see.
 But you can say that about anything.
 What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
 Its easy. Thats what Im saying.
 I stole the guest list from Jims desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
 Yes.
 For instance, Pams cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
 Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
 Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
 She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
 Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
 What? No way!
 Oh. God.
 You know what? I made you a cd...
 Mmm-hmm.
 This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
 Youre gonna like this.  "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. Whats next?, youre probably wondering. Dont be scared of youre night in heaven--"
 Yeah. Its practical.
 The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
 Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number Romeo. Tango. G7745.
 And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
 Ok.
 No way. What if I meet someone?
 No. No.
 You would?
 Really?
 Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
 Oh no. Now that I dont have a room, can I stay with you?
 Please?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
 No you do not.
 It worked.
 From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. Its all in the report.
 Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss mans butt.
 Thats right. It is ew. It is very ew.
 Its just for family.
 Isabel Poreba. Oh, Ive got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
 Thats a very good record.
 Knight Rider.
 No.
 Very smart.
 What? Its a casual, social outfit.
 No. Theyre howling at the moon. Its suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
 Im just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
 Nine and three-quarters.
 I invented a device called Burger on the Go. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Malls considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, No.
 Michael.
 Drop this one. Abort.
 I found twins.
 Arent they magnificent?
 I love finding a good set of twins.
  Hey-O!
 Congratulations.
 Oh my goodness.
  Youll have Pam to answer to.
 "Jim... hey why dont you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV."
   You have everything?
 Cell phone?  Charger?
  It really is.  Im not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldnt want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
 You know it.
  Okay, get out of here.
 Okay.
  Really?  I hadnt noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
  Im ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
  Hey, what was she like?
  Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
  No kidding.
  I bet she had hairy armpits.
 Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesnt think this is going anywhere.
 No.
 Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
  Look.  Shes a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  Shes a bumpkin.  Pass.
  You should ask her out.
  I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
   That was an intelligent comment.
 Oh.  Fine.  Isabel,  nice to see you.  What do you want?
  So, uh tell me again the difference between Filenes and Filenes basement.
  Toby.
  Id like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
   Crap.    Come here you.
 I think youre right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
 Did he threaten you?
 I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
 No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
 Exactly.
 No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. Thats why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."
 Lock your door!
 Thats bad.
 Thats bad.
 Hes right. Cops cant do anything until a crime has been reported.
 You know what?
 Thats an exaggeration.
 No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give em a taste of cat food pretty soon theyll be back for the whole cat.
 The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
 Heres what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he cant be openly violent.
 Let him know youre not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That youre stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
 Do you know how to use it?
 Youre wearing loafers!
 Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
 Youll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
 Hello.
 Oh hes not that nice.
 What hes trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
 Bring him the gabba-gool!
 He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
 So were choosing...
 Check out Dental?
 Dont do it!
 Dont.
 Yes.
 I dont understand, why would you buy a policy?
 It wasnt a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
 Do you know what "snap decision" means?
 It means like this.
 We have let Michael down, and its 85 percent your fault.
 Not on the inside hes not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
 Not the living in fear, thats new.
 Yes. Hes got to stand up to this mafia guy.
 Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
 Yeah...
 What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guys not mafia!
  Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
 Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
 Its true, hes clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasnt on the take. Turns out hes a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
 And he made us all look like chumps!
 Okay thats-
 Thats good, lets wrap it up.
 We just told you he wasnt mafia, so you wouldnt be scared.
 You successfully backed down the mob!
 Very close.
 Yeah!
 Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
 Yeah...
 This conversation has two items on the agenda.
 Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. Its not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I dont care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so Id just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!
  Youre welcome!
 I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
 Im sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
 Mallard. Okay, Ill get out of your hair.
  You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
 Theres an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
 Theres a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
 ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
  The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
  What were you talking about in there?
  Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
  I dont think theres a whole lot of sleeping going on.
   Shh!
  Where did you get that mallard?
  That!
  Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, Im taking that back.
   Ill give you five bucks for it.
  Ten.
  Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
   Im sorry.
  Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
  Oh, Im equipped... I can...
  Dont tell Michael...
  Punishment fits the crime, I accept.
   "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..."  Ive got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  Im not insane.  "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."
 Im Jigsaw, idiot.
 Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
 Michael?
 A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. Theyre mocking you with wordplay.
 Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
 I dont want people making fun of my nose.
 Its too small.
 Just, write it down, please.
 Hey! Its on the list, everybody.
 Thank you.
 Michael, please. Stop it now. Youre embarrassing yourself.
 Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
 Judas.
 Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
 Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
 No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
 Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
 Oh, dont mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
  Good morning Michael.
 Hungry?
  Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
  Youre thinking of deer penis.
  Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.   Bagel?
  K. I brought cheese too.
 Excellent.
 Okay.  You owe me.
 Cant a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so theyll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
 Pam, would you care for a bagel?
 Thats right.  Youre a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  Ill try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
  Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
 Wow--
  I will.
  Let me get that door for you--
 There you go!
  Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, heres a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
 Observe.
 Right?
 Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
   And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
 Thank you very much for that.
  Have a seat.  Allow me.
  You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
  No, no, no!
  Andy is complicating things.  But Im not worried.  This will only up my game.
 Whats going on in here?
 Oh... no... really?
  There is no book.  Theres only a survival guide.
 Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyones tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
  Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.
  Dont worry about it.  You can just owe me.
 Whats going on?
 Alright, move it.
 Oh yeah, youre going to owe me big time.
 Got it.  To Dwight. Wha--   Starbucks gift card.
  Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.   Theyre mushrooms.  They dont get that high.
  Wait, why are you limping?
  Lets get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
  Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
  Fire Jim.
 Im cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
 Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.
  Can I have an office?
  You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  Its worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  Im keeping it.
    Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
  How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch
  No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
  False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
  That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
  Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes.   Block.  Grasp wrist as such.
  Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.   Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, youre not.  Ow!  Oh!
 He really is, but not for long.    Ow! Instep, oh, not again.   You let go, you let go.  Oh, youre right, I cant hold on.
  The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
  Michael?
  What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
 This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
  Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that its all conjecture.  If theres any concrete news you will know ASAP.
  You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesnt pay much and you cant unionize.
   He needs me.  Seat saved infinity.
  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Im the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
  I will poison your food.
  Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
  I know you did it!
  I know she didnt do it.  Its never the person you most suspect. Its also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
  Frankly, Im not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
  Youre sure it was water, it couldnt have been acid?
  Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
  Answer me.
  You are out of order.
  Hey shut up.  Youre dead.
  Oh, this could be a juicy one.
  OK, everybody just calm down.
  I have crossbows.
  OK, Im ready.
 Bow down before Recyclops.
 Happy Earth Day, everyone. Im Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
 Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
 Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
 Recyclops will have his revenge.
 Recyclops destroys!
 Yes.
 Polluticorn wishes.
 Humans are terrible for the environment.
 The twirl sucks.
 What kind of mileage does this baby get?
 Calves. Calves all the way.
 Smells like it.
 Word.
 Ill ask you a question.
 Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
 Good luck, Michael.
 Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.  Ah. Damn it.  Wha- okay
 I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
 How is he gonna have grandkids?
 No. You will not.
 Oh, Im sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
 Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
  Yes.
 Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
 Yeah.
 Yeah!  Your idea.
 My idea.  I just need Andy to think its his idea.  So it wont get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
 Hey Jimmy, whats up?
 Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
 That laugh is so infectious.
 I didnt mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you dont nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
 This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
 In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
 Im going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
 Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
 So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
 He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
 You seem suprised.
 Hey buddy, so every-
 Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
 Oh, no!
 Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize."  Isnt that what you said?
 My idea!
 Excellent idea, Pam.
 There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
 He knew all along!
  This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
 Tell him Im mad at Jim, because hes asking us to give money to Pam.
  This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
  Its Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
 I know how it happened.
 No!
 What?
 No.
 What?
 Oh, youre kidding me!
 Damn it!
 Apparently.
  Not now, Temp.
 What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldnt even know how to begin a diabol...
 So what do you want?
  Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
 --the party planning committee...
 But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas. Good.
 My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph!  Not really! Im just tired. The days are short. I dont know. Maybe Im depressed.
 It is time to unveil the tree.
 It is warm feelings.
 Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!
 Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
 Exactly.
 Everyone.
 Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
 Like the spirit of Christmas!
 This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
 Hey Santa!
 For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that Ive been attempting to assemble. Im suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
 Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
 What else does it look like?
 Well I dont have all the pieces yet.
 Not a gun.
 We dont have a North Pole branch. Idiot.
 Yes!
 Whats your pin number?
 Where? Holiday Inn? I dont ...
 You are kidding me!
 When? When did he tell you? Today?
 Awww!
 Aaaarrhh!
 Hey David.
 Yeah!
  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Dont know where it goes, but its home to me and I walk alone.
 Its true. We all walk alone.
  My shadows the only one that walks beside me. My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating...
 I have no idea.
 Michael? Please! Come on!
 Oh man!  I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
 Its real slippery out here.
 Oh, we will. Have a seat.
 He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
 Ignore him. Hes the local lunatic.
 Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the companys top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one Im currently wearing is that of gracious host.  Welcome.
  Thank you, so much.
 Hope to see you soon.
 Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
 What?
 What?
 But check that its covered by your
 But the little cars go in the compact spot!
 Dont lose your head.
 What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
  What?
 Here we go.  Oh! Wow.
 Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
 Terrible mistake.
 Undistributable.
 Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
 Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
 So excited.
 Oh. Of course.
  Theyre 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
  Im not seeing anything under "confirmation."
 Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those.
 You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
 Michael...
 Wait, I got it! Confirmation code XV2RDM!
 Thank you.
 Hello.
 I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
  I, uh...
  Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. Hes been promoted to sole manager. Weve got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds.  89... 88...
 Youre twenty minutes late!
 Just admit you lost track of time.
 Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
 Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
 Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
 I like where youre going with this. Continue.
 I have an old barn!
 Its kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
 Okay, thats your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
 Hes supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
 Think!
 The new IT guy. Nick.
 I think he is the key. Hes very trusting, hes looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
 Why dont you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
 Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
 I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
 You know, we really dont announce out loud our sales that much.
 Its not really 1992 anymore.
 Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
 I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyones computer passwords.
 Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
 No, the cops called us. So Im gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halperts computer.
 Michael, its Phyllis.
 She sent an email, so.
 Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what? Michael!
  I cant help but think that something we did made this possible.
 Oh temp, I like that. Im going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
 Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
 It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
  Wait a minute!  You cant do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
  No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
    Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, its just horrific.  The  doctor says hed never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
  I need a baby.  Ill never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, Ive been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
  Ha, nerd.
    Bare my child.
  I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Lets meet at 400 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
  Have a seat.
  Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
  Its been a long time since weve come down here separately.
  Now, then.  Lets get to it, shall we?  Item one   Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
  Acceptable names include and are limited to  Ebenezer.
  Jonas.
  Warf.
  Okay.  Fine.
  Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
  Yes you can.
  Its as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
  No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
  Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
   "We" dont.
  Doesnt matter.  Ill escort you!
  Lets go!
   Michael!
  This is where I saw that deer last week.
  Right over by that fence.
  Lets go!
  I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
  Ugh, alright.    Lets move!  ...  What?
  Are you kidding me?
  Dwight Schrute.
  Why didnt you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IMing you how bored I was.
  I dont need a key.
  No, no, dont, dont tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
  Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pams house to find Pams iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didnt find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good nights sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work .
    Hey, whats up, kid?
  Nothing left to do except dot the Is, the Js, and the umlauts.  Why dont you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
  Very well.
  Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
  Yup.
  Oh, its...  In the backyard.  Ill take this.
  Hey, listen.  I know that Im an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
  Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
  Alright.  Ill call you, kid.
  Two forms of ID, please.
  Nothing.
  Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...    I couldnt find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  Ill be out of your hair.
 Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
 Mega-Desk.
 Command central.
 Surveillance, gaming- and business.
 Okay. Come on! Jim!
 Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I dont care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
 Great.
 Thank you.
 Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
 They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
 Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
 Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
 What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
 I mean, youre here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
 Ill tell you what happened to me. I didnt see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
 Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
  Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
  My headphones are broken.
 Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
 Okay?  "The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"
 "-But well be together then-"
 "-Dad, you know well have a good time then."
 Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny OGannigans tonight. It shouldnt go all night long, so if youd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.  No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.
 Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening  I have...
 Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. Im just gonna reschedule for next week.
 What the hell is this?
 This is not Mega-Desk.
 Thats ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
 Hello, Dwight Schrute?
 Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
 Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
  You couldnt handle my undivided attention.
 Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
 When I was asking about the leads.
 ... is there any news on the leads?
 Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, Ill tell you what. Im going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out!
 Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
 What are you doing, idiot?
 Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it.  The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.
 The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
 The leads are in?
 Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
 Kevin! Damnit  Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? Cmon -
 Really.
  Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
 Where are they?
 Turn the trash  Its code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
  Clean sack.
  Its empty!
 Ill go, Michael. Youll just screw it up.
  This place has gone to hell.
  Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
 Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
 Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
 When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if Id assistant managed him -
 Oh, thats low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
 Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
 I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
 Kung-fu movies!
 Nice babies youre making with the floozies at the bars.
 Your made-up wife? Who doesnt exist?  You watch it!
 Dont do it
 No!
  Stop it, get out! Thats my spool.
 Oh
  Wow. Amazing, isnt it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
 Hey  You know whod like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
 Yeah
 Hope - grows.
  Woo hoo!
 We have an awesome bean bag chair thats perfect for the break room.
 Yeah, damn right youre not. Cause its for me and Michael only
 Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Not counting the last one, 25.
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
Okay.
And one girl push-up.
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isnt Isabel.
Whats a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Ooh, I love repartee.
Usually means theres a battle scene coming.
Any brothers or sisters?
Really?
Vegetarian?
Whats your blood type?
Universal donor.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Whacking moles. Hit em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Extend the fingers more.
Good.
Hey, monkey, how you doing?
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, Ive been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you dont need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
Its just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. Youre off the hook.
Dissolved. Dont worry, youre free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
With this move, he cant get you.
Oh, please. I wish hed come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Sh-what?
No, no, no.  Blah blah blah blah!
What are you-
Angela...
Youre really putting me in an awkward position here.
Angela, not here!
You are an impressive specimen.
||
 Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
 Her milk is coming in. Shes getting uncomfortable.
 Same thing happens with my cows if I dont tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else theyll moo like crazy.
  All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
 Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
 Yeah pretty much.
 Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
  Prideful idiots. Watch how its done.  Gabriel, I apologize.
  I kneel before you.
 Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
 What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
 "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."
 Guten tag, Herr Michael.
 I dont understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
 You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
 If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
 What is this?
 It doesnt just sound aight, it sounds amazing.
 How do I apply?
 Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
 Come here. Come here.
 Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden hes Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
 One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
 Oh, man. White people, right?
 Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
 I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
 I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
 I know, cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEOs can you think of?
 You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
 Thats not... shes... okay. Yes.
 How as being a minority affected you?
 Oh, good, and you resent this because...
 Oh, no, no. Thats not dorky.  Look, its easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Stranglers in the house. Inside the house.
 Hey... what are you guys doing?
 You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
 Ryan? What does he know?
 "We?"
 Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If youd have told me this morning that today Id be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
 Kelly is disqualified!
 You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. Youre welcome, America.
 Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
 Kelly is the only applicant.
 Oh, dear God. Okay. Dont make any decisions just yet. Okay? Ill be right back.
 How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
 I wasnt talking to you, pale-face.
 What Im offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
 Yes.
 Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
 I can protect you from Kelly.  Will you get out of here? Seriously.
 Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative.
 Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
 Caucasians, am I right?  Have a seat. Ill translate.
 You dont know what you need. Just...
 Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.
 Oh.
 Gosh. He he.
 Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
 Stop it!
 Youre talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Jokes on you cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
 Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize.  Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
 Michael, come on.
 Fine.  Hey. Tap away.
 Eel fishing.
 Are you nuts?
 Oh, no.
 Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
 I think Ive got one for you.
 $100 a day, plus expenses.
 Im just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
 And you might not like how I find it.
  Hi stranger.
 I work with Michael.
 Dwight Schrute.
 All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
  Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
 Its all yours.  Ah!
 Yeah, Im good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
 Tractor pulling. Too bad theres not a tractor here.
  Oh. Oh. Oh.  One thing you need to know about me. I dont quit until something tears or pops.  You look like youre getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
 Really? Hey, um...
 Get out of my way. Huh!
 Tomorrows fertilizer, am I right?
 Donna. Donna, wait, please. Im sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why Im here to see... you... naked... while... Im... naked.
 Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!
 Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
 Yeah, no. Shes not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.
 Put your fingers here.
 Im positive. Yeah, oh, and heres your expense receipts right there.
 People who dont trust egg whites.
 Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but shes coming over here and shes furious.
 Youre right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  "What is with him? He is crazy. Im coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. Youll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michaels office.
  Okay, everybody, lets take this next hill.
 You know what? You had your chance. Youre no leader. Out of your seat, lets blast!
 No! The hills a trap. Lets take the dirt road off to the side.
 If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No!  Youre dead, youre dead, youre dead. Good jump. Youre barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
  You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
  No, hmmm... thats still...
  Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Heres how you do it  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.  Phyllis, youre Hitler. Come up here. Toby, youre Toby. Andy, youre Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
  Toby, come on.
  Ready, one bullet. And boom!
  Leave, get outta here.
  Right now!
  Michael, nice tie or something.
  No.
  Alleged contract.
  Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, dont even need to make contact. The law will do it.
  So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
  How do we know this? Id like to see a stool sample.
  Eughh.
  Same page. Just keep moving.
  Which we cant know.
  Unless were unplugged.
  And wake up in the future.
  What?
  What?
  I dont have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I dont want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
  $30,000? Theres gotta be another way.
  Look, I will not pay.
  "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
  Agreed.
  Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
  But not in your bed. Its lumpy.
  Fine. Five times.
  No.
  Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
   I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I dont have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong,  but theyre no match for a grown Schrute man.    Lets see what she gets.   Aah!
  I could have stopped him.
  Are you warmed up?
  God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?
  Never mind. Just never mind.
  Oh, itll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. Its not in the contract.
 Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
 Hey, IT guy.
 Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
 Apache persuasion hold, thats the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
 Youre with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
 Hold that thought. I dont want to waste your time, and I wouldnt dare waste mine. I didnt do it. Now, I dont know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here...  You should fire the following people.
 Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
 Are you referring to alchemy?
 Im not dumb. Im smart.
  Let me give you a hand.
 Ready?  Got it? Oh shoot. Got it?  Dwight Schrute.
 Basement office? You mean like a lair?
 Okay.
 Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make em an offer they cant refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Dont call me til you have it.
 All right. Sounds good.
 Oh, just...
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Heres the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, Im going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
 Im about to buy this building, you know.
 Well, Im one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
