 Where?
 No need we can just check the security tapes.
 Its only Meredith.
 Hey... Why did you do it?
 Was she talkin back?
 Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
 Hey monkey, whats up?
 Sure.
 Check to see if shes faking. If a car hit me, it wouldnt crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
 So what do you need me to do?
 Mm-hmm.
 Hey monkey.
 Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
 Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
 That was the sick one, right?
 No.
 Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
 So... Hey come on, dont be sad, just... OK... just. Shes in a better place.
 Actually the place that shes in is the freezer, because of the odor.
 Shes only a cat.
 Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
 No, I have not.
 I do not respect her, but I will go.
 As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity were using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me whats unethical.
 Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
 Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
 Pfft... Her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
 Just doing my job.
 So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
 Mm-hmm.
 No, no. Youve gotta be bitten by something.
 Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
  Oww!
 Youre taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
  Youll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
 Well I dont know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
 Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, thats what you told me when I contributed.
 Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Merediths son.
 Mm-hmm.
 On your marks, get set...
 Youve got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Tobys coffee before the race.
 How ya feeling, better?
 Well you look cute as a button. Youve worked up quite a sweat.
 I am a farmer Angela.
 OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk dont have the stomach to do.
 I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
 It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
 Well Im not responsible for that!
 Hey, Oww!  Its OK.
 Its nothing, Im robbing her.
 Its fine. What?
 I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
 I know a great taxidermist. Ill pay to have her stuffed. Well hes not great, but hes pretty good.
 Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
 What?
 I dont see it. I think they both could do better.
 To give you this .
 Its a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and Im giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
 And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.  Dont you Garbage?
 You havent buried her yet?
 Garbage can be very helpful. OK, hes a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him.
 What if we dont want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
 Got it.
 Hello.
 Really?
 Ill make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
 Oh, yeah. Yes!
 Im gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
 Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
 Dry. Delicious.
 Oh, thats funny.
 Are you enjoying your mineral water?
 Then dont look in my eyes. Look right here , its an old sales trick.
 No, please dont do this, monkey.
 Dry rot?
 Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
 Youre welcome.
 Yes...  I miss you.
 Fine.  Then I just want to be friends.
 Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
 Michael, wait. Let me go.
 Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please.
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
  Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
 Ah, thats a pain in the ass.
 Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
 Why do you use that thing? Lets them know where you are at all times.
 The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
 Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
 And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
 Please, come back.
 Remember what we had Larry?
 I dont know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
 Like Angela in accounting.
 Ugh... no, shes wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
 You dont know?
 Hes not coming back, its over Michael.
 Accept it, why would he come back?
 Thats not gonna change his mind. Hes moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
  Well were O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
 Thats how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
 Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
 No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
 It cant mean that! Theres a lake there!
 This is the lake!
 No, its--- theres no road here!
 Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael!
 I got you, I got you!
 Fine.
 Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
 Ill call a cab.
 Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
  Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
 Yes!
 Take a stand!
 Its real simple. If you dont appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
 Can you call us a cab please, Im gonna  Oops, sorry!
 Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!
  Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
  Well bill you.
 What?
 I dont see it. I think they both could do better.
 To give you this .

  Well bill you.
  Thats ridiculous.  Im not going to be beaten by a website.
  Really?  Cause Ryan says so?
  I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
  You believe a computer can beat me?
  Well I will prove you wrong.
  Well see.
  Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
  Just ignore him.
  I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
  Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
  Got it.  Carb up.
 Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
 Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
  Today Im prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
  Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
  What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  Ill hold.
  It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
 Ohhhhhh!
  No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what Im suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  Thats exactly what youre not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh.
  Fine.  Good.
  Yeah.
  I do not look worried.
  What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
  Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
  Return it!  Return it now!
  Y... You dont understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, Im gonna tell it that you were responsible.
  I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
  Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than youre paying right now?  Its not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
  Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
  Im sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
  Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered womens shelter?
  Huh?!
  Did you see the board?
  Yes!
  Woo!
  Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
  No no no the first part.
  Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
  You didnt have to.
 I think shes efficient.
 I hadnt noticed.
||
 I think its inappropriate to date someone you work with.
 No.  I think you should date Kelly.
 Uh, she works in the annex.  Youre also welcome to date Toby.
 Ive seen this kid before. Hes one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
 Were a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
 What did you just call him?
 What did you say?
 I can make him talk, Michael.
 Listen up kid.    I dont like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
 Hey!
 Its just ice, itll melt all over the floor.
||
  If youre going number one youve got ten more seconds!
 Ahh-chaa!
 Im just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think youre going to do something to him.
 Shut up, or Im going to punch you in the throat!
 You had to, what other choice did you have?
 Well, yeah.
 What will you do?
 Yeah.
 So, Im paying full price?
 Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  Theres two more.
 Now what?
 Alright.  Oh, I assume Im going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
 Blah.
 Uhh.
 What?
 Coopers has calamari.
 Tokyo?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Nice.
 Woo-hoo.
 Yum.
 Later on.
  And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
 I started a fire with my cheese pita.
 I date Indian girls.
 Now Ive got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and Im your boss.
 I dont get that, I dont understand that.
 Yeah, lets go.
   Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold.  Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, Im sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that dont conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
 None of your business, Jim.
 It is not a B and B.
 Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
 Im not telling you anything.  Permits are pending.  Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
 Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
 Where did you read that?
 Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. Thats what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms youll ever see.
 How many in your party?
 We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps youll be interested in, um, Moses table making demonstration?
 One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
 You took that with you.
 You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didnt see it there.
 My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I dont care, theyre your oats.
 We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
 American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
 Ill put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
 No.
 No. Jim, come on.
 Mose, bags! Now!
 Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So Ill come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, well get that power back on. All righty.
 Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
  And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemorts surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
  Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
 Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
 Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
 Great.
 Oh. Well Ill look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
 Pam.
 I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
 Stupid.
 No.
 Maybe you should.  Whatever.
 Im glad you enjoyed your stay.
 Uhh-mmm
  No you didnt.
 Mmm-uh-mm
||
   Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
 Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesnt have points or scores, it doesnt have winners or losers.
 I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
 We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
 Angela can stay the same, but well change Andy to Dwight.
 Dwike?
 Yes.
 Andy, I cant hear this right now.
 She called you D?
 Oh D.
  Oh D.
 He looks like your twin.
 I will know.
 I wont need to because well be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
 Found him!
 Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
 Well, gee, Jim, I dont know, I guess theres no sales call today.
 Yow!
 Hes lying.
  Gah-ah-hah-ha!
 No communication with the outside world Jim.
 Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
 Or real bombs.
 Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
 Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, its going to be so badass.
 Im peeing in this empty can.
 Well you said that we couldnt make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
 Hey, youre making me spray!
 I think I cut my penis on the lid!
 Believe it.
 And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
 Then Ill grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
 Okay, Jim.
 Lets move! Move, move, move, move!
  We are climbing some stairs.
 Im breathing heavily.
 Well...
 Theres a security guard coming by.  Hello, were warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
 I can see the security guards eyes.
 I have to do something to his eyes.
 The eyes are the groin of the head.
 My hip bone!
 Dont leave us!
 Dont leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
 Im losing control of my bladder.
 Did you say Karen?
 Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
 Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
 Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
  Im on it.
 Lets see if any of these will work.
 I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jims life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, its dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "Its better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
 Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Lets put it this way no, I do not.
 No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
 I would make sure that you were dead.
 First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
 And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
 What are you doing?
 It would be better if you were unconscious.
 Do you want to do this right or not?
 Were here.
  Here we go. Just the two of us
 Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
 Keep going, youre fine. Just some bushes and some thickets  Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
 Good a spot as any.
 Im just --
 Spin. Im trying to confuse your sense of direction.  Behold.
 Heres your knife. Heres your duct tape.
 Good luck, Michael.
 I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
 Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I dont know what hes searching for out here.  I hope he finds it.  Lunch.
 About two more minutes .
 Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is...  on.
 Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo!  Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out.
 All right! What is going on here?
 I told you.
 All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, Jörg Roßkopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
 Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
 Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
 Thank you Michael.
 Michael, what time should I be arriving?
 Does it bother me that I wasnt invited to Michaels dinner party?
 Hello.
 We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
 So can we come in?
 Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
 Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
 Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. Ive seen you eat it many times.
 Purely carnal and thats all you need to know.
 Fine. Get outta here.
 Get out of my way, Ill take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
  Michael can come home with me.
 You people.  Come on. Youre sleeping with me.
 Im gonna take you home Michael.
 Alright.
  Write legibly people.
 OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
 I wrote that. Michael, you shouldnt have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
  That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
 The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information.  Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
 She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
 Why dont you sit down? Michael... come on.  Here we go. Yeah.
 Jim, how dare you.
 You know what you need? Closure.
 There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
 Come on. Ill drive.
 I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
 Yeah.
 She was stoned apparently.
 You wait until next years chair catalog comes out and you find someone whos still alive.
 Yeah.
 Rhythm and blues...
 Youve got a ton of dandruff.
 Taste good too.
 Wow! Lot of calories.
 Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
 Question.
 Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
 I dont understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
 Yeah!
 No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
  With sex!
 Fire hazard.
 Women look like white slaves.
 Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
 No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
 Do you live in a regular sized house?
 Good.
 Well its weevil season but we were prepared.
 They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
 Youve already been several times.
 Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
 Ill order you some cranberry juice.
  Do you have powers?
  Excuse me.
  How did you all find each other?
 Amazons.
 Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.  You two, Jersey State girls, lets go.
 OK. You know what, fine. Lets go, two girls to a guy. Come on, lets do it. Cmon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him . Lets go, cmon. Here we go.
 Wait, wait a minute, whats this, I didnt order this?
 Oh.
 Its not safe. Anything could have been in there.  Nice try.
 I do, I have to go.
 No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
 Uh huh.  Im not gonna call her.
 Wow.
 All right.
 Nice.
 I got sofa. I got sofa.
 I got floor.
  Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
 Its a lullaby.
 I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
 OK. Good night Ryan.
 Come on!
 Can you breathe?
 Hold your breath.
 Ready?
 And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can.
 Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
  Unh! Scratch.
 Uh, bumpers sagging.
 This cars crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
 Well, here are your options you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that youd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and Ill use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
 Yes.
 You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. Its gotta be now.
 Seal the deal. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Three, two, one--
 Five, four, three, two...
 Now. Now. Now.
 Say it. Do it. Now.
 Do it now.
 Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
 Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
 There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
 However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
 Menstrual cycles.
 You.
 Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
 All you have to do it say it.
 Just say it.
 Say it. Just do it. Dont think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
 So... All right, well, youre gonna have to deal with this yourself.
  Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! Whats Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
 Its my car now.
 Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if youll excuse me, Ive got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
 Ive got a Madlib for you a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
 Maybe hes going to church. Or court.
 Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  Excuse me where do you think youre going? Oh no, no, no. Youre not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will -  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
 I will tell on you.
 Thank you.
 Michael, I know youre swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
 So... what else is up?  Mich-
||
  Ah-choo!
 Thank you.
 Youre welcome.
  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute.  Hello?
 Hello? Hello?
 Jim, what are you doing?
 Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
  This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
  K, fine. Ill just let it go to voicemail.
 Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
