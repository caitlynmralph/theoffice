  Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum  I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
 Whassup!
 Whassup.
 What?
 Just clearing my desk. I cant concentrate.
 Its overlapping. Its all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
 You cant do that.
 Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
 Downsizing?
 Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
 Im Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
 OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
 Please, OK? Do you want me to tell em?
 OK. You tell em. With my permission. Permission granted.
 Go ahead.
 On his mothers grave.
 Pam, information is power.
 Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
 Uh... yeah I got a 78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. Its now worth three grand.
 New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. Ive got some photos.
 Damn it! Jim!
 He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
 Thats real professional thanks. Thats the third time and it wasnt funny the first two times either Jim.
 Its OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because its so relaxed. Im a volunteer Sheriffs Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. Thats sort of one of the rules.
 That is my stapler.
 OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him?
 Its always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
 Yeah.
 OK, thats great. I guess what Im most concerned with is damage to company property. Thats all.
 Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
 Retaliation. Tit for tit.
 Well, it should be.
 I have two. White and Indian.
 A few of the ground rules?
 OK, can we steer away from gay people?
 Im sorry. Its an orientation. Its not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
 I figured it would save time.
 Excuse me, Im sorry, but thats not all it takes to be a hero.
 A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
 A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
 We all have a hero in our heart.
 Lots of cultures eat rice, doesnt help me.
 Um... Shalom. Id like to apply for a loan.
 OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
 Outback steakhouse.  Im Australian, mate!
 Oh, man, am I a woman?
 Yes. I can do it. Im your man.
 OK, first, lets go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
 OK, well table that for the time being. Two, Ill need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
  Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his.
 OK, I take it back, its a workspace.
 Thank you.
 What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I dont believe in coddling people.
 In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I cant run. A lion eats me and Im dead." Well, Im not dead. Im the lion. Youre dead.
 Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
 Same thing.
 Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
 Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
 Yes. And my decision in final.
 Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
 Sure.
 Dont need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
 I dont need them. Superior genes. Im a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
 So I can lower it.
 Its a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
 Yeah, you said...
 I can handle that.
 OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what Id like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and Ill see what I can do.
 OK, well, I didnt say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, dont write any disease down at all and it wont be covered. Sound fair? Good. Ill be in my office.
 Damnit! Damnit Jim!
 All right, who did this? Im not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
 Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
 Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
 You did this, didnt you?
 Yes you did.
 I know it was you. Fine. You know what? Ill have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
 The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition wont receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.  "Count Choculitis"
 Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
 I think you need to confess...
 ...the fact...
 What are you doing? Those are my keys.
 Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...
 Let me out.
 Let me out or youre fired.
 Yes I can. Im manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
 Jim! Open the door!
 Jim!
 Jim!
 Jim!
 Jim!
 Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
 Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
 Dwight Schrute.
 Well...
 He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
 Thats not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
 Yeah.
 Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
 Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your...
 Michael. Michael?
 I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
 Im now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
 You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
 I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
 OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. Ill make sure thats covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
 Yeah, but no one here has it.
 I most certainly did not.
 Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
 Michael!?
 I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
 I, but if there were, Id be protected as assistant regional manager?
 Yeah, so I dont have to worry?
 Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
 Its a real shame, cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
 I didnt do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? Whats the scuttlebutt?
 Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
 Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
 Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out whos vulnerable and whos protected...
 Did you get your tickets?
 The gun show.
 Theres one other thing and this is important. Lets keep this alliance totally a secret. Dont tell anyone.
 Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
 Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
 Just now.
 Right, thats good, good, pursue this.
 Mmm hmm.
 Done.
 They seem awfully chummy, dont you think?
 Only one way to find out.
 What? I believe it.
 I could tell, from the body language.
 Good, let em. It helps our cause.
 Oh, theyre forming an alliance
 Damn it. God!
 God... Damn it! Why us?
 Jackpot.
 Hey, you wanted to see me?
 I dont think shed be missed.
 Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
 She had a hysterectomy.
 Thats where they remove the uterus.
 It could be kind of funny.
 Oh my God, we have to be there.
 No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
 I know. I know exactly what to do.
 Im a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
 This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
 So tape it down.
 Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, Ill poke holes in the box.
 No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people dont notice were both gone.
 Can I trust Jim? I dont know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I dont. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
  Oh.
 I have absolutely no idea.
 Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. Thats the game. Convince him were in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
  Thats politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
 Michael!
 Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
 Oh, please.
 I apologized for that.
 Michael, I...
 I can handle that.
 And thats why you have an assistant regional manager.
  Same thing.
 Its close.
 So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
 Gimli.
 Just trying to be helpful.
 Michael, look.
  OK, well be skins!
 What? Shirts on or off?
 You sure?
 De-fense!   De-fense!
  Yeah!  In your face!
  Yes!
 Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.
 Sex.
 Torture.
 Cocks in the henhouse.
 So am I.
 Doesnt matter.
 The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
 Hmmm... shes been talking to Michael a lot.
 Assistant to the Regional Manager.
 Thats true.
 True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
 Whats that?
 I dont want a purse. Purses are for girls.
 No.
 Like those?
 Okay, Im just going to use the bathroom, and then Im going...
 Its actually better this way.
 Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know its against the rules and everything. Because...
 Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
 What?
 Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
 Please. Please, I am your inferior and Im asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
 You cannot promise me, or you wont promise me?
 Do you love her?
 Hey, hows it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
 It will just take a second.
 Just for a minute.
 Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
 Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
