 From now on, if youre hot, sit on an ice pack.
 Like youd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? Im too busy.
  Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
 Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
 The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
 Where?
 Give me that.
 Yes.
  Hey, whats so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys.  Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
 Whos gonna tell on us? Gabe?
 How close?
 Yes. Of course.
 Hey, did you SMS text message me?
  Okay, thats weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
 Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us!   Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
 Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
 Use your talons! Pry em open!
 Well, dont look, freak!
 Ive got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
 How ya doin?
  Wow. Late every day this week.
  Why didnt I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
  Now that I own the building, Im looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha  Well I guess its not an evil idea. Its just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
  Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
  You remember my cousin Mose.
  Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
  Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters.  I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
  Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a childs imagination thats Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
  Oh! That shouldnt have been in there. Im embarrassed.
  We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
  No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
  What?
  Oh no, no, no.
  I promise you, that door locks!
  Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
  All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
  Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
  You dont want to know.
  What?
  Yes I did. And Im going to do the same with all of your clients.
  Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! Theyre "appearance"ists!
  You guys know me. You know that Im not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
  I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess Im not the kind of guy thats good enough for precious heirlooms.
  Ok
  Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980s, Beautiful Girl...
  Apparently, its one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That cant be right. Andy? How does it...?
  Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
  Really?
  Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
  I cant see.
  Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"
  Copy. Thank you.
  Please.
  Thank you.
  What?
  Do you have your card?
  It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
 Because Im here for one thing. Revenge.
  Excuse me sir.
  I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
  You work on commission, dont you?
  Good Morning!
  What?
  It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
  Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... Im gonna... Ok. Listen. You cant treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
  You made a big mistake. Huge!
  Aaah!
   Ill take the wizard!
 Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
 Please, waste of time. You know what? Lets just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
 Angela? Dont like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
 Give me the punch card.
 That is not in the contract.
 Alright, fine. Ill go to your little show, but Im not wearing a cape.
  I work with that guy.
 Too bad Im not gonna explain anything that you miss.
  His names Andy. Hes a terrible salesman.
 Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
 Lets go.
 All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
 All right, lets do this.
 Its okay, I smell.
 No, no, no. Contractually were obligated to have sex.
 I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you...  Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it.
 Good night.
  Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on!  Que? QUE?
 I pick up day laborers and tell them theyll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them its Canada.
 Hola, tu es une buena worker?
 Y el accento, donde are you from?
 You speak English?
 Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
||
 That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And youll be happy to know that hes taking care of that hornets nest that youve been griping about.
 Poor hornet.
  I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly hell conquer the hornets...
 Hell die.
 When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
 Interesting choice...
 A bat! Impressive...
 Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
 What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
 You may have...
 You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
 You need to contact every woman youve been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. Its the right thing to do.
 Then I will.
 No, Im no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, Im no doctor. Im just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
 So long Donna!
  He forgot to mention the herpes.
 I dont understand the reference.
 We had to come over right away, its urgent. Michael has something to tell you.
 Ok Im gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater thats open to visitors? Never mind Ill find it.
 Next stop is Helene. Youre gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. Ill remind you.
 Jan knows paper.
 Wait, what Holly said?
 Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
 Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
 TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
 Come on old lady. Lets go.
 Come on.
 Michael!
  Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didnt they?
 It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
 Im gonna need a list of every man youve ever had sex with. Im talking train stations, mens rooms...
 Fence with a hole in it..
 The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folks home.
 The democratic primaries,
 Cant beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
 Yeah!
 How do I look?
 Normal. Ugly.
 Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! Its weird if I come in slightly after.
 We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
 Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think theyll understand? Its condescending.
 And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
 No.
 No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
 Go tell her were here. Youre good with receptionists.
 Crap.
 Danny Cordray is the worst.
 The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
 Also, he slept with Pam.
 Im gonna intimidate him. Okay?
 Watch this.
  So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. Thats why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
 What are you doing?
 Like hell you are.
 Hes not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
 Whatd he say? What did he say?
 There he is.
 Ive been in showtime mode since breakfast.
 Hes not kidding.
 Oh.
 Jim talked too much.
 Yes, you did.
 I know how we can learn his tricks.
 What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
 Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
 The Sting. The Sting.
 Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
 People cant keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
 Hes very, very handsome.
 Oh...
 Oh, man!
 I told you! Youre an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
 Then make him pitch to you.
 We gotta see what hes got.
 Okay, and remember-youre not gay.
 Okay. Youre a young hotshot from Stark Industries. Youve just bought this company. Meredith is fired. Its a whole new regime. Hes gotta pitch to you now.
 Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
 No!
 Michael?
 Can I talk to you about something?
 Its about this very announcement you just made.
 Michael-
 Wheres he gonna sit? Theres no more seats.
 Wheres he gonna park? Theres no more reserved parking spots.
 You snubbed her.
 Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesnt wear makeup?  We like her better that way! And you steal clients, dont you? Dont you!
 Oh, thats different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay.  So...youre gonna be workin here?
 Welcome aboard.
 Its after 500, Jim. Im not gonna take this home.
 Pleasure.
  So long, Stanley!
  Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, youd be so strangled right now. If youre out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
 To my chickens Im the Scranton Strangler.   Oh-ho! Thats very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrutes mom.
 Youre only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
 Lake Erie.
 Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
 He went to Gabe behind your back.
 He went over your head to go behind your back.
 No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We cant have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
 Yeah. Heres another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryls idea.
 Garbage magnet.  Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you dont need to tart them up with some design.  I cant believe this doesnt make you mad!
 Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
 Lets just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
 I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
 Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania?  Cause of the euro.
  Uh...
 NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
 The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
 Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
 Yes. I would welcome it.
 The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I dont know why everyone doesnt do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
  For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
 Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
 Opus dei.
 Shh, shh, shh.
 Greg, hello, its Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
 I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
 Ill call you back.
 Michael, Im just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
 Gah!
  They shouldnt televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
 Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now thats a show Id watch.
 Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
 Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didnt follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
  Kelly. Kev-  Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to?  In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. Ive been raising children since I was a baby.
 That would be nice wouldnt it?
 You know its not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabes refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, shell be happy for hours.
 Really? Oh... Then here we are.
 She loves me.
 Well somethings come up, I have to go.
 I have something to do.
 I do. But you married my worst enemy.
 Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
 From Jim.
 Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
  Insert it in my mouth.
 No, try me.
 Id prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
 No. Crust first.  Okay, now the beer.  Beer me Jim.  Ssss. Gentle.  Now Ive gotta go meet Angela.
 I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
 Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. Were in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
 Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
 You ever been with the blondes before? Its the big leagues.
 Shes in heat. She will eat your face off!
  A single piece of pepperoni please.
 What are you doing?
  Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up.  Everyone, follow me to the shelter. Weve got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
 Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
 Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
 Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
 All Right
 Yes.
  Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
 Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But thats all behind us. Hay Place lives on!  Watch it, watch it.
 Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
 Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 200, and the Goat Roast is at 300. Come on in, enjoy!
 Roll in the hay, five dollars.
 Oh, our contract.
 Yes, why dont we meet at the usual spot.  Uh... Ive got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
 So, uh...  Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
  Hey kids, was that fun?
 All Right!
 Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldnt get me off the hayride! But its gonna cost you three more bucks.
 Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
 Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
 Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
 Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
 And now, by show of applause, We will crown this years hay king. All in favor of Purebred.  Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread.  And lets hear it for... Purebred.  Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick...  Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!
 Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
 Angela?  Angela!
||
 Twenty minutes a day Jim, thats all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and Ill have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and youll be sitting there like an idiot.  Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes.
 Im sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
  D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
||
  Uhh, aah!
||
 Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. Ive surrounded the enemy, and Im slowly starving them. To save on electricity Ive installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. Its part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
 China is on the move?
 Im sorry, isnt that good enough for your anus? Dont get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
 Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
 "Which is you" is not a sentence.
 Pam, when Im sitting at this desk, Im a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
 Well then youre not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear hes a very reasonable guy.
  Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her Im busy. I dont know, make something up.
 You know what Pam? Youre right. This isnt just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.
 I say we bomb em. By 2020, theyre gonna be the worlds largest economy and theyre getting a taste for protein. Well all starve.
||
 Or else? Or else what? Theres nothing you can do.
 Waste of time.
 Let me see.
 You cant just move out.
 In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? Im putting together kind of a wish list.
 Yeah, no. Im not a genie. Im just talking about a...
 You cant possibly be serious.
 Parley, my office, five minutes.
 Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
 Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
 You dont wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. Youll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
 Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
 Theres no building. This could only mean one thing.
 She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
 What?
 Oh.
 Im sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
 So, okay. Youre not a liar too are you?
 Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
 I cant wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
 Hey Pam.
 Yknow what, Im the only one here who you havent asked about the new office.
 Yeah, but Im still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. Whats the square footage in the new place?
 Whats the exact square footage.
 How many offices are there? Oh Ill just look at the one sheet myself.
  Youre a funny guy Pam. Whats the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? Im going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I cant believe this is real, but it is." I cant wait.
 Impossible, I love the law.
 I see Ive underestimated you, and I didnt think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
 Reply it!
 They say the best vampires dont bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
 Ill tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
 You are?
 Let me see you jump.  Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isnt one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
 Oh come on.
  Oh, my God! Its the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? Its not even a real snow. Look, its a dusting. Pitiful.
 Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
 Look at that. Theres a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
 You apologize to me right now.
 You apologize right now.
 Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
 No, Andy, its a snowball fight. Its not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.  Jim, let go. Let go.
 Pam?
 Death to Toby!
 Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
 Okay.
  Youve reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave...
 Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
 Ahh!
||
 I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
  Haahh!!
||
 Oh, no. Oh, no!
 Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
 Huh? You like that?
 Huh?
 Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
 I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
 With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
 Wait, what girlfriend?
 I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
 Dear God in heaven.
 Okay, hey, hey, hey...
 Didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
 I do not accept your surrender. Theres only one way that I would ever relent.
 You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
 Ill take that as a no.
 In the end, the greatest snowball isnt a snowball at all. Its fear. Merry Christmas.
 Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
 This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
 Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. Were often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
 No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
 What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leaders weird voice? Huh?  Dwight, dont be bothered by the . Over the line, Jim.
 Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. Thats our official name, Jim.
 Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
 And the rest was just stuff.
 Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
 It was pretty awesome.
 Wow. Did your baby draw that?
 Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She cant keep those mittens on forever.
 Not doing that.
 Ive achieved plenty and theres no better than the best.
 Wait, its that easy? Thats not a resolution, thats just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that...  My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
 Yeah.
 Awesome.
 Its that easy?
 Okay, Ill drive.
 Ill take the entirety of the second floor.
 Welcome.
 Is that what we were doing?
 Good. Real good.
 Yeah, yeah!
 Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Lets roll.
 Okay. Whatd you get?
 Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
 I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
 Come on, why not? Ive never been in one before. Im tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
 Well, we cant just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
 Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
 Gentlemen.
 Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
 Yeah!
 Hey.
  How are the marks?
 What are some of your small business ideas?
 Thats great. Theres a big, big future in that.
 Um, what about you?
 Uh-huh.
 Wow!
 Right. Okay? Great.
 You promised us whales. These are worms.
 Were no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
 So whats your crazy business pipe dream?
  Really?
  Phyllis?
 Some of these people are for real.
 Hey, friend. Hows it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
 Hey, you know what? Good news. Were back in. Lets go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
 I got it. I got it.
  Youre gonna blow it.
 Andy. I didnt think you had it in ya.
 Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. Im going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
 Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type marsupial.
 Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
 Alright. Dont get a swelled head. Youre no tracker.   Lets ride.
 Has Michael checked in?
 I asked you a question.
 Goodbye.
 Pam, this isnt a shopping trip.
 This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
 Pam, Im obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
 No word from Michael.
 Hey.
 Theres too many brands. Wheres Holly?
 Hey!
 What are you doing?
 Tootenbacher.
 Of course. He was here. Shes the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
 Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
 Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him.  This way, this way, this way? I dont know. Do you know?
 Hes heading downtown.
 Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird thats chirping to you, "this way, this way"?
 Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael were coming for you!
 All right then. Someone propose a plan.
 Not you, Erin.
 That is the stupidest idea Ive ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
 Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... Im deep below the oceans surface in a submarine. A torpedos coming right at me. No. Damn it, thats just my own imagination.  Maybe hes bowling.
 Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. Ill fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didnt really.
 Youre just filling that out right now. That wasnt meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
 Michael. Confession I have done PDA in the office.
 Ive had intercourse in the office.
 As has Angela!
 As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed.  As has Michael and as has Holly.
 Michael, thats absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
 And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
 Yes!
 Hey. Hey. Come on. Youre hurting him.
 Shh.
 Just hush.
 Just rock. Shh.
 Movie idea?
 Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
 Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
 I dont know.
 Do the monkey face!
 Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
 Go back to the monkey!
 Hurl your feces.
 Good.
 They really do that.
 My perfect Valentines Day? Im at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
 I play Samuel, Michael Scarns robot butler. I wanted Samuels voice-  to be like this!  But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
 He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
 No no, hes doing it to catch the president!
 I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything thats about to expire. Its nice not to have to plan my meals.
 Theyre still good for another week.
 Hardy har har. Okay picture this Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. Theres only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
 No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlords gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. Its just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
 Could be.
 I can see that happening, yes.
 Thats a realistic time line.
 Perhaps.
 I can see that as a very real possibility.
 I can see that happening.
 Whys he talking to Holly?
  Holly, you approved this?
 I didnt order anything.
 Well theres a lot of seats in the annex.
 I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
 No it is not.
 I dont wanna move desks!
  Hey, whos dirt box is this?
 What do you grow in here, bullcrap?
 Kevin, in sumo culture, youd be considered a promising up and comer.
  Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
 Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you Im cool. Youre the new guy. Its cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
 Drink it!
 None of your business.
 It wasnt poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
 Really.
 I know.
 Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
  Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldnt annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
 Who is Justice Beaver?
 Why dont you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
 Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and Ill read it over.
  There are over four hundred of these!
 Theyre all good. So good! Number three eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four eat a dog. I dont know, um, from practical stand point-
 Eat a brog. Maybe its because I didnt understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.  Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
  And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
 Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
 Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and well get ya back!
 He took my desk.
 It wasnt my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
 No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what were doing.
 People! Look alive. Its showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
 Its good that its cold it will drive business inside.
 The warmth will lure people inside.
 This is how business...
 Im not closing the door.
 Stop it.
 Uh oh, looks like someones sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
 Not so fast.
 Schrutes are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
 I will trade you for the used candle.
 Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
 Thats how its done.
 Oh, cause theres a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
 People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and youre like Hey baby let me light a candle then you pull out this one half used and hes like Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.
 And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
 What is this?
 Professor Copperfields Miracle Legumes?
 Thats a common swindlers trick.
 So you wanna sell me magic beans.
 Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
 You got this kosher certified?
 Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects.
 Oh, its just Stanleys old photo album. Im thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. Im not James Franco.
 things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Merediths junk for Kellys crap for Phyllis garbage for Oscars trash for Stanleys garbage for Ryans junk for Creeds garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
 Jim, put those away.
 just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
 I know right... what the?
 That... thats impossible.
 All right, Ill take them.
 Probably.
 I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasnt the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
 Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
 Thanks for meeting me.
 Theres no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
 Thats because Im your right-hand man, Michael, but I cant do it again. I cant do it again for a whole new guy.
 I want to be manager. I just dont understand why I wasnt even interviewed for the job. Whats wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
 How do I become a manger at Sabre?
 I left a message at corporate.
 Cant you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
 From when he recommended me to replace him.
 Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
 Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
 Every day is black tie optional!
 Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
||
 Appalling.  Eye sore.  Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
 Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott.  Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers!  Was that part of the...?
 Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
 Big smiles folks! There they are.
 We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
 I thought it was the worst Dundies Ive ever been to.
 Gladly! Id accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
 I just dont see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
 And next time, why dont you pick a co-host, that doesnt have microphone-a-phobia!
  Michael?
 Ive got a treat for you!
 Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
  Thats because theyre Not oysters, theyre bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning!  Hah!
 What is wrong with you? Im the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didnt recommend me?!
 Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
 Great idea.
 Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
 Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand?  Youre like a giant walking salami!
 Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
 Ive given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
 Yes.
 This is gonna be good.  To whom it may concern.  Good, real personal. Thanks Michael.  The dictionary defines superlative as of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme.  Thats great, if I wanted the dictionary definition Id buy a dictionary.  I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme.  Lots more like that, really repetitive. Whats this?  Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball.  Ohhh, yeah.
||
||
  Uh oh...
 Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.
 Its just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once youve seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because its so much fun.
 I think youll find what youre looking for  over there.
 Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
 Im just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why dont you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
 What?
 No youre not.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Whats the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
  No!
 So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
 Really?  Anything.
 Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
 Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, Id lock Mose in the chicken coop.
 Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
 No, you cant get flowers for someone whos in a coma. Theyll wilt before he wakes up.
 Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
  Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you.  Jordan, gather my things from my desk.
 Mose... youll never guess where I am right now.
 Excellent. Morning announcements! Theres been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Dont share it.  Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
 Thats on a need-to-know basis.
  General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
 Define foment.
  Please take note of the new color-coding system.
  Aha!
 Gotcha! Why are you late?
 All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think youre doing? Whats this? Whats the Fist?
 You expect me to believe that youre starting a rebellion?
 Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
 I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
 Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranhas a rescue.
 The desk is a replica of Uday Husseins desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, Im a very busy man. Lets get right down to business.
 Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that youll be on your best behavior.
 Dont make me fire you.
 Dont make me pre-fire you.
 Watch this. Youre pre-fired. And when Im promoted, youll be full fired.
 What?
 How you doing, Jordan?
 Everyone here thinks that youre a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which wont last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, youll age swiftly and poorly.
 Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they dont want me to know abou- Ohh... its a holster.
  Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin good.  Ohh...  Oh, what a day. What a day.
 The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I dont know. I guess hes saying that hes proud of me.
 The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I cant walk around wearing an empty holster.
 Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
 Uh... hello!
 Why would I put a banana in my holster?
 Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!
 No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. Thats all we know! No. Thats not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
 Okay, why are you calling Jo?
 Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
  Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo!  Howdy, partners! Its me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And Im the rootin-est--  I cant do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and Im launching a full investigation.
 Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andys tie look like?
 I have no way of knowing if thats true.
 Okay, really?
 Come on.
 I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
 Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But dont cross me. But youre the best.
 There he is! Our hero!  You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
 Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
 American Idol? What? No.
 No.
 Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
 I put everything back in the vending machine.
 Okay.
 Thank God.
 Whats jazz hands?
 Fine.
||
 Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
  Well, what can you do? Life.
 Oscar, can you print out last years sale statements?
 No, Kevin, come on.
 Kevin, not now.
 Okay, okay. Shh!
 Youre kidding me.  Oh God, what am I touching? Its moist.
 Oh, its so wet.
 I cant. I cant push harder!
 Okay, hows that?
 Im kneading it!
 Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
 I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All Ive ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
 It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
 I take full responsibility.
 Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
 Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
 Got it.
  Jo, please... I will -
 Shut up.
  They wont make me manager, and I wont settle for anything less. Ive gone about as far as I can here. Thats obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
  Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview?  What are you doing..?  Stop trying to figure me out.
  You cant.
  No, its not.
  Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper? How its made?
   Get out.
  Im gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? Thats because I just threw it in the ring.
   I want an interview.
   Hows the family?
  Good. They good?
  Whats your daughters name again? Peepee?
  Peepa, how is she?
  Great! Oh, thats great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
  Now, listen,...
  Okay, I know why youre saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
  Im going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwights Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
  Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
  Ha ha!
  Fine. Ill do it without you, but youll regret this.
  Let me get that for you.
  Okay.
   Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because Ive learned so much from them. Id like to be interviewed for the position.
  Okay.
  Its complicated.
   Assistant Regional Manager.
   Assistant Regional Manager.
   Assistant Regional Manager.
  Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo...  Its me. Im Dwight.
   Yeah.
  I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager youd ever seen!
  Yes.
  Silence?
  Dwight Schrute.
  You have to interview me...
  I demand more questions!
  Okay! If youre not going to interview me, then Ill do it.
  What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again?  Thats a great question.  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
  Thank you.  Youll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think youre gonna like the call youre going to receive.  Oh, come on. Im just happy that I got this meeting.
  Well, its not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someones getting a little power-mad.
  What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
  Were gonna miss you, Gabe.
  I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or...  I dont know. Something always works out.
