   Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasnt strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, Ive been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still havent seen the beach.  Its nice to have visitors.
 Hi, Micha-
 Well thanks Michael.
 Well thats sweet, I missed you guys too.
 Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
 ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
 It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
 And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
 Are you all right, Michael?
 Hey guys thats really inappropriate.
 Im not going to punch you, Michael.
 No, why would I punch you?
 Hey, what is this?
 Why?
 Hey, whats going on?  You dont have my permission to do this.
 Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
 Dont search my stuff.
 I have a reasonable right to privacy.
 Michael!
 Oh my God!
 That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
 That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
 What is going on here?
 Of course not!
 I didnt put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
 Did you?
 You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
 I did leave.
 Well, I dont see it that way.
 What?
 We should really have the offices air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
 Youll see.
 Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Merediths work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
 Michael, We should contact some experts.  You dont know what your doing.
 Okay you know, this-- this is over.
 Sure. Wow.  Ow...
  Hey Sasha, its daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
 No, No, No.  No, Im just curious if youve heard of it.
 This is great.  My ex-wifes going to be so pissed.   For once daddys gonna be a hero.
 Hey, Id like to buy one of your dolls.
 Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
 I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
 But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- Im-- Im begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
 I only have $200.
  Oh man, thanks, thank you,  thank you, thank you.
 Oh thanks.  Shes gonna...  oh...
  No.  Its even-- its even better than the one I wanted.
  Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, its not great, but its something to watch.  And when its over youre like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
 Not much? Whats up with you?  Nah its okay. Im in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? Its so good. No, you gotta tune in, its as good as anything on HBO.  Hey does blue go with tan?
 I have like, like a blue shirt? I dont wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
 You have to stop.
 Cant you just not look at his feet?
 Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldnt say I have a passion for H.R.
  I could loan you a pair of socks.
 No, theyre clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
 Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
  Your outfit.
 You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  Its ri--its riding up a little high.
  All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
  All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
 Im running this meeting.
 Its not.  Its not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
  Casual Fridays are cancelled.    Lets just not do it anymore.
  Theres not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
 Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
 Really, really funny.
