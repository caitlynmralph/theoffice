 Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
 Yeah, Im really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
  Whats something that you...
  Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but Ive got a chance to do some good here.
  We can do this with more privacy.
  Id like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, its the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
  Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
  What?
  Ok, I cant count the hour if you dont talk.
  Michael, its up to me to check off the boxes, and I cant do that unless I honestly...
  Tell me!
  I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
  Of course.
  Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
  Oh.
  You know what Michael? Youre right. You win. This is pointless. Were not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why dont we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
  We can play something more complicated if you like.
  So you have played it before?
  Whos Jeff?
  So, her husband, your stepdad?
  Did you guys do much stuff together?
  Its working. Im doing it!
  Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
  Why?
  Dogs dont do that.
  I dont know.
  Its very important for you to be liked, isnt it?
  Im just trying to help you Michael.
  I just want to...
   Just fill them out any way you want.
  Ill have Erin fax them back to corporate.
  Yes.
  He seems fine.
  Heh.
  You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
  You remember that.
  Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
  Its a great stick, right?
 Thanks!
 No.
 Oh.
 Sunday church service... its been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
  Okay, this is, all right, this is silly.   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
  Why you always got to be so mean to me?
 Hi guys.
 Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Ill be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
 Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
 Okay, thats hurtful talk. Weve talked about that. You know, I dont interrupt your announcements.
 Well, I really cant talk about it, but its a very high profile case.
 Yes.
 I dont know.
 Come on.
 Guys, its a really big deal.
 I can neither confirm nor deny this. Lets just say Ill be up to my neck in jury duty.
 Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
 Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
 Yeah, uh, shell be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Uh, were on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
 I cant talk about it or Ill get removed from the jury.
 I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, were just talking.
 Oh, Jim. Hey.
 Theres this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
 Who looks exactly like you.
 Yeah. No, its uncanny.
 What?
 No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
 No, they bring it in.
 In meetings.
 I really disagree with this. I think its kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That mans being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and Im not so sure hes guilty any more.
 Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
  Okay.
  Heres the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
 Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
 Well, no. He hates jams.
 Thanks.
 Hey, what happened?
  Oh, I should get the accident report binder. Ive never used the gun violence forms before.
 I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?
 Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
 Oh, theres a whole nother terrorism booklet for that.
 Uh, well, we probably dont want to go just on seniority.
  Im sorry, what is your three-step plan?
   W-What?
  How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
  Uh... Human Resources.
  Yes.
  So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
  Well, its one of my strengths, but its the managers job.
  Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
  Im sorry, if we did something to upset you, Im sure it was inadvertent.
  I didnt think you were.
  But there arent...
  Well, we could try him out for a little while...  and if it doesnt work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
  No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk.
