 Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiancÃ© Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
 Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
 Theres two new guys back there with me now. Theyre in their 20s. And we really get along.
 Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
 Hey you wanted to see me?
 You can only fire Nellie for cause.
 Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
 Cant. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
 This is a bloodbath. Alright, Im calling this.
 It is enough of this. Everyone, lets go back to work.
 I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
  John Stamos.
 Johnny Depp.
  Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
 Uh-huh.
 Its an EMF hotspot.
 You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
 Hey.
 Are... are you me?
 Oh my goodness, look. Look at this.
||
 Look at.. Look at me.
 Yeah.
 Kevin.  His gambling problem mustve resurfaced. Im gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
 Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
 How?
 So you set him up.
 I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
 A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
 I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
 Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
 I have very fertile hair glands.
 I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
 We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
  Smile if you love mens prostates.
 This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
 That is-- that is a loaded question.
 He said that?
 I-- I dont know if theres truth to-- to, uh, to that.
 Oh... uh...
 I dont...
 They dont have vaginas.
 No. Theyre just regular men.
 Uh... wow....
 You know whos not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because hes in prison  for something he may not have done.
 The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Havent I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
 I--I could--I could talk about it.
 I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
 Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
 Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesnt add up. It was one quarter and--
 What? I was just explaining--
 Why wouldnt it--
 But why?
 Are you gonna kiss me?
 Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
  So proud of you, Hon.
 Im just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
 Petes a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
 Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
 Mm-hmm.
 Lady...you never stop surprising me.
  You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
 Uh... it... compliment...
 There were two or three sorrys in there.
 You cant fire Pete. You understand why, right?
 Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You cant just get rid of people over grudges.
 Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
 Its just boiler plating, you dont have to read it.
 I already signed it. I was just showing you.
 Andy, its not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy.  Its the original.
 Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. Its the shortest month but it sure doesnt feel that way. We should catch up.
 Yknow Ive been going over my notes from the trial...
 ...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
 ...minor points.
 Ive been drafting a letter.
 Im going to the prison. This afternoon. Im gonna talk to the strangler.
 Well I just wanted to say Im doing it.
 Hi, Im uh, Toby Flenderson. Im here to see George Howard Scubb.
 This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it?  I think this is a start of my first friendship.
 He- he cant do that.  Turns out shes allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesnt become a violation until she physically acts on it.
  A little ironic that Im going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel  was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
 Oh, sure.
 Lets do it. Lets get personal.
 Whoa.
 Oh, yeah, no, its okay. I can handle it. Um, so
||
 Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam arent in couples counseling, are you? Oh, God.
 Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So sâ€”hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
 Yes, it is your mistake. Hes lingering. So annoying. Im gonna kill him. How can I help? Im here.
 Youre really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
 He might start by asking each of you, â€œWhy do you think youre here?â€
 Well, whats a little while?
 I mean, whats the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesnt know when its gonna end.
 Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
 They do. That they do.
  That they do.
 Good morning.
 Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep.
 Ow! Ow!
  Im sorry!
 Andy?
 You wanted to see the gooey eye.
 Alright, its getting gooier so well just do it later.
 Okay, then, Andy.
 Andy, you know I cant do that. Itd be lying.
 Yeah, Imâ€”
 I cant.
  Oh, come on. Andy, no.
 No, no.
 No, no. Andy.
 Yeah. Yeah, I dont think
 Hello!  Hello!
 Hi!
 Oh.
 Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
 Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
 [alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know â€˜cause they have to give you one months notice before they leave.
 Yes.
||
  Its everything.
 Good luck.
 Oh, I dont know. I might turn in early.
 Yeah. Ill stop by.
