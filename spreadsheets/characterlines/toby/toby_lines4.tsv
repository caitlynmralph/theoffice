 No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredos Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
 Yeah.
 Oh, Michael, you cant ask about religious beliefs...
 Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
 Hey!
 Im makin great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
  And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
 Where are we?
 He couldnt have made it a circle?
 Ohh.
 Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
 ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind its not appropriate to, to do that.
 Ok, look the memo is not about you...
 Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
 Yes.
 Hey...  you two.
 Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know  relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, theres no need, really.
 Uh huh.
 Lets just wait and see what happens.  You know?
 Lets just wait.
 Technically, hes right.
 Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
  This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
 Absolutely.
 I just really like you.
 Have a great day!

 It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
 To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
 I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
 Alright, just know that youre not in the Finer Things Club.
 Fun?
 Really?
 What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
 Did you even read it?
 Who was the main character?
 I really didnt think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
 Oh, it wasnt camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat.
 Michael.
 Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
 Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many smores, that I finally had to say, "No more smores, no more smores."
 Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience
 Michael wasnt invited.
  Hey Jim.
 Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
 Yeah...
 My birthday was two months ago.
 There was no party.
 Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 458 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
 I dont know, I just thought you could include me.
 I just though you could add me.  I dont see the harm in that.
 Im allergic to mushrooms.
 Michael, Im your HR Rep. Im on your side.
 Um, can you make it eleven?
  ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what youre going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I dont know, I didnt want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted...
  Excuse me.
 I might have it in here.
 Its so random that I have it.
 When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
 No.
 Sorry guys, but I dont think I tipped him for last years.
 Hey, look what I found in the back.  Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
 Course you do.
 More like "Everyone lets get your boss laid Saturday."   I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And Im finally gonna do it. So, Im just gonna hop the fence and jog home now.
 Can I talk to you a second?
 Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
 Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
 Yeah.
 He didnt seem like he was joking.
 Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
 Um, why dont you go ask him that?
 You know, Michael, sometimes my daughters stomach hurts when theres a mean girl at school...
 Id say all the goofing around at Pams desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
 Well, you can actually fire him.
 Morning.
 Good morning, Kelly.
 Fine. Good.
 As part of my last day Im training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
 So this is H.R. This is your desk.
 Yeah, its great, isnt it?
 Hey, Stanley...
 I want to introduce you to...
 Hey Michael.
 Id like to introduce you to my replacement.
 Come on.
 Michael Scott, this is Holly.
 Nothing.
 Youre-youre not in it.
 I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
 No, uh...  Does anyone have a camera here?  No one has a camera here. Uh...
 Im gonna... Ill go get one. Stay.
  Whatd you guys do?
 Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
  Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
 Hi Pam. Stay.
 Im Toby.
 This place, um...
 Ive got some ideas, I guess...
 Well let me see... I would, uh...
 I guess everythings okay.
 I made it this far, right? Whats the point?
  "Suck on this."
 Thanks, Im gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
 I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldnt-
 Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I dont have a picture of the two of us.
 Yeah, could we...
  This one right here.
 Its digital, so just take as many as you want.
 Thanks...  Really, Michael?
 Its not.
  Oh, some kind of... alarm.
