 I should not be here. Im in the- I was in the wrong- Im- Im sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
 Guys. Really, its ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I dont think theres any reason for anybody to worry.
 I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
 Chicken piccata, side salad.
 I thought I was T-Dog.
 I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh.  Flenderson files.
 If I won the lottery, I dont know. I dont think Id make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
 Hey, where do I park?
 Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
 Its probably okay...
 I think its better that I...
 Its a finicky car...
 Its a little tricky, you might have to... take...
 Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You cant bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back Im gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. Im a lucky turkey.
 If you turn out the lights well do a little dance.
 Great.
 So great.
 Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
 ...bones. What?
 What... you cant... Gabe? Are you...
 For you?
 Who are you seeing? Thats gr
 Oh.
 You know I dont have to do the paperwork unless youre actually dating.
 But I meanuh have you talked to her? Is sh
 Do you know her last name, yet?
 Shes going to be screaming her own last name?
 Good luck Gabe.
 Its going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
 Radiant.
 You know its not just pregnant women who dont get their due. You know whos gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
 You know what would be the hottest thing ever? Its a pregnant Helen Mirren.
 Did you bring your passport with you?
 Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
 No.
 Oh my god.
 You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
 Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and hes also the worlds leading Egyptologist.
 No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
 Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
 ..Chad Flendermens kryptonite.
 Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
 Note? Its a symphony.
 I would love that.
 Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess Im through the gateway now, though, right?
 Bears.
 To madness.
 And I am Bacchuss friend!
 Mineral-ey.
 You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernestos.
 You mean food truck. Ernestos was a food truck.
 Ernesto!
 Yeah, hey.
 Its the empanada guy.
 It has been a long, lonely winter.
 It is real, thank you for saying that.
 Me?
 Yeah, um... I cant believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, Ill go put on my cup.
 Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Lets try it.
 That may have been my fault.
 Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, youre not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. â€œIts all about the groin.â€
 I dont think thats very common.
 Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
 Its interesting that youre drawn to the point of view of the attacker. Â You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel...  written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
 All right, well, lets try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesnt everyone stand? Okay, so... youre being attacked. Youve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
 Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that youre alive.
 Theres no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
 Okay, this isnt over. Lets stay focused, okay? Â We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
 Okay. Good point...
 I dont... I dont...
 I dont know if this is gonna help...Uh...
 We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
 Okay, this is whats called pre-violent posturing.
 Okay, Im at whats called â€œthe decision point.â€
  Knock, knock. Hey, Sashas first year in the troops, so Im selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
 What?
 You cant claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Cant you sell at your church or barber shop?  Or chess club, or?
 Thats it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
  Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
 No, no, no. Its not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
 See?
 No, you hit the road, jack.
 You know, why dont we split the order? Its only fair.
 Im, Im not gonna comment on my personal life.
 No.
 50?
  And this is Sam.
 Yeah, I dont know why you picked names that are also guys names.
 Dont make me be your pony, Kevin.
 Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another mans horsey.
 Robert did say youd be joining us. Welcome. Im Tony.
 I- I said Im Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, Im Toby.
 It happens, okay? Uh, so lets just find an empty desk for you, and uh, Im sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
 Erin, HR is a joke. I cant do anything about anything.
 Me?
 Now, were actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
 I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesnt back down from anybody. And he calls people â€œKimosabeâ€.
 Thats true. Theres no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
 No.
 Ive seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
 Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that.
 Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
 I can refer you to someone to talk to.
 Give you a name or-
 Hey, Andy, Nobodys calling you crazy, Andy. Were your friends, Andy.
 Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
