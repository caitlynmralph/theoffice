 OK I think Oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that.
 No not really...
 Apparently you called Oscar "faggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
 All right Michael, but Oscars really gay.
 I mean for real.
 No, I mean hes attracted to other men.
 OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
 OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
 All right, now Oscars feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, thats your fault.
 What?
 Really? Shes dating?
 Hey, Pam.
 Its, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
 Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. Its so weird.
 Okay.
 Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but deaths just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
 What?
 It was obvious...
 Second?
 Actually, shes right. This isnt appropriate. Why dont I take these.
 Yes.
 Michael, uh... we shouldnt be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
 Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
 Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When Im 65.
 Hey.
 Ah, pretty good. I finished.
 About seven.
 Well, that has wheels.
 Hey, this came with the Stamford book.  Can you take care of it?
 Hey, Jim!
 Oh, really good.
 How are you? Hey. Welcome back.
 No, Im sorry, its...
 No, its nothing. Well just...
 So... okay.
 All right... sorry... sorry about that.
 It was just...
 Nothing.
 Um... You might want these orientation materials.
 I dont... I dont think we can do that.
  This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
 Michael. Whys everyone locked in the conference room?
 Well, youre going to have to let em out. Or... or I will.
 You know theyre teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. Theyre teasing you. To be funny.
 Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
 Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
 Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
 Its a dead animal in an office. You cant...
 Im sorry.
 Clean it in your car.
 Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe-  Why?
 Hey Kev.
 Hey I need to talk to you right now.
 About you and Jan.
 Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, youve entered into an intimate relationship.
 Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we dont talk now.
 You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
 All right, if youre having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
 All right, thanks Michael.
 At the gym.
 Toby! Yeah!
 The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
 Oh, this looks great. Id, Id love to be there, but my daughters play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
 Well, its important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
 Here.
 I was...
  Yes.
 Im... here, Jan.
 Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim wont press charges against Roy or the company.
 Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
 Which is where?
 Thanks Dwight.
 Can you stop...
 Theres a bunch of people back here, maybe...
 Guys...
 I dont think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
 Where?
 Alright.
 No.
 How would we get home?
 Hi, Jan.
 Just preparing for the deposition.
 This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
 Sure.
 Ok, um, one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  Its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
 Um, yeah.  Youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, its also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
 No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
 Well, thatll work.
 You know, anything that warms you.
 Sedentary.
  Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
 Nice.
 Hey, whats going on? Theres a police car in the...
 Whats going on?
 I dont think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
 I dont think the women in this office -
 I was at a parent-teacher conference.
 Hey, uh... whered you decide to take Karen tonight?
 I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
 Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
 Its Beach Day...
 Hey, want my sun screen?
 Uh-huh.
