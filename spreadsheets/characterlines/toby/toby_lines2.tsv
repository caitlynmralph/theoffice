 Michael?
 Um... I need to talk to you in your office. Itll just take two seconds.
 The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
 Its really not a big deal, Michael.
 And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
 Just to refresh you... .
 on our policy.
 Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
 Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so Ill go over that later.
 So remember, intent is irrelevant. And thats it. Pam?
 Great point.
 Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, lets just act everyday like Pams Moms coming in. All right. Thats it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
 Uh, yes!
 I can go over it with you.
 Its over.
 Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So lets just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
 Ok, you know, Michael...
 No.
 Well, that would be...
 Okay, Im lost.
  Hey Dwight.
 Sure.
 Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... Im just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
 Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
 I should get back to work.
  He talked the whole time.
 Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is Becker now.
 You dont need to write ex.
 Michael...
 Any word on those time cards?
 We want to go home.
 That is unbelievable.
 Arent the suggestions meant for you?
 I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
 Well, its for Angela, so ..
 Were really not supposed to serve alcohol.
 Wow, you just dive right into it.
 What, what happened?
 What do you need?
 I dont think Pams gonna want to come into the mens room.
 Ryan, is, uh, dead.
 Dead.
 No.  Cant, cant you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
 You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
 Im not processing this.
 He seems fine to me.
 Thats no burst pipe.
 Been to Amsterdam.
  To Amsterdam.
 Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
 Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh cant...
  Come on.
  Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
 Alright, I wasnt expecting that. Lets uh... lets go draw.
 I think these belong to you.
 Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesnt need your watch.
 Is everything okay?
 Uh... its true...
 Mmhmm.
 Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
 Not Jan.
 If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
 Somehow.
 Yes.
 Didnt you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
 Who brought in donuts?
 Happy birthday!
 I... guess I forgot.
 Are you serious?
  Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancees plan? Our health plan is s... just... its terrible.
 I dont really think people are in the laughing mood.
 I work here.
 Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
 Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
 No its not. Its a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
 You cant do that.
 Thats not random.
 Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographers back there today.
 Its just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
 Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
 Heres how I usually handle this all I do is listen.
 These things just have a way of working themselves out.
 Its like if you write someone a letter, when youre really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
 Okay.
 That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
 You solved it?
 Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out.
 Mmm-Hm.
 I... I cant do that.
 That...
  Its all Dwights.
 Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that Im sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
 Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year.
 Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
 To your HR representative.
 Fine, Ill take your name off.  So no one will know.
 Sure.
  Just take it.
 Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
 Actually, I didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its... You know, theres gambling and alcohol, and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
 Ill call.
 I have good cards.
 I dont really play cards, but Im not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
