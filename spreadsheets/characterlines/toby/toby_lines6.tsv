   He has a doctors note.
   A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
   Thats not a very good Darryl.
   Hmmm.
   Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didnt reach the top shelf.  I dont know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.   Ill punch you in da mush, see.
    Sounds like a EMDP-40.
   Youre into trains?
   Wow.
   Thats so cool.
   Wow, Id love to take a look at that.
   Well, you know, cause of  the trains.
   Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.

   I cant believe this.  Hey you, ass****!
   You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
   Just keep going.
   If they were dilated...
   No, nah.  I dont see it.
   Hey Darryl, look ahhh, were here to apologize ahh...
   What?
   Well, I dont think theres any reason to check em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
   You really did it...
   Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
   So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
 Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
  What?
||
  Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.
 Well the "fun" is in it.

 What did I do?
  Yeah, sure, whats up?
  Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
  Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
  Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
  Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
  Yeah... thats why they pay me the big bucks.
  Im good...
  You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, wed become friends.
   Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
  Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything thats happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
  Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
    Buddy, I think that...
 Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
  I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure its off company property, right?
  Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
  Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and theres a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.   Pow!
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
 You cant,  Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
 No!
  Wow! Cause...
 Thank you!

 Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
 Oop.
 Looks like we kicked it.

 Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
  I dont think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
 I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he cant dock your pay. Thats not legal.
 Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
  This here is a radon test kit.  Okay I will be putting em everywhere. And... please dont throw these out.  This is a radon test kit.  Please dont throw these out.  See them all over the office.
