  America is one big mall.
  The glasses are a little...
  Yeah, I liked them too.
 But if he doesnt?
 I-I dont think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
 Okay. Stark Industries isnt real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
  Will do.  Wont do.
  Its really good. Its a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
 No.
 Hey, man, can I get a plus five? Its all guys.
 Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. Thats a good line.
 Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
 Shake things up. Im a Nader guy.
 Hope you brought your pipes. Were about to smoke the opium of the masses.
 Ive heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
 For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
 Hello.
  Teach for America girls are way hotter, but theyre nuts.
 Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
  Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970s. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
 What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
 Were behind.
 Hows It Going?
 Hey, Im WUPHF.
 Whats up Facebook?
 You shouldve sent me a WUPHF.
  When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time.
  Thanks Erin.
 I love it.
 Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
 We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
 New Investors are key, though. Thats actually why I came in today.
  Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who havent invested yet.
 Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
 Awesome.
 Hows everybody doing?!
 Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if Im describing you.
 For my current investors, things are going great.
 Washington University. I dont even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
 So Ive decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
 No, no--Oscar, its not--its not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
 Fun, communication, connection.
 Well, its tight, as with any start-up.
 We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep em coming.
  Check this out.
 Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
 A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, its all over.
 Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. Ill be right back.
 WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that youre at spring break, Daytona Beach.
 Everyones like, "Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?" Or, Uh, "Hey, whats up with that helicopter? Its Ry from WUPHF!"
 "Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"
 "Whats he dropping?! Wow, whats falling on us, man?!" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
 The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually dont think about the money. Ever.
 Baby, Baby, Baby--
 No, no, no, no, no.
 I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
  I got this, its okay. Dont worry about this.
 The Washington University Public Health Fund.
 The domain name. Yeah, they do.
 Have some faith in this idea!
 Yes. You alone do, actually.
 Michael, hows it going, bro?
 Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
 I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
 Look, I know Ive tapped you so hard.
  Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people dont give you enough credit.
 Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there dont seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
 Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
 Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
 We totally should.
 I gotta work on this.
 Yeah.
 Im betting on myself.
 Hey. Its an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them theyre wrong?
 Oh... Uh, Thats a lot of pressure. I--Im gonna need some more time.
 Okay. I wont let you down.
 Im on it Jim. Im on it.
 Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
 Actually, it was.
 Where is Tibet?
 When was China founded?
 Who is Mao?
 Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
 Hes rubbing his neck. Hes rubbing his neck!
 Hes rubbing his neck.
 Theres no connection between the origin story and the quest.
 We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, its the bears quest.
 Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
 Well, it sounds like you know what you want.  Its also a little derivative of a serias called Bear Man. Did you look that up?
 Okay.
  Its amazing. Its so great. Thank you.
 Hey, whos in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
 An F train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
 Okay, well, Ill just stick with my mojito.
 The other way.
 I just feel blocked. Like Im living, but Im not...
 Yeah.
 Thats real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
 Okay, no.
 No, shes lying.
 In you go.
 Yup.
 And?
 Okay. I dont... I dont like committing to things just like that.
 No, I dont like committing to not doing things, either. Thats just as big a commitment.
 Yes.
 Yes, Ill do it.
 And if I flake, I flake.
 Just so you know, its totally amicable. Were fine. We dont need people here to take sides.
 Its not irrelevant. Details
 We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
 No, with the messed up laws in this country, I dont want to be married until everyone can be married.
 No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
 Ok fine, you know what, this actually isnt amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
 Speaking of, Gabe, I dont see Erin at this meeting.
 Hey. Youre looking for me?
 No you werent.
 You wanted to have sex in my office.
 No. Its... its cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when youre finished. Ill be out here.
 Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
 You should enter it in festivals!
 Right this isnt the U.S. Government.
  Everything... Everything.
  Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve.
  Sometimes you over react.
 Free sample?
 My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her Mom you should sell this, youd make a fortune and she always says No its just for family. Well finally I was like f*** it, Ill sell it so Im like Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends and shes like uh, ok ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. Its so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
 No I meant like uh, its cool, its kosher, its all good.
 Thank you. Whatcha got there?
 My mom also makes the best salsa.
 Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
 Nice.
 Cant really tell the...
 Will you marry me Holly?
  That is so badass. So hardcore.
||
 I love when people say like crack when theyve obviously never done crack.
 I dont know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
 Yeah thats great.
 Why dont you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
 How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, Im very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? Its, its so subjective.
 You helped me get off drugs!
 Wow.
 This is... totally unnecessary.
 No.
 Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
 The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that its impossible to put into words what youre bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that Im Kellys supervisor.  Its not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
 Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry...
 Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  Ill tell you what I would have done for you.  Id lie for you.
 Id die for you too.
  Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I dont have those call logs on my desk, were just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
   Youre the best.  Thank you.
  So I am the new customer service supervisor.
 And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
 All the time.
 Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
 Hey!  Kelly, thats the last time Im gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if youre only here for the money, maybe you shouldnt be here at all.
 Oh, thats hilarious, Kelly.
 I did not see Rango.
  Oh, close call!  Okay, why dont you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
 I felt terrorized.
 Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
  You guys, um, talking Senator?
  Cause hes totally gay?
  Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 oclock in the morning.
   Oh no, Stanley... youll live forever...
  Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James.
  I want an outsider.
  No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesnt see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
  No, youre right, Pam, lets just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
  Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
  I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasnt good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But dont just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when Im in the mood... to be led.
  Take care, man.
