 You staying?
 What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I dont know what Im going to do. Thats the least of my...concerns right now.
 You a big William Hung fan?
 I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
 What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
 Im just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
 I did.
 I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
 The temp agency wants to know what you think.
 Ah, well, Im interested in business.
 Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
 Fozzie bear?
 Got it.
 Yeah.
 Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
 Uh, okay, two?
 Okay... uh, sorry?
 No.
 ...I dont.
 I dont want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I dont want to have a thing... here. You know, I dont want to be the "something guy".
 Yeah.
  Dont...
 Thats actually a test prep book.
 Thats a test prep for business school.
 I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
 Yeah.
 No, not yet.
 Just started.
 I... wouldnt even know where to start.
 All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
 Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
 It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
 I am.
 I am.
 Its a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
 Maybe we should get some air.
 Im really uncomfortable.
  Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
 Whats your number?
 Um...
 You got to... you got to give it to me again.
 Now I have it.
 I am so sorry.
 I cant believe I started the fire.
 Im really sorry, Dwight.
 What?
 No.
 Im really sorry, Dwight.
 Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
 Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
 Why is that secret?
 Updating emergency contacts.
 Catch-22.
 Whats her address?
 Hello?
 Do you mean Neverland?
 What?
 Who is your emergency contact?
||
 Hello?
 Is your wife still your contact?
 Kay.
 Fudge?
 Ok, to what?
 I have the emergency contacts.
 Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
 Yeah, alright, Ill um, see you Monday.
  Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  Ive got Michaels lucky tie.
 Good.
 Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
 Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
 Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
 I forget it, brutha.
 Dont you mean constructive criticism?
 Hey, is Katy coming?
 Huh, is it ok if I call her?
 Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
  Whoa, a video iPod.
 Wasnt there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
 Yeah, you left the price tag on.
 Yeah.
 And I have to give it to her? I dont have a choice?
 Yeah, I figured.
 Hey.
 Ryan Howard.
 What line of work you in, Bob?
 Were running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
 Oh, no.
 I really did not do anything.
  Whose butt is that?
 Oh, how did I not guess that?
 I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
 Im already in business school.
 Here you go.
 Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
 They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
 Yes.
 They had no yams.
 You know, around age twelve, I just started goin for it.
 Twice.
 I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
 You are very welcome.
 No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
 You sure?
 Ok.
 I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michaels pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
 Whats that?
 Huh?
 Yeah, I think I can handle it.
 I think.
 If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And Id forget too.
 Creed did you organize the menu book?
 No, that was mandatory.
  What?
  What?
 Jims been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but its nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
  It wasnt me.  Um... it wasnt me.  It was not me.
 Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
 Thats what I told him.  Thanks.
 Whats up?
 What?
 I dont know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ...  Umm... Shes really cool.
 Yeah, totally.
 Did she say something?
 Do you know if shes looking for a long-term thing or if shed be cool just hangin out?
 Can you find out?
 How about rainbows?
 You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
  I hooked up with her on February 13th.
 Soda.
 I cant tonight. I have plans with my friends.
 Cool. Cool. OK.
 Yeah.
 Youre inviting Jim?
 Actually, I dont see myself ever getting married.
 I know what I said.
 You really think youre going to go?
 Nice. Send me a postcard.
 Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I dont know. If I were a betting man, Id say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
 Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, Im learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
 Wow.
 No.
 Uhm...
 Yes, I--
 Okay.
 Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
 Right. Okay.
 Um, Im already getting the pizzas from Bernettis, so...
 No! I will... go.
 Who uses calling cards anymore?
  Someone ate three feet of that thing?
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
 I go to a lot of parties.
 I am not giving you my keys.
 Whats the hard way?
 Yeah, lets do it that way.
 I dont think Michaels ever done drugs. I dont know if anyone has ever offered him any.
 Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
 Yeah.  Maybe.
 Thank you.
 Um, I dont...
 Um...  lets um, lets keep our clothes.
 My voicemails really spotty... sometimes...
 One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
