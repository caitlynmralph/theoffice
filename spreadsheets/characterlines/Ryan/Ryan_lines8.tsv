 Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesnt the fact that Im in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
 Its all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. Hes a genius. You guys just dont get him.
 Heres the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
 Its called owling. Youll read about it in like eight months.
 Profound man, your husband.
 How much memory does it have without the booster?
 Im sorry,â€ Lâ€?
 I like it, I like it!
 T-Dog?
 SoHos mostly lofts but OK.
 Nice. Right back where I like you.  Can you make ten copies of this for me?
 Why not? What are you doing?
 Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
 OK, (well just dismiss it.)??????
 Id give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they cant cure AIDS with 25%, the extra tens not gonna make a difference. At some point, youre just throwing good money after bad.
 Just give us the address. Well look it up online.
 Whats the dress code on this?
 This is not funny, man, let me down.
 Its not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
 Id like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
 Thats because you didnt bring a jacket.
 Yeah! Im too hot anyway.
 Cant wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployments at 9%. I wouldnt miss it for the world.
  If you get into season 1, you can really...
 Whoopi Goldberg.
 Oh my god!
 We cant do this Dwight.
 Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something likez64$8.  Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
 Oh!  We still have our jobs.
 Hey â€“ asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
 Yeah me too.
 So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
 Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
 Hey, whos this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
 Yeah, cause his moms cars probably not a Nissan Z.
 Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
 Whats the halal option?
 Out.
 Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and Im not even a sheep. Im on the freaking moon.
 May I go first?
 Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we cant get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is whats for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, thats right, Japan. Dont you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. Its the sushi of paper.
 Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
 Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
 Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
  Its really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
 You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea.  That is 100 percent your idea.
 Thats why my foundation â€“ The Dream for a Wish Foundation â€“ is going to put them out of business. Theyre not going to know what hit them.
 Actually Ryan.
 Bitttch!
 Yes!
 Will do.
 Whoo!
 But look, its Christmas, so youre allowed... whoa, hello. Um, youre allowed to do...
 You cant click on these Kardashian links, thats why you have so many viruses.
 Im trying but you need to-
 Id be satisfied with eight.
 Nine?
 Oh, neat.
 Oh, great.
 That doesnt sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
 Yeah?
 Okay, Im turning it off.
 I wont look at it.
 I cant- I cant not touch it.
 Look, I cant, I cant not have my phone. Im sorry. I want to be with my phone.
 Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
 Robert, you are too kind.
 With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
 To both these bears.
 I mean, its clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
 To madness.
 Robert, I want you to know, Im here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
 Hey, hes asleep. We can just leave.
 Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
 I get that.
 Eh, a little bit.
 Why am I shorter than the table that Im standing next to?
 What are the criteria for going?
 Stop calling us â€œguysâ€.
 Stop. Stop it Andy.
 You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. Thats myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
 Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. Thats what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
 But...
 No no, I want to go.
 You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
 It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is How do we make this a better party?
 Right. Think different, from Apple.
 Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized Im not going to need it down there.
 No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
 Hey, you. Im so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the waters fine.  Oh, not cool!
 Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Dont see too many museums around here."
 So whos leading this thing, anyway?
 I cant wait to meet him.
 I-
 Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
 Dwight?
 Oh! Who called it? Nothin but net.
 I can field this one.
 Ill have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
 A waffle?
 No.
 Oh, no, I didnt know.
 You come with me. Were gonna get you that waffle.
 Why would Erin confide in me that shes staying here in Florida if she didnt want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
 Yeah, they keep them on cause its less expensive than turning them on and off.
 Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
 Hello, what do we have here?
 Right.
 Got that.  Get down.
  Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Hey, this is fun.
 I know. Can I give you a compliment? Im really impressed by how much youve grown. Since I met you, its like night and day.
 Yeah?
 Really?
 Yeah.
  Six months? um, okay, Im in love with Kelly.
 Are you holding this chair?
 â€˜cause I feel like Im gonna fall off.
 Im not wearing the right shoes for this.
 When people see this presentation, theyre gonna  in their pants.
 Sabre. Its time to come home.
 Yeah, no , Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
 You know what?
 God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
 Youre so ignorant. You barely know what youre talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
 On my God. Youre so embarrassing. Â My mom would say the best stuff, though.
 And you know that Im capable of this.
 What did you think of the presentation?
 Oh! â€œFixâ€ means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
 No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
  Hey Uncle Lucas, its your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so its different because its your wife? Â Well, that doesnt make any sense to me.
 Dont talk to me right now. Im sorry. I- I know youre my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I dont understand is...
 Thought you checker my Tumblr?
 Well, I updated it.
 How long do you think its been up there, Kevin?
 Hey, thats not a code name. Thats just an insult.
 Yeah!
 Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
 Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
 Dont shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated cause the babys crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you cant do that.
 Yeah.
 Oh, my God.
 Me too.
 Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if youre into Indian people. Im not.
 Hey, um, whats the deal with this guy? Hes really into Kelly, huh?
 Maybe we werent right together, but... its weird. Id rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
 I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
 Yeah, the fractional ownership property.  Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
 You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
 Im in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I dont know how Im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
 Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
 Well thats your opinion and its her opinion, but its not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
 Well a lot of people would say that Im a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
 For Kelly?
 Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I cant even read it. My heart couldnt handle it.
 No. It would cause me too much pain.
 This poem would crush you!
 You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
 You are toxic! You are toxic!
 Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please dont interrupt.
 Well you do a lot, so just dont. Thank you. I know that I havent always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
 What is your problem?  Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
 Can we turn this -ing thing around? Thank you.
 Thank you. Kelly, I cant promise you that well always stay together. I cant promise you that Ill never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages arent built that way. Men arent built that way. Theres a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that well break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
 Will you roll those dice with me?
 No you dont.
 No you dont.
 What?
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
 Smokeys dead.
 Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess Im the first to know.
 Oh you liked him? Thats nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? Im glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
 Huh?
 Oh God, Nellie! What wasnt his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"?
 Um... God, so many, Nellie!
 Okay, Im not... Im not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
 Okay, Im sorry Im not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
 Thats... Thats not the point!
 Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
 Okay well, thats a relief!
 Yeah... Whos opening?
 Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I dont think I can see this.
 How much is parking, like 30 bucks? Thats not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
 Dont call me a clown, Pam. Youre better than that!
 Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
