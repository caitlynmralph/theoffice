 Dont vaccinate it.
   Hey.
   Yeah, I might stop by.
   Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
   Yes, Im coming to your wedding.
   Probably, yes.
 You know, its a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
 Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
 Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
 Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
 Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
  I was the youngest VP in the company history.
 Um... also--
  Where were you guys?  Do you know how long Ive been waiting here?
 Then do it.
 Write a book.
 Well first of all, there is no such thing as The Mafia.
 What you have are specific families. Whats the guys last name?
  Whoa, thats my mother youre talking about...
  Ahh, I dont think so, no...
  Id rather not say.
   ...it should go with the persona you already have.
  Twenty.
  Deal.
  This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
  Id rather not say.
 Thats really not the trend in vampires right now.
  Ive always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
  Well heres what Ive been doing around here.   Its for a series on exposure in the workplace.
 Hey.
  Quick question.
 Are you scared?
  We heard about the punch.
  Im getting concerned that you dont seem to understand whats going to happen.  Do you?
  alright.  See you there.
  You dont have to keep saying "I do declare".  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
 Ill use it when youre done.
 Uh, it doesnt seem like theres much of a point if the companys going under.
 The companys probably going under, though.
 Seems like its leaning one way.
 Definitely.
 So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
 Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
  Heres the thing. Um, Ive tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, Im such a perfectionist...
 That Id kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
 Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
 What?
 Great.
 Yep, that is a problem.
 Well, Im glad youre finally being proactive, Jim.
 Mmm-hmm.
 I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
 Uh, Im very sorry... about everything.
  Is there internet?
 Hows it going?  Good day?
 Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
 I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
 I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
 Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
 Ugh.
 Whoa, whoa.
 Im doing something over here.
 What are you talking about?
 No no no.
 Yeah! That was the idea.
 Awesome!
 Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
  Um, I was at another dumpster!
 Did you see Saw?
 No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
 Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
 Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
 Yes!
 We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we dont kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
 Well suggest something else then! Dont just...
 Dont just criticize my idea!
 You think of something then!
 Nick.
 Like Frodo!
 Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
 Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
 Threatening you? No.
 Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
 I would love to.  Why not?
 Well, Im sorry that I dont want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
 I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
    "You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."
  Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
 Because its St. Patricks Day, people go out in groups.
 Why are you being so weird about this?
 Why no kids?
 Its my -
 No its - how would he even know the Kardashians?
 No, Stanley, do you -
Guys, one second.
One second.
Guys, guys, guys, please.  Ok, all right, its all yours now.
If we save em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
 Thats a little derivative.
 Uh, its not organic. Do you know what I mean?
 Okay...
 Tell her everyone in home room thinks shes fat.
 Its easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think youre treated differently because of your race?
 And then the two of us are cleanin house.
 Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! Its in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
 Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
 Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
 Sorry, dude.
  Is there a curtain rod in the room?
  Okay.
  I dont know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
  All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology."
  Im not scream-- Im not screaming.
  Good for you, man. Good for you.
  He takes what he wants.
  You know what? I think youre attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
  You read my mind.
  Yep.
  Its hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I dont know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I cant be that cold.
