 Yeah, Im not a temp anymore.  I got Jims uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
 All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
 Uh, fun jeans.
 I dont want ketchup.
 Uh, no thanks, Im good.
 Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
 Thank you.
   Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
 Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
 When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking "Im a little too old for this."  And I was
 A dime and a nickel.
 But the other one is. Ive heard that before.
 Because hes my son. The doctor is the boys mother.
 He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
 Its a polar bear because youre at the North Pole.
 Yeah.
 Yes. Im very excited.
 I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwights the top salesman in the company and hes taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, Im excited.
 So what if theyre not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So wheres the sales office?
 I know where were not.
 I dont think you know what youre saying.
 Uh huh.
 Gotcha.
 Ok.  Of course.
 Hey Dwight, youre a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. Ill make you the ole commodor.  Ill abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, Ill really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
 Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what youre doing. I get it.
 Yeah.
 Who was that?
 Is that your Cousin Mose?
 Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
 Depression?
 Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
 No. Ok. All right. All right. Its over. This is over.  OK.
 No, youre a freak. Im not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
 Look, that, thats not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
 Wait, can you go back?
 Ok, Im going to establish time frames.
 Im going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".
 Im going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
 Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
 Im going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
 They really didnt like me.
 I dont get it. I dont get what I did wrong.
 You drive.
 I think about that all the time.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So, youre Kellys sisters, huh?
 What?
 They said something about Zach Braff.
 No, you dont...
 Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
 Yes.
 Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
 It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
  I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but Im gonna go someplace else and youre gonna go someplace else. It just doesnt make sense.
 This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michaels gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think its for the best.
 Is Jim coming back.
 I just dont want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
 Oh, yeah, totally.
 Uh yeah, well meet you there.
 Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
 Im good! How are you? So...
 Yeah.
 Um... unless you really, really want it back.
 Cool, thank you.
 Yuh.
 Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. Thats why I got the desk.
 Im sorry. Its just, its a little distracting.
 Sometimes he brings more costumes.
 They have business classes there?
 Prison sounds great.
 Michael, please.
 Ah man, I cant.
 Im not feeling so well. Ive got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.
 Thanks.
 Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
 I miss the days when there was only one party I didnt want to go to.
 Looks like they forgot the power cord.
 No.
 Huh?
 I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass."
 Is there a prize?
 Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
 Yeah, if you dont mind.
 Hi.
 Um...  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
 Oh...
 Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
 What?
 Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
 Yeah, me too.
 He hasnt even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
 Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
 Oh gross.
 Kelly dont do this.
 You know what youre doing.
 Ok.
 You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
 If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... Id be stupid
 What?
 Y-You understand nobodys graduating.
 ...It doesnt apply.
 Quit it!
 ...Dunder-Mifflin cant compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
 And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
 Michael.
 What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
 ...It wasnt personal.
 Pack my--?
 Look, Im sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you dont have to fire me.
 To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
 Its only temporary, okay? Dont get excited.
 I think I heard it on Roys side.
  Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
 Yeah, close one.
 I cant imagine what I would have done.
 Well that was funny, thats why.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 You know what?  I didnt---
 Well, dont talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
 I dont know what youre talking about.
 No, I said your idea was stupid.
 Dont you see why thats insane?
 What about a long sleeve T?
 Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
 Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
 At least were outside.
 F and C, doubletime?
 Ill go.
  Yeah.
 Whats the occasion?
 Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
 Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
 I figured. Its cool. I dont - I wouldnt want to be in an office relationship anyway.
 Can you just stop this right now, or Im not gonna do this anymore.
 You have to stop yelling at me or Im not gonna do the egg race.
 Thats what being a good captain is about. Its about listening to the members of your team.
 Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creeds brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. Ive read some of it. Even for the intranet its... pretty shocking.
 I dont do that stuff anymore.
  Im excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
  Nobody.  You and I are done.
