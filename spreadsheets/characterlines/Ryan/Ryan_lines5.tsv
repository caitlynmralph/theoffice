   Hows my favorite branch doing?  All right .
  And you got a goatee!
  Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
  Hey Kevin...  Thats really funny.
  Its great to see you Kev.
  Im keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when Im back on top, theyll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
  Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that Ive quit the rat race Ive realized theres so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the companys history.  Ive even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
  I dont need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
  All right.
||
  Kelly.
  I wanted to say Im sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know Ive changed.
  We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
  That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe Ill see you around.
  Yeah.
||
  I did.
||
   Everything.  Shes perfect.
  Oh...
 Ok, elephant in the room.  Lets talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and Ill give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
  Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
 Two HR reps.
 I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
 Gordon Gekko.
 ... Yeah.
 Morning.  Wow. Good morning Dwight.
 All right.
 Living in the moment.
 I dont play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost.  Can I tell you what else I learned?
 What?
 Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
 Her Americas Got Talent finale party over the summer.  Thats crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
  Just checking out where Im going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
  This looks like where Ill probably do my pushups every day.
 Yeah... Mmmmm...
 This has to happen again. Darryl cant happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
 Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press "send".
 Has to be done. Well press send together.
 Id like to see him try.
 Thats all he wrote?
 Can I see it?
 Didnt you two date for like a long time?
 Were back.
 I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldnt do better than kelly.
  Yeah.
 Youre taking two?
  You did that for me?
 Are you happy you did?
   Whats up?
 Yeah, yeah Ill see them.
 Yeah, punch him.
  You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
 Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; Im totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
 I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
 Yeah, its crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someones gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
 Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
 I--- I would find a way.
 I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
  I cant do this.
 Its not fair to you.  And its really not fair to me.
 That was your choice; dont put that on me.  Im just going on a little trip.
 Its not that kind of trip.  Im going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I dont do it now Ill never get to go.  And Ill always resent you for it... you dont want me to resent you, do you?
 Lets be adults about this.  Lets have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
 Im swamped, Michael.  Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
 Hey, you.
 Sixty thousand dollars a year.
 What do you make, secretary?
 I told you guys, Im really busy here, so...
 What size shoes are you guys?
 What are those, a mens ten?
 Where is it?
 Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
 It was indescribable.
 Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
 You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, well hang out Scranton style.
 Please dont listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, shes like um, shed probably be a Six in New York, but shes like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. Its a small space.
 Pams better at that stuff
 How is it insulting to say that youre good at something?
 Im not judging it, its like ... I could run GM but I couldnt fix a car. Its not  saying one is better than the other.
 What the hell?
 Yeah I make originals too.
 Yeah!
 Thats me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
 You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
 This is from the sun.
 No dont take that, give that back!
 Im gonna make a spreadsheet.
 Yeah!
 Go make a copy, secretary.
 Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
 Rock the house!
 Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there.  I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one Im talking about its the one, the one with the awesome browser.  No, not that one.
 Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I dont want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
 Are we staying til five?
 Im texting. I dont want to get my fingers sticky.
 Keep going.
 Write it down.
 Oh!
 We did it !
 I can get there.
 Oh, awesome.
 Yeah.
 Finally.
 Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
 We can spend a couple days there.
 Weve been making 500 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since Ive gotten clean theres something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
 Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
 Most dorm rooms dont even have that.
 Lets see what a delivery guy costs.
 Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
 Yeah.
 Explain what you think that is.
 I never went to Thailand.
 I went to Fort Lauderdale.
 Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
  Youve never had Pad Thai.
 Oh, thats nice.
 Hes bluffing, Pam.
 Maybe.
 Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that were broke.
 That were having any problem at all.
 No, man.  Youre-- youre fine.
 Just put it out of your mind.
 Michael, you  havent even heard--
 Well have to talk about this.
 How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
 I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
 Yeah, discuss these things--
 Yes, yes, yes!
  Who is it?
 Oh, thanks, man.
 You look so classy in that picture.
 Tough.
 You.  Us.
  Its gotta be because they all want their clients.
 What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
 Chiklis style.
 Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
  That looks great.
 I can eat.
 Im sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
 Exactly.
 Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
  Things have been generally good.
 Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
 At these prices with this service...
 Youre not gonna find this anywhere else.
 No, no, no.  Sir, dont listen.
 Stop flustering me, everybody!
 Okay.
 Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now theres not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
  I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
 If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
 Thanks.
 I dont do lunch. Im eating five small meals a day now.
 Now that Im back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
