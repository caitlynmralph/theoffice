 Yes Michael?
 Back? Why is that Michael?
 Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
 Did this happen on company property?
 I dont think you understand how jeopardy works.
||
 People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I dont even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... its a weird word.
   for the cure...  leave a message" Ryan hangs up]
 Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! Its great to see you. Is Michael in?
 OK. Should we get started?
 Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
 Stop that! Stop that!
  You scared me.
 Michael and everybody, umm...
 ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. Id like your respect. I am your boss now. Youre gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
 So...
 OK...
 Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
 Perfect.
 Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
 This is a massive overhaul. Were getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
 Ill stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
 This is company-wide, Dwight.
 Andy.
 Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor.
 Thank you everybody.
 As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
 OK, whats up?
 Well it is business, but not as usual.
 No.  Were throwing out the entire playbook, were starting from scratch, were implementing a brand new system.
 No. Were not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
 So, how are you?
 Good.
 Kelly...
 Kelly, Im your boss now, OK? You cant keep talking to me like Im your boyfriend.
 I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
 OK. OK.
 I can... I cant talk about this right now, OK? After work, well go out to dinner, well talk about it then, OK?
 Jan.
 So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
 Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
 Well... you look great.
 Scranton suits you.
 You were let go.
 Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
  Ohh... man.
 Michael.
 Were not doing this today.
 OK. This is...
 Michael,  can I talk to you a second?
 We have actual work to do.
 Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
 Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
 Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go?
 Kelly, come on.
 You dont?
 You lied about being pregnant.
 You really dont understand why that might make me kind of angry?
 Were never getting back together.
 Whats, uh, going on here?
 With gift baskets.
 Good luck Michael.
  Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand thats confusing.
 Next night, Im out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure Ill get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night.  I run into Vince Vaughn.
 Literally.
 ... Later guys.
 Hey Pam. I havent settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know youre into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
 Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and Ill take a look?
 Thank you very much.
 Cool.
 I like it a lot. Its clear and subtle at the same time. Its really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
 Id love to talk to you about it more.
 Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
 Wear something nice.
 What?
 I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
 Youre kidding?
 Thats... great, I... thats awesome.
  So let me um, let me look at these.
 Cool.
 That is not correct.
 Im not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldnt be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
 Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! Its great to see you. Is Michael in?

 Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.

 You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
 No.  You dont know until you live there.  Theres something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
 No. You cant imagine it, though.  The energy when youre actually there.  Youre just part of something bigger than you, thats moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
 No.  It... eh... you cant... its not about how it sounds.
  Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I dont want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
  Convergence.  Viral marketing.  Were going guerrilla.  Were takin it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I dont want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin paper just became fun.
 And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
 Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
 Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
 Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that hes being held against his...
||
  I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
 I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
 Hold on, Ill get them on the phone.
 Hey guys! Whats happening? Hows my favorite branch doin?
 Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
 Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
 Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
 You didnt prepare a presentation at all, did you?
 Im your boss.
 You have another job?
 You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
 It did, all ready.
 Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
 Its not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isnt information you need.
 How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
 You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
 What?
 No, its whomever.
 Do you really know which one is correct?
 As an object.
 Wait! This doesnt matter. And I dont even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or youre fired here.
 Hello?
 What?
 I told you not to call about small problems.
 Thats good. Theyre creative, youre not.
 Its not part of your job, its like, maybe you can cook but it doesnt mean you should start a restaurant.
 Okay, Im not really interested in that right now. Im delegating creativity to creative professionals. Its a different skills set. Look, I wasnt good at sales, right?
 But Im good at managing people who do sales .
 Im on Michael.
 You have to know how to work this. Theres no excuse for this.
 I can get you a tutor if you need-
 Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
 Take the call, friend.
 I insist you take your work calls.
 Hey Michael.
 Im glad youre here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
 Could we talk off the record? As friends?
 Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now youve been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you wont do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
 Good. That is great to hear.
 Yes, Im having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
 My favorite branch. Hows everybody doing?
 Love it. Go.
 I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
 David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
 You did. Yeah.
 Watch your back Jim. Im just kidding.
 Ok thanks Michael.
 Im here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
 Dwight.
 This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
 I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
 TBD. Phyllis?
 Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
 Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
 Its all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? Youre chatting with your friends, youre talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
 Do you have a question Kelly?
 You too.
 Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
 Na.
 Sorry man.
 But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
 Unreal.
 Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
 I dont know man, when you think about it, Cabos really the third world. I dont go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
 Michael.
 What are you doing here?
 That is so awesome man!
 And you brought this guy!
 Aww!
 I know its you guys.
 Im so psyched youre here!
 Woooo!
 Lets get a drink.
 Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
 Ah, he basically is man. Hes a regular banking wizard.
 Bottle service yall?
 Yeah. Hes a normal guy, hes cool.
 Dwight Schrute man. Hows Schrute Farms?
 This guy owns his own beet farm.
 Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I dont even know what that means. What does that mean?
 Crazy. Thats too much for me man, Im gonna hit the bathroom.
 Yeah.
 I dont know, maybe.
 With vodka, youre the best.
 Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
 Hell yeah. Ill hook it up.
  Check again, Ryan Howard.
  Its off. Its not the dude I know. Its some other loser who wont let us in without chicks.
 Lets bail.
 Youre doing it man.
 Hey man, you ever think theres gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed theyll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fares gonna rule the world?
 Its inevitable, right?
 Why wouldnt they let me dance?
 I dont wanna go back in.
 This is a one time thing, you know that right?
 One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
 No.
 No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
 Guys, Im going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
  I think its self-explanatory.  Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
 How do you live with a franchise this bad?
 Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
 Its actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldnt be having this conversation.
 This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
 Woah, dont get all defensive, alright? Its just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
 Congratulations!
 Dont interrupt.
 Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
 All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
 Dont worry about that. Just re-log it.
