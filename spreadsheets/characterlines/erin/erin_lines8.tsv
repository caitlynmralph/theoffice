 Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you dont.Â  And I dont.Â  But I am so excited to be a part of it.
 Here we go.
 Robert California. Lets have a conversation.
 Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
 Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And Ive been doing this thing-
 Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.
 No.
 Andy, dont go in there!
 I like my new group. I liked my old group.
 Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
 Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
 Justine.  She said shes coming by later.
 Would you be requiring a cold beverage while youre here?
 Yes!
 Yeah.
 Hey. Maybe itd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
 What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
 Well I have an idea.
 What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? Youd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwarts.
 Theres a dog in the car.
 As long as you guys dont need me up here.
 I didnt feel anything.
  You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!
 You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
 And we did.
 Jim? Tell them what its called.
 Jim...
 Whys it so far away?
 Yeah.
 Youre doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
 Good...
 Six months.
 Ahh!
 I think we should toast...
  Its either taping or calling.
 Sorry.
 Here you go.
 When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they dont mention one of the best parts. After youre done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
 Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if youre doing something I dont.
 That Andy, so hot and cold. One day hes like, fax these documents, please. The next hes like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erins feeling, right?
 Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
 Thats like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
 Yeah...
 Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I cant deny.
 Oh, I didnt. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
 Hey.
 Novembers sure creeping up, aint it? Cant stop that month!
 Hey, whats the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
 But thats it? Theres nothing about me, or I?
 Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
 Gabe?
 Im throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
 Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didnt stop crying?
 Ok.  Lets say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just more adult more  scary and sexy
 No â€“ just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
 What are you thinking?
 Witchs brew?
 I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
  Thanks.  Its on medium.
 Oh, so we dont have to have that talk.
  Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok.
 Im sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now .  This game is called â€œpecker Pokerâ€.   Its the game of cards that gets you hard.
 All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so
 Sure.
 And shes never called here.  Unless its your mom.
 Two dates? Three dates?
 Wow.  Im so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  Ill see you guys.
 I dont know. Shes from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
 I dont know, Phyllis. Maybe shes from the city.
||
 Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
 Youre a real crumb bum, you know that?
 Dwights car is gone.
 Uh, hes at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
 Do you need a hand?
  Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
 Haho!
 Yeah.
 Whos calling?
 Youre not going to take it?
 Ohohohoh.
 Youre not going to get it though?
 Copy that.
 Andy.
 You have a very important call.
 Are you sure? Its really, really important.
 Really? Because your mother is dead.
 Shes dead. She was hit by a bus.
 This isnt one of those times. Its the police. They said its the worst theyve ever seen.
 Line 2.
 Oh.
 Drive carefully!
 Its right here in PA.
 Im in.
 Cool. Thanks.
  Yeah, but Im confused...
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
 Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I wouldve believed everything he said.
 Interesting.
 No!
 Get out of here!
 Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
 No. Its like two hours and forty-six minutes.
 There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
 Nothing, I just-
 That itll be the first shipment out today.
 Hoo-hoo!
 Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
 Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
 Here you go.
 Well thats a sales desk.
 Thats adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
 He just rolled out and crawled out.
 Um, wheres the shower?
 I love Jessica, and I havent even met her yet. Its like we dont even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
 Oh no, no. Its fine, Kelly.
 Thats OK, I dont want you to do that.
 Jessica. Yes. We dont say hi, we hug.  Im Erin.
 Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
 Wow.
 Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
 Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
 Oh.
 Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
 OK.
 Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
 Hit er up.
 Yeah!
  I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie.  and then I want my nap!
 Whoo!  Thank you.
 Thank you.
 A thousand.
  Maybe you should mind your own business.  Just kidding!
 Hey.
 Game on.
 I would like another alcohol.
 And...
 And you have any advice or anything?
 ...Help me feel better...
 Thank you, goodnight.
  Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
 Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
 What is it?
 I did my part, babe. Im just the bell girl.
 Flying jib.
 Yeah!
  Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, thats so great to hear.
 Im not going to be one of those exes who cant move on. They have their life and I have mine. Im taking an Italian class. So far Ive learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well its not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
 I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
 Oh, I dont know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldnt drive maybe ever.
 How do you know where I live?
 Why?
 Oh. Come on.
 Wow. Andys such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.
  Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
 How is everything? Hows your car?
 Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
 Oh, like a goodbye trip.
 Hi.
 I guess Andy isnt totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldnt survive, and I believe him.
 Hey, Dwight Snoot.
 What you doing?
 Ow.
 Come on, dont you want to play?
 Yeah.
  Oh!
 Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
  Oh Dwight!
  Stop.
 No, you stop.
  Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop.
 No, no, no, hes not looking.
 You can actually stop.
 Andys not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
 What is the most romantic possible thing?
 Dwight, thats just- thats really perfect. Thank you.
 Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
 Dang it! What the heck already?
  Yes! Woo!
 Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
 Hes not looking.  Hey!
 Dwight, weve got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
 One more?
 Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
 Go! Okay. Yeah.
 Ive got this!  Charge! Go! Go!
 Sure. Sure we did.
 Hey, hey, hey Dwight. Its okay. Just rest. Just rest.
 Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
 So I kind of stepped on this. I think its yours.
 The Bernard family seal. Duh.
 Sorry if your special night was ruined.
 Oh, you werent going to do that?
 Andys confused. Thats not what I was hoping for, but its not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
 Oh, Dwight.
 That feels so good!
  Hey, Andy.
 Dwight gives the best back massages.
 I dont know, why dont you check me Dr. Shrute.
 You mean more like dangerous curves...
 Ow!
 You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. Its over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you dont kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
 Im ready.
 Ok.
 Hey! Jims back from jury duty.
 What was the case?
 Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," thats exciting.
 Ah! Angela had the baby!
 Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
 We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
 Got it, bimbo.
 Hes more than substantial. Hes a monster.
 Is he really five pounds?
 Because I squat with five pounds. This-  yeah, this feels like more than that.
 Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. Its not worth it.
 Hi.
 Hey, arent you an actor?
 Werent you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
 And heres the fax for you.
 Ah! Love to learn.
 So...
 Were pin twins.
 Yeah. Thats cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.
 For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andys still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I dont know, I wouldnt mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldnt want to spend that much time with Jessica.
 Absolutely. Works for me.
||
 Hey guys, any spots left?
 I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
 Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
 Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
 Im going to Florida.....and Im not coming back.
 Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you dont have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.  Oh, dont write it down unless you like it.
 Goodbye for a very very long time.
 Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
 Stanley, wake up, its pretzel day!
 Hey, wake up. Lets have some fun. Were in Florida now.
 What do you think happened?
 Hey, are you okay?
 Who says none of us are diarrheal?
 Yeah!
 Jim, are you in?
 How long will he be gone?
 Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
 Packers giving one.  Jimll probably give ours, I guess.
 Lets see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now its like if you wear yours on your shirt, youre a total dip, but if you switch, youre a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
 Do a hundred jumping jacks.
 I dont feel like it either!
  Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
 Retail consumer habits.
  Convenience.
 Service.
 Building loyalty.
 Famous, hi. Im sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
 Im sorry to have wasted your time.
 And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
 Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
 A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
 Im moving down here, you know.
 Im young, and I can  and if I cant, Im still pretty young. I guess Ill always be young.
 Hey.
 Whoa. the lights are still on.
 I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
  Hello, waffle iron.
 Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl
  a measuring cup
  Its the fuzz!
 Hey.
 Hey.
 A lot of fun.
 You should move down here with me.
 We could be roommates.
 We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, youre a guy, Im a girl-
 Maybe in six months-
 Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
 Hey, my names Tabitha. Im camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. Its me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and its working. Theres already people camped out behind me.
 I was ahead of you!
 Come on. I was in line before you.
 Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I dont want to leave yet. I havent had so much fun since seeing zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
 We are closed! Come on.
 Sorry about kicking you out. Its just, we dont want our brand associated with death.
 Youre not married yet?
 My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and were not really friends.
 Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
  Hellosi, Im home, babaloo.
  I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
 Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her.  I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I dont know how she survived without me.
 Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him Im staying in Florida.
 Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
 Can you help me? Im trying to make a video chat with Andy.
 Can you just do it?
 Erin123
  All right.
 Thats so weird. Theres something wrong with my laptop.  Oh. I fixed it.
 Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
 This is a tanned spot.
 Well, Andy, Im not coming back.
 I have a job here. I work for an old lady.
 Andy?
 Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
 How are you? Hows your family doing?
 Bye.
 Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. Thats right. Im a maid for an old lady. Her grandsons staying with us too because he ran out of money.  Listen to me, bragging away.
 Im in the bathroom.
 Yes.
 Andy, what are you doing here? Its great to see you.
 Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
 Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But Im not coming back with you.
 Hey... dont listen.
 Oh, thanks. Ive been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. Its only going to keep getting better.
 So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
 You didnt even stop to pee? Gross.
 Oh, youre doing so good. Oh my God, youre superman over there.
 Ive heard thats amazing when it works.
 Andy, I care about you and I think--
 No, go ahead.
 Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
 You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that were not meant to be.
 I know.
 Really? cause youve been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
 Irene, what would you do without me?
 Why?
 Andy wait!  Andy! Andy wait! Dont go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I dont love you. Im sorry.
 Andy.
 Lets get out of here.
 Lets go.
 No, I dont have any stuff.
 I dont have one.
 No.
 I just... theres always one around.
 I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
  Going to Pennsylvania.
 Oh. That must be nice.
 Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
 No.
  Yes.
 Yes. So do I.
 Important.
 Well, Andy, Im upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and Ill remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
   I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
  What?
 What is it? I didnt sleep well last night.
 So, Im Erin. Hi.
 Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessicas friends and theyve been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
 Andy-
 No, uh, Ill just have some gummy bears.
 But... theyre penises.
 Maybe we should just go.
 That was a really rough scene.
 Yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
 Probably from seeing that turkey.
 When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
 What? Why are we-
 Uh-oh!
  ...his girlfriends back!
 Thank you.
 When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
 There you go.  Hey. were gonna have a nice, hot date.
 Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
 We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
 Really. Its not a big deal.
 When you lost the manager job-
 Did it affect you outside of the office?
 I dont know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
 Oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Oh.
 Okay, okay.
 Dwight!
 You promised!
 Toby, doesnt HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
 Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you dont like the way that I take phone messages, here!  Take em yourself!
 And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
 And why dont you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
 Maybe well get sent to anger management together.
 Here-
 But you hurt your hand.
 Right now?
 Oh thats Andy. Hes just hanging out
 Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
 Andys just coming as my date.
 Oh God!
 Hes great. were all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, Im a dog nurse.
 Youre going to be alright
 So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. Its been great!
 Hey.
 Oh.
 Andy, if youre gonna hang out for a while, uh
 This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
 No, of course not. Its just â€“ I think its like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, its like, where does it end? So just
 Theres a call for you on line one.
 He says salvation. No last name.
 Okay, youre going to go through the hallway. Heres a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line.
 I know this is going to be a great payoff.
 But after youre manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
 Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
 No, unfortunately its true. Hes been a nightmare. And the worst part is, hes been taking it out on me.
 Hes not hitting me. But, hes been verbally abusing me-
 No, hes not making this up.
 Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
 Oh my God.
