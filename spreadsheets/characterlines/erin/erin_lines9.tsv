 Andys coming back today! Andys coming back today! Ha! Andys coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
 Im so happy for you Kelly.
 Andys coming back today!
 Andys here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andys here. New Jim, Tuna, Andys here. Pam, hes here.
 Yeah, you know, like  guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh guh.
 Yeah, seriously, its like everything on there is work.
  Oh, Pete, youve got mail.
 Well, its addressed to Customer Service so, its your mail.
 Yeah, Im alternating.
 Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
 Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. Its not a nice letter.
 Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
 You mean, put me on the news?
 Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
 Whoo!
 I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
 Yeah.
 No, I watch the news.
 This is a first for me. And, I dont get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
  Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Arent you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
 A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didnt think I knew current events.
 For Channel 11 news, Im Erin Hannon.
 For Channel 11 news... Im Erin Hannon.
 Got it. For Channel 11 news...
 Im Erin Hannon.
 Oh.
 Oh god.
 Tuh.
  The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
 Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
 Aw!
 Great! Lets get some food. Im starving.
 Im hungry.
 OK.
 Hey, even if this doesnt work out for me, Im just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe itll work out for Andy.
 Heyyy! Study buddies!
 Getting things done. Awesome!
  Sâ€il vous plaitdites-MoiUgggghhh les Bleagh!
 Im just trying to fit in better with Andys family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when Im there!
 Yeah!  Lets do it!
  Oh!
 I was intimidated by Andys family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? Shes gonna be like, â€œWhats your stance on politics?â€ Or, â€œWhat is the best war to do?â€ And, I will just be like, â€œDuhhhh!â€
 Foth aggendak!
 Foth aggendi!

 Wah!! Aggenda!!

 Vos!
 Because of your slaves.
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for â€œslave masterâ€, â€œattafrauk!â€, is a term of respect. Im learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
 Dwight, you didnt tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
  Sorry.
 Im trying. Sorry.
  Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
  I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I dont know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well.
 Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
  Just dont tell Andy, because..
 Yes!
 Yeah Jim!
 Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. Were not hostages.
 Never say that.
 I am so excited thinking about this child youre going to adopt.
||
 Hey guys.
 Pam, what are you?
 No, Im a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
 Uh, Jim, youre not dressed up at all.
 Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
||
  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
 Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
 What is with these turkeys?
 Hey! You better do â€˜Faith. You get me?
 So learn it. You all go to Cornell, youre like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin song.
 Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please.  This isnt stupid.
 The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think its kind of pathetic. But when youre with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
 Are you okay?
 Okay!
  Yeah.
 Oh well, Andy, were not moving to Cornell.
 Yeah.
 Oy. Andy, whats going on?
 Well, um, you know maybe youre the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
 Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
 Oh.
 Whats wrong?
 She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
 Dont you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
 See? I bet you wouldnt sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
 Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isnt how I would cheer up just anyone. But, its a girlfriends job to know her man and I know Andy.  Hes seriously juvenile.
 Oh no, he couldnt be more than late thirtys. Tops.
  Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.
 Oh, I just need your signature on this.
 Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
 Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
 Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
 Then screw lunch. Lets go for a sunset sail.
 Ok, well then lets leave like right now.
 Yeah! OK! Lets go.
 Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
 Alright.
 Lets do it!
 Thats yours?
 Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
 I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh its beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
 Gee, he was salty.
 What does that one do?
 I wish I had seen you do it.
 Yeah.
 Well, were doing it. Were finally having a picnic on the boat.
 Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
 As long as were on this boat, as far as Im concerned, youre the captain.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Nice!
 Do you even know what youre doing?
 Bahamas, Andy.
  Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
 Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if hed asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
 OK!
 Thanks for covering the phones.
 Fine.
 Does he have a flipper?
 He sounds like an idiot.
 Ok.
 Thanks.
 Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his familys boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
 Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
  Yeah.
 Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
 Hes in the bathroom.
 Of course.
  Eat it Stanley!
 Hello.
 I am? Hmm..   Hi, Im Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
 Hes absolutely right. Im really struggling.
 Its just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
 Yes.
 Uh!
 Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
 I know. Thats great. It just - it makes it look like theres an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
 A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isnt bad.
 But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. Its such a great cause.
||
 Yay!
 Whoo!
 Um,. its empty.
 Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. Theyre family-owned, but dont let that take away from your edge!
 Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
 Yeah!
 Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
 I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what thats code for.
 Wait, German terrorists? Thats oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
 I havent seen it.
 Mm-Mmm.
 I dont know, I just havent.
 No.
 None of this makes any sense to me!
  Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
 Okay, lets hear it.
 Die hard. Every line. Go.
 Dont change the subject.
 Movie is starting.
  Eh. That wasnt the line. Im sorry, Pete.
 I dont know. This looks pretty legit.  Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
  "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."
 Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
  Im still Andys girlfriend.
 But you can leave your arm.
 Good morning, Meredith.
 Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
   Trust me, I know what Im doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
 Holy wow, thats a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
 Oh, this is the cleanest scalp Ive ever seen. You are all clear.
 Next!
 Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice.
  Ooh yabber, lice!
  Yikers, lice.
  Oh yeah, big time lice.
 No! Stanley! If you leave now then youll get it in your car and then youll get it in your house!
 Im trying to save you from yourself!
 No, no. Its more of a nuisance really. Its not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
 To be washed.
 No, all we need is mayonnaise.
 Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and its a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
 Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. Im so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
  Once its all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
 Okay, its easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
 Oh, Creed, Im so sorry. Im...Im already partners with Pete, right Pete?
 I feel it working.  Eiffel tower!
 Dwight, are you okay!?
 Wow. He got to purple.
 Youre up.
 You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
 Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold?
 Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
 What? Everything? What, how do I make sure its in order? I  havent been trained for this.
 Hi guys!
 Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
 Thank you!
 I dont really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyones trust. About the pens.
 The pen delivery went amazing, and now Ive got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and Im not one of those people whos just like, â€œUh, sure. Ill accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your backs turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand they are just sitting here. Pam didnt tell me not to unpack them. Dont want to be a busybody, but I dont want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, its insane! Im sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. Ive never had an espresso before. Theyre good though.
 No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but its the truth, I swear.
 No, Im not!  Its not like that at all! Forget it, Im so sorry.
 Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day youve had.
 You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. Thats what happened. The pens happened.
 Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
 Its just Pete in sunglasses.
 And then we had him â€œLikeâ€ Dunder Mifflin.
 So far, were only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
 All right.
 Pete and I work well together -- not that theres anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that Im into girls. Not that Im into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
 Oh, my gosh!
 Wow. That guys really into paper.
 We did it. Youth task force forever.
 No, you go -- okay.
 Oh, Im sorry. Didnt you cheat on Andy?
 Im just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I havent done anything.
 Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And thats the end of it. Right, Pete?
 Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. Im not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
 Hello, Peter.
 Oh, no, I really dont think thats a good idea.
 I guess we dont have a choice.
 Yeah.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
 Pam, phone call.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
 Pam, phone call.
 Hes around here somewhere.
 Yeah, Darryls here. So is Santa Claus. Its just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, its Friday. Welcome to me and Darryls world of lies.
 Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And Im his helper. Its so fun.
  Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
 Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
  Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guys hilarious. Hes here today.
 Aw, cute! So therell be a bunch of kids.
 I thought thats what you were doing.
 Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
 I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
  Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
 We can do anything you want.
 I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andys coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. Hes been rude. Hes been selfish. I think hes a big jerk. And Im breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
  Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
 Great.
 Perfect.
 Andy!
  Yes.  Welcome back, buddy.
 Me too. So much. Im so happy.
 I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, Im still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
 He only emailed me four times.
 Hey!
 Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if hes gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I dont want that on my hands.
  Fish sounds great.
 Really playing the scales, huh?
 I dont love you anymore.
 I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didnt really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I dont love you.
 I just said there isnt love.
 I guess.
 You got really sunburned.
 Ugh.
 You really think we can get that back?
 Hi.
 I couldnt do it.
 Im sorry.
  Were breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
 Good morning.
 Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesnt know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Petes butt. Its sick.
 I...
 ..just have some messages for you.
 Well no, theyre from clients.
 I cant. I-
 These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
 Well I only want to talk about work right now.
 Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
 Listen to him, Andy. Hes trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
 See? We can all be friends!
 Just, get over it. It doesnt have to be awkward.
 Hi.
 Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
 Just keep walking, dont give her anything. Shell take it and run. Im Erin by the way.
 Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. Im bad at small talk.
 What, do you two know each other?
 Oh.
 Thats so random.
 Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.
 So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
 Yeah.
 How are you doing? Is it really rough?
 Gabe!
 Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
 Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
 I didnt ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
 Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, lets-
 He didnt even say that.
 Gabe, I dont-
 What is that supposed to mean?
 I dont want you to shave everything.
 What do you-!
 Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
  What color is it?
  Oh, gosh.
  Hey.
 Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think theyre from the forest where we harvest our paper.
 Hey.
 I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
 Didnt you get the memo? Its Stairmageddon!  Come on Stanley!
Â Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. Its a â€œMageddon!â€
 Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Â Come on!
 Come on. You got this. Here.
 â€œThough it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.â€
 I bet its Katie Couric. Ive been saying this for years.
 Oh, guys, its starting! Hurry!
 Andy!
 Oscar is with the Senator too?
 Oh. Hey, champions.
 I did. I got some really good sleep.
  Bzzz.
 Clarks a dead man.
 Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
 Hey. Why dont you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
 Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. Im kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susans pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
 Nice.
 Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
  I cant hear what you said.  You got your slop?
 What?
 Wow.
 Yeah!
 Dammit! Dammit, god.  Sorry. Yeah Im fine. Im fine. I got mad. Cause I dont like losing. Im just gonna- Sorry Im mad! Im mad, Im really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. Its stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. Thats how it feels.
 Sorry Im mad! I dont like losing! I thought I was going to win!
 Sorry. Sorry. Im going to go upstairs and just...
 Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said â€œis Indianâ€ and was like, â€œIs Indian what?â€ Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
 Lately, Ive been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andys calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
 Yes, theres Andy! Andy is in. Im a good receptionist, I know hes in.
 So true. Is there a question, or areâ€”what?
 Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
 I had no idea. And here Ive been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin sheep.
 Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. Thatd be fun.
 Well, how about Thursday?
 Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
 The tea in Nepal is very hot.
 The tea in Nepal is very hot.
 Close.
 Colder.
 No, I meant youre getting colder. The correct response is, â€œthe coffee in Peru is much hotter.â€
 But, thats three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol?
 Aw, heck ya!
 Darryl?! Darryl!
 You left us without saying goodbye.
 Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
 Get upstairs, mister!
 Oh, god!
 Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryls next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then well get this started.
 We have our decision.
 We want to dance with you.
 One dance, all of us together.
 Absolutely.
 Yes!
 Ok, everybody ready?
 You have to change the channel to PBS.
 But theres a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
 A paper company.
 Whoo!
 Oh!
 Phyllis!
 Hows Florida?
 Really?
 Thank you.
 Maybe sometimes. But not like â€œhateâ€ hate. More just like, â€œMom, I hate you!â€ And then she would say â€œgo to your room, young lady.â€ And Id stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then wed just have dinner together. But I dont know. Id have to meet her. Thanks.
 Yes?
 Yes? Is there a follow-up question?  Mom?
 I dont know. Ive just always been really good at dancing.
 How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
