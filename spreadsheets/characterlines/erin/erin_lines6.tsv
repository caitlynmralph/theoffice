 Kelly has an eating disorder?
 She always eats my lunch.
 We should do something.
  I am so happy youre eating again.
 I heard it from Michael.
 Thats really great, you guys.
 Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
   I think hes around here...
   David Wallace is calling.
   Should I tell him youll call him back?
  Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
 David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
 Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.
 Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and well get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
 Oh no. That wouldnt be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
 Oh. Gross.
  Go Meredith. Nice moves.
 Oh yeah. What else you got?
 What else you got?
  Are you in a lot of pain?
  People say you cry all the time.
  If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
  Do you think they canceled the wedding?
  Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. Hes the person you should talk to.
 In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that.
 You dont have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play."
 Yes?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 How do you return coffee?
 Theyre back!
 Hi!
 Coco Leche! Thats my favorite!
 Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
  I think it will too, but Ill just check with him, though.
 Oops, sorry.  Oops.
 Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
 Pam, were all set.  Yum.
 Michael, youre all set at Botticellis. I changed the reservation to two people.
 Fun!
   Hi Dwight!
  Night Michael.
 I confirmed with Raskin Design and theyre expecting the both of you in an hour.
 They said the both of you.
 Youre soaking wet.
  Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
 Michael, people are asking questions.
 Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called.
 He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didnt mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
 Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.
 They want you to pay for it.
 Well, they said you stepped on its head. He did not suffer.
 $300.
 Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I dont accidentally read them.
 Thanks.
 How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
 Yeah, he is!
 Hes, like, the coolest person Ive ever met.
 Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? Cause he is.
  These are amazing.  You took all these?
  Oh just by like friends.
 Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say its urgent.
  Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
  Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
  How about you?
  Hello.
  Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
  Well, you know ol Nellies always up for a romp in the hay.
  Yeah, my boudoirs always open.
  I havent seen it.
   Of course, Nathaniel.
   Where are you taking me?
   Savannah?  Thats a far way from Scranton.
 No.  Did you?
  I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
  Wallace is on the phone.  Hes returning your call.
  I dont think so.  I think its David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
 Michael? The limos here for you.
 He said limousine, so...
 Its like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
 Frankies Dirty Joke of the Day?  Theres a bunch of those.
 Theres a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say "Delivered."  Should I delete all of those?
 Thats why you have a "Sent Mail" folder.
 Theres about 30 news alerts for "Nip Slip."
 "Nip slip."
 Well...
 Oh, my God.
 Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
 Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didnt.
 Weve already rescheduled seven times.
 I can print out a new itinerary with Pams name on it.
 Wow!
  Youre famous.
 Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
 No.
 No, theres financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
 The principal told me that 90% of Scotts Tots are on track to graduate, and thats 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadnt made that promise, a lot of them wouldve dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
 Really?
 Ive always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
 Yes, but Im terrible at math so...
 Seriously?
 Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. Im not sure Ive earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I cant take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
 Its so edgy!
 It stings a lot.
 I keep trying to figure out whos sending me these gifts.
 So far no one will admit to it.
 Is it you?
 Seriously?
 What?
 Do you want me off the call too Michael?
 It was a little much Andy.
 What were you thinking?
  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how bout you?
 Guys, um, whos Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, whos coming tomorrow?
 Well, I saw them in there.
 I think when Andy finally asks me out hes going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I cant wait to see what he comes up with.
 No, you?
 Nothing. Its wide open.
 Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
 Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
  Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
 You named them?
 Uh, yeah I do remember.  Aw, they love each other.
 Wow, it smells really good too.
 Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
 Michael, Im worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
 Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
 You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and hes manager.
 Whos hungry?
 Its ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 230 and say "Whos hungry?"
 Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
 Its a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
 Oh sure.
 Well.
 Geez louise.
 Well, everyone got one.
 Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
 Its no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I cant compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldnt he be? Hes got it all.
 Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
 Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
 Oh!
  Ooh, spooky.  But why?
  I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
    Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
  Um, stimulate the nipples.
  Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  Were already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
  Theres nothing in it.
  I didnt know we had a tape measure.
    You wanted to see me?
  Oh, boy!  ...  Whats that sound?
  I dont know what to say.
  Okay.
  Michael, could I talk to you privately?
  Im so sorry if I gave you the impression Im into Kevin, but Im not.  I like Andy.
  Im sure hell be fine.
  Really?
  I dont want anyone to die.
  Hi.
  Did you grow up around here?
  So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
  Hey.
  I have really enjoyed our time together.
  I want to continue working on our friendship.
  Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
  And, youre my friend.
  And I hope that Im your friend...  And, maybe...
  Well...
  Okay, good.
  Its busy.  Why dont I keep trying, and then Ill give you the confirmation in a bit?
    You cant talk to me like that.  I didnt do anything wrong.  Ive been having a tough day today.
  You read the fax.
  Oh, my God.  Thats amazing.  Let me just fax this, and Ill check my planner.
  Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
  Everyday is fine.  Or...
  Thursday?
  Okay.
 Welcome back, "Dad!"
 Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
 Oh, no Im fine, I just have a little indigestion.
 Yes.
 Im a little sick but I dont want to miss my date with Andy. Ill get better. Whenever Im sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
 This fax came for you.
 Uh...
 Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
 Well...
  Oh! Andy!
 Im in my jammy-jams!
 Oh, thanks. Come in!
 Your hands cold.
 Yeah, have some more blanket.
 Youre awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
 Hes my foster brother.
 Hey! My feet arent smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!
 None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
 Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
 Im so sorry I was so sick.
 Something came for you, Michael.
 Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads.
  Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot.  Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
 Lower.
 Lower
 I emptied it in the dumpster. With Tobys baba ganoush.
  Go on. I have warm blood.
Sure, if you are.
Talk to me that way again, and Ill cut your face off.
Exactly.
Quiet.
Whats this game?
Oh I know.
Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.
Yes, okay. Yeah, thats smart.
No.
I get it.
Okay.
 Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
What we said to do.
I was flirting with a man.
The movies. I dont know.
 You love drama.
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you.
  Welcome back!
 I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
 Well, happy Bosss day. There wouldnt be a secretary if there was no boss.
 I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworths.
 Just the two of us.
 Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworths, but...
 Oh.
  Okay.
 I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
 I would have chosen the 1490s.
 Cause America was discovered.
  And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I dont know, I couldnt keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So its like... I dont mean that I didnt like my foster home. I did like it. I just didnt have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
 Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
 How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
 Hes the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
 Yeah I love that.
 What?
 Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
 Why wouldnt he tell me that?
 They had sex?
 Uhhhh, they were engaged?
  Uh-oh...
||
 In the Foster home, my hair was my room.
||
 Lunch was fine.
 I dont know. It was lunch, Andy.
 God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? Its easy.
  I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
 I dont want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
 Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
 Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didnt know?
 Who are you?! I dont know you!
 Thanks.
 You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
 Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
 I want to throw up just thinking about it.
 Really?
 It was Andy, wasnt it?
 I hope you find what youre looking for.
 Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? Whats your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
 How long were you guys together?
 A year? You were together for a year?
 I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
||
 Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
 I cant trust Andy anymore.
 Its Andys fault.
 Oh, I like his butt.
 You tricked me!
 Buenos dias, Miguel.  Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
 Holy cow. Id be so happy.
 I know. I meant Id be happy for them.
 Mm!
 Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
 Yeah.
 Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
 Great.
 Kelly got into the minority training program.
 Maybe youd be more comfortable in your own office.
 Uh, no.  Wait, yes.
 Yeah.
  Its so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
  Do you want me to go back to the store?
  This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
  After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? Thats what Pam told me.
  Thats okay. You probably shouldnt keep a baby up that late, though.
  We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
  Hes coming.
  Hi Michael.
  Thanks, Michael.
  What about Kelly?
   Is this a joke?
  Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
 Andy?
 I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
 Yeah.
