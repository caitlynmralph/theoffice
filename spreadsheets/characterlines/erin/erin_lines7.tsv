 Yes, of course.
 Whos the guy who invented the peanut?
 Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God hes my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didnt have to, but... its been great.
 Thats a really tight argument.
 Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
 Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
 Im sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
  Yeah!
  I dont know.
  Dwight
  Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you dont ever get to see your pictures. If its an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I dont care if I forget today.
 Andy?
 Did you write this?
 Who did?
 Who is he?
 I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe cant come. Sorry.
 Oh, who else is going?
 Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
 I really wanted to see Andys play, because hes so, so talented. But Ive been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. Its almost like a babysitters club.
 I just didnt think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
 Im sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
 Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
 Why dont I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
 Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
 Yes. Oh, Im so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
 Oh, no. Im so glad were hanging out again outside of work.
 Okay, I kill you now.
 This is awesome.  Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andys cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? Thats broth, Gabe. Okay, I-Ill see you soup.  Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and Im really sorry that I missed your play, but next time Ill be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
  Terrific!
 Andy...
 Andy, arent there also negatives to sex?
 Unplanned pregnancy.
 Your two oclock.
 Gotcha.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
 Oh!
 Kelly! Great costume!
 He says no.
  A... S... S... H... E... T?
 Ah!  Thats enough.
 Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
 Di-Did you say vampire?
 I think its really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
  Get in quick.
 So its faster.
 Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
 No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
 Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Merediths minivan.
 I bet. You guys.
 Oh, Lake Wobblegones on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
  They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house.
 Its pronounced wacko.
 Michael!
 Gabe and I are having a party, and everyones invited, and its at his house apartment and were gonna watch Glee.
 Yeah its a TV show...
 Uhh. Its just that its our first party together so...
  Okay, sorry.
 Wait which one?
 Good me too!
 I dont know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but theres this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that dont go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
 Mhmm! Id love it if you were there.
 You and Michael are always the life of the party!
 Why would I keep you from coming?
 Why would I hide it!
  Its make your own pizza night. Isnt Gabes place so nice?
 Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
 Those posters used to be real French ads.
  The shows starting. The shows starting! The shows starting! Shows starting!
 I wasnt recording it.
 Wait, why do you have to record it?
 Jim.
 Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some  help so,  he was wondering if you could help him.
 Look who I found!
 Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
 Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
 Whats the longest thing youve ever seen?  For me it was the tale from Jets.
  Are you having a good time?
 Andy you look awful!
 Are you alright?
 Oh, uhm, like three months.
 I dont know.
  I have to go Phyllis.
  You did this?
 Why dont you like him?
 I care if
 Um, everyone was getting their drivers license.
 Sure.
 Pam.
 I dont wanna be a lousy snitch.
 Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
 But its not for--
 All that color.
 How was the dentist?
 Oh, no.
 Oh my God.
 According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
 Whats America gonna do?
 What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea dont you?
 I think thats what theyre doing to me. I cant prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
||
 Fire him. No, show mercy.
 Right, yes.
 I didnt want to miss it.
 Good.
 Guys, whos Holly?
 Wow.
 Ive looked her up online... theres nothing about her. Shes made no impression on the internet.
 Oh...
 Hello.
 Im really sorry, I cant help you. Im waiting for my boss pretty friend to arrive.
 Oh, youre Holly! Of course. Sorry.
 To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
 Yeah, I mean, maybe Hollys not in any position to be shooing guys away.
 I dont get it! Im sorry. I just, I dont get it!
 Thats not true. I dont know her enough to make a decision even.
  No.
 I really think youre better off.
 Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
 Hello.
 I know who you are, and I think you should go.
  Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said its snot.  I am so sorry.
 Okay, champagne.
 Sponge.
 Gummi bears and gummi worms.
 Ukuleles happy?
 Chocolates.
 Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
 And did you get the tickets?
 Im really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, hell be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
 Go!
 Oh, yeah!
 Want some company?
 I went to Portugal.
 No.
 Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
 Hey! Gabe.
 This is all I could find.
 One, two, three.  I did it! I did a cartwheel!
 You want to keep this?
 Do you want to keep this?
 Do you want to keep this?
 Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
 Oh its...
 Michael?
 Ooh. Wait, Michael?
  Down... there.  Is "jlp" a word?
 No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!"
 Im playing Scrabble with Gabe, and Ive never won a game.
 The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far Ive seen "The Shining", "Rosemarys Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
 Really?
 Yes.
 Because Im playing to win. Im playing "moo", Im playing "milk". Whatever it takes.
 Uh...
 Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
 The cow jumped over the moon.
 Wait. Why?
 When I win...
 Were gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
 Yes.
 Apoplexy.
 Got it.  Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
 I played "ape."
 I know. You get to pick.
 Yes?
 Theres a "Shrek" two?!
 Ohh.
 Oh my gosh!
 Holly is ruining Michaels life. He thinks she is so special. And shes so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like shes a perfect 40. Its nuts.
 You know what? Why dont you stay and Ill go?
 Its kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
 He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
 No.
 Hey, you were in there forever.
 She wandered off like an idiot.
 Orville Tootenbacher. Thats Michaels millionaire character that...
  Its Michael!
 You knew.
 Where did he go, Holly?
 Okay. We fan out...
 Good. We dont need her.
 From my secret admirer. Thats you!
 "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. Its a romantic scavenger hunt!
 But, theres no clue.
 I cant, cause theres no clue.
 Oh.
 Psst! Psst!
 Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
 Okay.
 Oh! No, no, no, no. Its not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
 Yes!
 Oh, is he...
 Andy.
 So tell me about your new girlfriend.
 Aww, cute.
 Thats Gabes boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
 No, come on.
  Come on!
 Ha!
 Dont mind us. You keep working.
 Oh, my God. Its a song.
 What do you think is on it?
  Not if were talking like this. I think its okay. He doesnt seem to hear us.
 Darryl.
 No, hes not.
 Okay. Then no more talking. Lets just play the song.
 What do you...
 I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
  Oh. Cool.
 Super romantic.
 Yeah. Did you not see it?
 Hanks.
 Sorry.
 Oh. One Erin Special, please.
  Thats my favorite.
  B-9.
 Like a benign tumor.
 Oh, yes. Theres a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentines kiss."
 Mm. Oh. Were suppose to...mmm
 Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybodys dying to see it.
  Sorry were late. Gabe fell in the shower.
 Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
 Thank you Pam.
 Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!
 Pam gave it to me!
  I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
  Oh! If youre going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks.
  If youre not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
  Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
  For Petes sake it just needs to be done!
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
 Oh, thats how Pam does it. I just copy her. Shes sort of a living legend.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
 Oh, assist.
 Yeah, ok, good.
 What do you think?
  ...Im so sorry. Sorry.
 Deangelo, did you order a barber?
 Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
  Deangelo, this box came for you.
 Oh hey, didnt see you.
 I dont know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I dont know. Maybe Im going to the Dundies!!
 Get away from the car, hes gonna see you.
  Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
 Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry.
 I eat lunch in the car now.  Its my alone time. Its just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
 I, really dont like spending time with him.
 Thank you Jim.
 I cant just dump him Pam, Im not like you, I cant be mean.
 DeAngelo, Jos on the phone for you.
 Thank you, thank you! This is the first award Ive ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I dont feel it. And I think thats because Im not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
 Im not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me.
  Gabe!
 You cant be in here. This is a ladys room!
 Hey Creed.
 I really think you should leave.
 Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
 Gabe!
 I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And hes begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think Im in love with someone else.
 Andy.
 I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
 Im not attracted to Kevin.
  Extension 147.
 I know.
 Absolutely.
  Deangelo?
 Who should I say is calling?
 Ooh, about what?
 I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
 Oh! Darryls funny.
  200 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or -
 Hes just gonna call back.
  What?
 Dwight doesnt trust robots to give us our messages.
 Im taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
 Andy!
 Ill go with you.
 Navy blue. Little red anchors.
 She had so much -
 Hey.
   Its good. I really hope you get it!
  Still, Id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair.
  You in the bosss chair!
   Did you hear anything?
  So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
  Yeah. Im sure I was just another Porkys baby.
  But why not find out.
  I think Andy should be the boss. Hes just so great. If Im being objective, then Darryl, of course.
   I... I dont think I can do that.
  Well, thats not my personality.
  Yes?
  I do really want him.
   Jo, you have one more candidate. Hes a burn victim.
   Hes all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
   Ahh!
  Ive been turned into a puppet!
  I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
  And theres only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
   I need the most special thing in the office.
  A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!
   Oh.
   Ive done it all my life.
  I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that Im standing in front of  and facing, and Im like...
