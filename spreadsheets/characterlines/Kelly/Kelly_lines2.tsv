 It was you.
 Yeah, it was.
  No. No, just something that was written in the ladies room wall.
 "Spicy Curry", whats that mean?
 Yeah, but whyd you give it to me?
 This is a bowler-
 Yeah, but everyone else-
 Im okay!
 Let go of me!
 Definitely, definitely, Jim.
 How about you Pam?
  Why is that?
 Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
 Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I dont really play soccer or anything.
 Hi-yah!
 Wow, thats actually pretty cool Dwight.
 What?
 Wait, not Roy.  Say its not your fiance.
 You said "constructive complements"; that doesnt make any sense.
 I thought you read these every week.
 Im sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  Theres gotta be something else we can talk about.
 Oh, good, that was from me.
  Yikes.
 Thats like, the creepiest thing that Ive ever seen.
 I will steal the iPod.
 Damn it.
 Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
 Hey.
 I dont know.
 Wait, Michael?
 Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
 Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
 I took the tags off already.
 Yeah, hes dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
 Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
 Listen, you dont have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
 Youd look like an angel. Im seriously going to cry.
 Pam?
 Jim, why didnt you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
 Are you moving back here?
 Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
  Weird.
  Im serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because arent all hangers like that big?  So I dont understand why the closet engineer didnt think of that.  So now Im doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
  Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
 Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
 Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  Hes so cute.  I like him
  But its so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 930.
  Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but dont tell him that, okay?  Just tell him Im, like, up for anything.  I mean, Im not a slut, but who knows?
 You just asked a girl out on the phone!
 Ill tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
 I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
 Oh, me too.
 What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
 I mean thats a baseball term, right?
  ...and you went to Chilis and he got to second base with you.
  He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
 You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with Michael.
 How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
 Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
 And it was so funny cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasnt making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, whats taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didnt know what to say.
 So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
 Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? Im embarrassed.
 Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
 So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
 I dont know what hes thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
  Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
 I mean, I know its Valentines Day, or whatever, but theres totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
 OK, Thats cool. I completely understand.
 Its frustrating, because wed be so perfect together.
 Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
 Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan?
 Is Brad okay?
 This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
 Whyd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
 But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  Ive always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
 Oh.
 Yep.
 Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Dont you just love kids, Angela?
 God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
 ...that I thought you should know ...
 I think something a little fishy is going on.
 Yeah. I mean, Ive been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ...
 Second opinion on what?
 Oh, no! I was watching Greys Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
 I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sisters.
 Dont be scared! Youre good! Youre good!
 And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but Im so small and all Id eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
 Six.
 So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress!  One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything.  I mean not everything, Jim.  I promise, Im not that kind of...
 Were having the best conversation.
 So, I was looking so hot...
 I didnt file a complaint. I was just talking.
 To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
