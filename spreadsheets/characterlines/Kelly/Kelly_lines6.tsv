 If they get married before I do, Im going to kill myself.
 Its Eric and Megan.
 WHAT??
 Really?
 Andy Bernard??
  Me too!
 Well then, whats the one true rumor?
 Are we just gonna wait here?
 Its true!
   Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
   Is Ryan going?
   Heres the deal.  I really want to go but Im not gonna go if Ryan doesnt go, because its kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because Id really like to be there to support Jim.
 I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. Its so much fun. But I guess if Im really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, Id have to go with L.C.  Heidis a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
  Whats going on?
 What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
 No!  How is that gonna repair Ryans car?!
 This is so much cooler. We feel like werre in a limo and youre our driver.
 Blow my brains out.
 Lame! What else you got, Andy?
 How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
  Im so happy for you...
   Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
  Well, I think Id look really hot in one.  Whered you get your fedora?
  I think Im gonna get the same fedora as you.
  Well, I think I have that persona.
  What the hell is a mallard?
  Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
  If you take it back, Ill scream.
   Youre so cool.
 Lulu from The Fifth Element.
 What keeps your glasses on?
 Oh my God I love it.
 Yeah.
  Pam.  Shes going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
 No, its a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
  It has almost no calories.
    Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?
 Im going to have some cake.
 What psycho would send that as a gift?
 Hi David!
  Jim.... Jim!
  Oh my God.
 I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy youre supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
  You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, youre everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
 I know, obsessed with me much?
 What did yours say?
 Oh! You scared me!
 I didnt see you. And you were there all along.  Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
 Bye, Andy.
  Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you dont like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
 Who?
 Who, what?
  Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals dont work, and you can poop yourself.
  Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
  Im not single.  I have a man.
 I dont want to bring my friends, why cant it just be the two of us?
 Well why dont you invite your friends?
 Yeah, where are your kids?
 I want to watch the Kardashians! I dont want to watch boring -
  Its about a family. A real-life family.
  Youre adorable. You need to go for it.  Im going to be, like, mad at you if you dont -
 Why?
 What drama?
 So unnecessary.
 I mean, if the salesmen werent acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldnt be so bad - did you ever think of that?
 Dont use your cute baby to make us like you.
Were focusing, were focusing, we cant talk.
Only three tickets.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
 Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldnt give me a refill.
  "My name is Kevin, Im an accountant." See I did the voice.
 But parody is always derivative.
 Do they still get paid?
 But youre an accountant too.
  This is the second time that youve sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. Ive been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
 I dont know if she was white.
 Yeah.
 Well, they say its because of texting, but maybe youre right.
 Never thought of myself as an executive before.
 I cant think of any CEOs, any race.
 I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
 Well, theres a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
 Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. Its so dorky.
 Just put it in your pocket.
  Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
 This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now Im trying to make her anorexic.
 Oh, that is so good.
 Oh, thats okay. Ryan coached me.
 Would you ask that same question if I was white? Were so in.
 When I become executive, Im gonna make Ryan manager.
 Namaste.
 Hello.
 Sometimes my bangs cover it.
 I do find that offensive, actually.
 For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
 Dwight What are you doing?
 God, I hate you so much!
  And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that Im not gonna need anymore.
 Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
 Thank you, Dwight.
 Ill never forget everything that youve done for me.
 Because I never forget anything.
 Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Changs when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
 Wait, thats crazy far. Are you sure shes not cheating?
 Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
 Did Michael get them for you?
 Where?
 Claires? Zales? Rickys? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
 Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governors Place?
  Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
  Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
  Cause its next to they baby section, okay?
  I dont really know why youre screaming at me right now.
  Thats Merediths cake. Its her birthday.
  Hey guys, sorry Im late.
 Guys, I couldnt help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, its as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
 Of course Im the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I cant control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
 That idea sucks.
 Uh, if you turn me in, Im turning in Darryl.
