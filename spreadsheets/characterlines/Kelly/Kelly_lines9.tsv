 Hey, Ryan!
 Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
 Drake is your babys name?
 That is an amazing name. Im obsessed with Drake. His last album it just touched me to pieces.
 Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. Im obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
 Oh.
 Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isnt this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
 I dont know, Ryan. Baby Drake didnt look so good.
 You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?
