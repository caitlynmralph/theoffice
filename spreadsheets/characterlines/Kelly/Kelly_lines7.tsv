 This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, Im, like, really smart now. You dont even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, whats the biggest company in the world?" And Id be like, "blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah," giving you the exact right answer.
 I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
 Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
  You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses.
  What did I say?
  I talk a lot, so Ive learned to just tune myself out.
  "Big mistake! Huge!"
  You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
  I thought they were kind of cute.
 Ooooh!
 What time is it?
 What?
 Is that a blow torch?!
 Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
 I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
 Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
 Im on Sheryl Crows side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
  me!
 Josh Duhamel.
 I get that. I get that.
 Um, if Im out, Im going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
 Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
 Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
 If I have to vote for someone, I dont want it to be someone who can beat me.
 I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
 Try "Jesus."
 Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out?
  No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesnt know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later hes this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
 And what was with Jesses sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, its just. Its irresponsible.
 Finn.
 Rachel.
 You have to stop.
 You know what? Im so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
 The shows back on, what happened?
 Oh my God what song was that?
  What song was it?
 Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim?  Cause we missed it!
 Ahhh! Whats going on?!?!
 Good luck Michael!
  Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
 I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you dont have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and youre not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!"
 I think Im gonna stay here.
 I do, I do. This isnt right.
 But I--its not right.
 Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
 Good. And the dry cleaners?
 Good.
 I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
 Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
 Michael, how do I create a new tab?
 Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
 Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
 Its present time, you guys.  Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
 Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do."
 Its a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
 I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
 I said, "I wonder." I didnt say, "I think."
 Blankets, what am I, five?
 Hes rubbing his neck.
 Well, youre almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
 So wheres the ring?
 That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
 Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. Youre re-gifting this to me.
 Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
 This is a fast food receipt from April.
 God, how many number nines did you order?
 What happened? Is there a ring?
  Come on!
 Wow.
 Yes, I told everyone.
 Oh, God, please stop!
 Why are you eating stem first?
 Youre killing him, Michael!
 Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
 Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
 My resolution was to get more attention.
 Cake.
 Oh, baby.
 But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
 Who am I? Im Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
 It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch."
 I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. Its ringing.
 Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
 Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
 Come on Scott, please? Its me.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah bitch.
 Whoo!
 Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
 Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.
 The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
 We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
 And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
 Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
 God baby, you know, peoples reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
 Ryan, I changed my mind.
 And who is on my side?
 Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
 Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
 What are you referencing?
 Dont do it Kevin, thats the fake kind of apology.
 This is textbook. Its so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like its some offense to have feelings. Dont do it Kevin.
 Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. Youre blocking my table with your giant body.
 Screw you man. People like my stuff.
 You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
  Ill get that you guys. Dont... its just... you know...
 Oh, hi!
 Have we met before?
 Well, I guess Ill go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
 And that is what you call a meet cute.
  What?!
 Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
 I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
 What?
 Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
 Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
 You really would?
 Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
  Mom, Ryans taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, hes not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He wont ever stand us up again.
 When Deangelos around.
 All the time.
 Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
 Thats like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
 You chose this job over that job?
 Im sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I cant do this.  I cant do this.  Im sorry.  I just cant do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasnt had a real job here in years.
 No, hes just a big fraud, Deangelo.  Hes like Rango.  He doesnt work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didnt save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
 Hes not saying anything!
 Thats not fair, I mean, Ive been working here for such a long ti--
 Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
 Its none of your business, actually. Its very medical and personal.
 Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
 Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
 Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
  Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
  Well, I manage my department, and Ive been doing that for several years now. And, god, Ive learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
  Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
  What was that?
   Am I not a serious candidate?
  I dont have any, assh***.
  Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
  Uh,... can it be in private?  Dont worry, its not about you.  As Minority Executive, I think its my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I dont think its professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
   Very, very interesting. And you know what? Im impressed.
  I dont know, Jim, cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
  Yeah, it was a great deal.
  I dont know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
  That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
  Im sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, Im a singer, Im a fashion designer.
  You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ughh.
  Im sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
  I dont care. They can just vote.
