 She looks awful.
 Thats Buddhist.
 No.
 If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
 Have a seat, Ill write it down.
 I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
  Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
 Oh.
 Can we speak privately about our relationship?
 Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
 A lot. Black guys mostly.
 What?!
 I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
 Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I dont think you ever cared about me.
 Well, I hope youre still committed because Im pregnant.

 And guess what buddy,  I am keeping it.
 Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
 We have a date!
 You know, some place romantic and expensive.
 You know what, youre right. Im feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.
 I dont understand what the big deal is.

 If thats from Ryan, does it mention if hes seeing anybody?
  Waaay too tight.
  Why is it so tight?
  Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
  You had carbs?  Thats awful.
  But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."
  Thanks.
  Not so much anymore.
 Youre so funny.
 I invited him.
 Okay.
 Umm, see you later tonight.
 Okay, bye honey.
 Ryan used me an object.
 What do you mean you have plans tonight?
 Well, you have to make a choice, its either your daughter, or me.
 Okay, I see how it is.  Oops.
||
 Well, I just need to know where this is going.
 Dont you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person Ive ever met in my entire---
  Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that Ive ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what theyre thinking?  What kind of game is that?
 Ahhh!!
 What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
 Guess whose boyfriend it is?
 Ill give you a hint Its not my boyfriend. I think its a guy over here .
 I dont talk trash, I talk smack. Theyre totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like Youre ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
  Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
  Jim couldnt hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
  Were Jims parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
  Yeah, thats what I thought.
 Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
 Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one!  Hey, hey, you, you! I dont like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
 What?
 OK. Bring it on.
 Think you can handle this?
 OK. Volley for serve, P.
 O.
 If Id have created a website with as many problems, Id kill myself.
 Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
 Now hes never gonna come.
 Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
 Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody Im dating Barack Obama!
 I cant believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
 I feel weird.
 I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. Im gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison."
 Can I be your bridesmaid?
