 Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because youre not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.
 I know, right?  Probably a lot.
 OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!"  Except dont say "Kelly," say your own name.  Or if youre bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones,  and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
  Absolutely!
  I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
 OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
