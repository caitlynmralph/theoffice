 (planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
 I cant get down.
 How is this a pizza party?
 Yeah, well, thats just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
  Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
 Everybody hates those endings!
 No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
 Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. Theyre for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. Its like yeah Tucker, youre so street.
 So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
 Oh dont try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
 Thatll work.
 Bye.
 Oh, god.
 I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldnt come in till noon and I wouldnt do anything I didnt wanna do. I mean Im getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
 I dont get the reason for this party.
 Whats the reason, Andy? Whats the reason?
 I am so cold.
 This is ridiculous! Why cant there just be two Kate Middletons?
 Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasnt even here.
  Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
 What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
 Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
 1, 2, 3!
 Thank you.
 Fine.
 Mmhmm.
 I guess.
 I try not to think about it.
 Never marrying.
 What emails are you talking about?
 Thats not that bad actually.
 Um, no were not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
 Whawhats Dwights mothers name.
 Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!!  Shut it down! Shut it down!
 Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You dont want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
 It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathys hot.
  Eww!
 I mean, I guess hed be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if hell get hair plugs.
 Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? Its called being a nice person.
 Im gonna write something mean on his wall.
 Oh my God, kill me!
 Yeah.
 Pitiful.
 Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
 Isnt Gettysburg like three hours away?
 I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
 I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
 Its really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
 Eww, what is that?
 Cool.
 Do you think thats what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
 Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
 Yo.
 On it.
 Jessica, did you just fart?
 And that, is how its done.
 No, its Lamar Odom. If itd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when hes at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
 What!
 Cause its like, really...
 Having fun.
 Tu Bishvat!
 Hey, is it true that youre not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
 I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
 Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
 I dont know. It looks pretty great to me.
 Yeah, thanks. Im really glad I found it.
 Shh. Of course Im superstitious. What are you talking about?
 Oh God.
 Youve broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it.
 Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
 So then this means nothing to you.
 Damn girl! Your body!
 You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
 Why?
 Hell yeah.
 Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
 For you maybe.
 I dont know how Im going to live here without you.
 Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
 Were screwed.
 Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know its for me.  Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
 Andy, pick up the phone!
 Im dying!
 Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
 Guys, were not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
 I thin were gonna need to here those texts.
 No. Theres no way in hell Im leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
 Boring.
 Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, cause three dots means to be continued, four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
 Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
 Oh, my god!
 Will someone please explain whats going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, its like my life is buffering.
 So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- â€œHow to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.â€
 No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
 I was a twelve year old bully.
 Yeah, thats not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
 Good. Lets go.
 You think youre so pretty! Â Well youre not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
 Take that! Â Not so pre-violent anymore!
  Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
 Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
 Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didnt lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
 Oh, great.
 Its no bother, you guys are our friends.
  Why?
 Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
 God I dont even remember what that fight was about.
 Hes so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, "Kelly, that will be the color of our children."
 Which time?
 Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
 I wasnt going to interrupt.
 Ryan.
 You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
 I do.
 I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
 That was really cool.
 Just keep chatting. Im just checking my makeup in your webcam.
 Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
 Im throwing out all my mirrors.
 Now you look at me like youre adoring me, Im gonna look at the camera like I dont even know youre there.
