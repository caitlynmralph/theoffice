  Just leave me alone!
   I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
  I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
  Its just some of us are taking this really seriously.
  I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  Its going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I dont get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  Its from Mexico.
  Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
  Cool.
  Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but Im dating Darryl, still, and were like crazy in love so...
  Its a small office.
  ...what else do people like?
  I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
  Nope.
 What?
 Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then Ill just take up smoking.  Ill do it.  I dont care.
 Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
 And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
 Um, so youre in the tub with everything?
  Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
 Oh, Im Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
 Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
 Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
 Oh, from the insurance commercials!
  Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
 Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
 Call your mom, Michael.
 So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so Im out $100.
 Yeah, uh, this is all of them Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, its the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. Whats that doing there?
 Oh, my God. You scared me.
 What are you talking about?
 You always say that, and I almost never know.
 Are you accusing me of something?
 You just cant come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldnt give you such bad customer reviews.
 Dwight, get out of my nook!
 Yeah, hes weird.
 OK.
 Um, were cool.  Bye.
 Whats going on?
 Nothings going on.
 What? I -- I dont know what youre talking about. This is the first Im hearing about this.
 I love your tie, Michael.
 I was raped.
 OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didnt come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didnt even show up, and so youre bad friends.
 See? I wasnt lying.
 I was lying.
 No problem.
 For you.  Im with Darryl.
 Is that supposed to impress me?
  No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so Im not gonna flaunt it and Im not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
  What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
 Mmmm.... mmm. This cant happen again.
 Yeah.
 I dont know.  I mean, its well-written and all, I just---
 Oh my God.  Hes going to kill us.
 Oh! He says its cool.  He said, "Its cool".
 Thats all he wrote.
 Mmm hmm.
 Mmm hmm. Its like a fairy tale!  Mmmm...
 Were back together again baby.
 They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
 Oh!
 Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
 Um, Im just gonna hand it to him right now.
 Mmhmm.
 Punch him, Toby!
 Hi, Michael.
 Cant do what?
 Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
 Oh, can I come?
 So youre dumping me?
 Okay?
 Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
 Yeah, cause this is kind of a drag.
 I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
 Theres Andy, hes in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
 Yeah, shut up Kevin.
 No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isnt hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!
 Dwight!
 A vacation.
 I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
 Screw you.
 Oh yeah? Screw you too.
 My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasnt even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
 Screw you guys. Youre dead to me.
 Yeah, screw you, beefer, I dont forget your birthday, I would never do that.
 I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
 In a way, its good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
 Ice Cream.
 Stop yelling at me!
 I didnt do anything!
 I was kickin it.
 My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his fathers. And I just thought itd be really romantic, like Thelma and Louise, but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I cant believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
 You did? I wanna see the cake.
 I hate it.
 Well, theres no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, theres nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesnt have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
 I mean, I dont even know what the theme is. Whats the theme?!
 Those arent... themes. Theres always a theme.
||
 This doesnt look good.
||
 You dont hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
 Cool.
 I love it.
 You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
  Thank you.
 Im too excited to sleep.
 So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.   Roses are red, violets are blue, its time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
 Decorating.
 Yeah, thanks.
 Well, his heart was in the right place.
 You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
 Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, its like a fairy tale.
 She could be.
 Aww.
 Michael, its time.
  My god, hes like a black George Clooney.
  Thank you.
  Should I seduce him?
  I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but its so worth it, you guys.
  I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
  What?! Move!
  Hey! Is that his scarf?
  Michael get to the good part.
  So that is why I have to leave at 5 00 on Tuesday, its to pick up my little sisters from school.  Were really tight. Were like the Kardashians..
  Yeah I dont like talking...
  Yep, we were in the middle of something so why dont you just...
  So you should be heading back to your desk.
  Shes such a special person.  And shes turning 50 this year.
 Where will you be staying while youre in Scranton?
 So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
 And...
 Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
 Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
 Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
 Hey, guys.
