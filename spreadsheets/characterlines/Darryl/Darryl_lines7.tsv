 It says decaf. You get me decaf?
 My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I dont know how were going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. Hes only been here for a week, and I hate him.
 Hes got to go, Mike.
 Dont dont bother Luke. Got it.
 Whats wrong with a level playing field?
  Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that.
  Im telling you how to do this man.
  I saw a TLC show on Kate Walshs home office. All corkboard.
  Right in here?
 Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
 No, its my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. Its his first play. He didnt even audition.
 Shhh. If we dont listen to the overture, we wont recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
 Hey!
 Silent. Look, congratulations.
 I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
 You didnt have to boo him.
 How would you like it if we booed you?
 Boo! Boo!
 Boo! Boo!
 Andy, sing us another song.
 Im sure they dont regret having their child, lets move it to the pros.
 Condoms.
 Ohh. Ok. I didnt realize we were doing trick questions. Whats the safest way to go skiing? Dont ski!
  We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
 I dont know whos got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
 Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. Its all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
 Yeah.
 I have no idea what his problem is, thats just my standard advice. Its good advice right?
 Im very busy with time-sensitive work.
 If you dont enter them immediately, you forget. What?
 Nah. I play for pleasure.
 I wouldnt enjoy that.
 Oh, yeah?
 How much?
 Thats crazy money. Ill take forty.
 One second, one second, one second.  So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
 But youre singing it.
 No, thats not a good idea. I dont see that as a very good song.
 Oh, I never sing with soul.
 Songs about truth.
 Whats something you really care about?
 More universal.
   Couldnt get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
 Go ahead.
 Which me am I gonna be today?
 Oh, dont worry about it.
 Yeah.
 One, two, three, hit it.
 Ill be your croak monsieur.
 I find you absolutely ribbiting!
 Scoopity-splash!
 Dracula.
 Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
 Im just glad were gonna try it out.
 Yeah. Were cool.
 Whats under your shirt?
  Hello?
 Im good.
 This is embarrassing, Michael.
 Let me put my shoes on.
 Im not mad. Are you mad?
 Well, Im sorry if it seems that way to you.
 Mike.
 You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So Im not apologizing.
 Thats it.
 Yes.
 No.
 Youre gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
 You said no to this one!
 What have you done for me?
 What have you done for me?
 Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All youve ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
 I dont understand the point of a hat.
 Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
 Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
 This was your freshman year.
 No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
 We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
 I agree. I think its superb.
 Hey Andy.
 You gotta stop texting me so much.
 You need to change your standard for whats worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
 No.
 There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And theyd all say the same thing. "Im coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty.
  "Are you watching this?" Seriously?
 Im sitting right here.
  Megan Fox. Question mark. Whats that mean?
 You know what, youre one bad text away from getting blocked.
 You accept these terms?
  Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
  Thats a text.
 Thats your new standard.
 Ill take one of those pink pouches.
 I feel good today. My little girl Jada? Its my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things Ive never heard of. iCarly... You know whos funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. Hes got a nice way of talking.
 Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, Ive been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
 She did?
 I dont know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
  Dont come in, Im busy.
 Uh, no.
 No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
 Hey...  You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Lets do it.
  I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think,  oh... pick a damn tree already.
 Jada dont want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasnt as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
 Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess thats something to do.
 How do I do that?
 Are you serious?
 No, he doesnt.  I told her Santa would be here.
 Sure, sweetie.
 Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
 Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and hell tell us if were hot or cold.
 And the games over seconds later.
 What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
 Hey, Mike.
 We wanted to give you something.
 What do you say?
 You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. Theres tons of cuties and its easy to talk to them. Hey, what book is that? Cool, lets hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...
 Ill come with you, show you how its done.
 My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
 I got that cutie behind the counter.
 Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
 Holy , what? Let me see that. Its so light. Like a croissant.
 Hey, howd you do?
 Really?
 Cool.
 A book about oceans.
 No, thats uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
 Whoa! Hold on.
  Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
 Im telling you, dont do it. Ive got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You cant unsee that.
 What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
 Were going skating.
 Sup?
 To the arcade.
 Why, did you meet someone?
 Right on, son.
 Right.
 Ahem!
  Theyre a bunch of jackals.
 They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means youre almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
 Whats it say?
 And I will take you all down.
 Ive been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason me.
 Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
 Wrap it up, Gabe.
 Send me one too.
 You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. Youre a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.
 Dreaming hes a dog on a island.
 Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
 She was about to turn 97.
 Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Lets get wasted." "Have fun today, big guy." "Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop."
 "Hooray. Live it up big D. " "Days like this dont come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this"?

 Rachel from the party?
 Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow!
 Yeah, its a little much.
 Obviously, so happy for them both.
 That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
 Okay. Ill keep working.
 I can hear you.
 You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
 Pick it up.
 Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
 Make that face he likes.
 We should play it.
 Its Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
 Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
 And Im gonna play this here share the wealth card.
 Which entitles me to half of both of yalls money so if you dont mind.
 It was in the box.
 Thank you.
 Dallas indeed.
 I told you were way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
 Yeah where is it?
 Kind of embarassing.
 Its cool that you like the southwest. Its one of my favorite regions.
 Its one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
 I love the desert. Its one of my favorite ecosystems.
 Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
 So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
 Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
 No, Im good. Keep them.
 Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
 Damn that was cold.
||
 Hey.
 Thats sweet Mike. Lets see here. Theres a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
 No. Cant let you do that Mike.
 Seriously?
 Snap, for real?
 The winner under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling."
  Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
 Damn!
 Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
 The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
 Do it!
 Ill take him.
 Whats wrong with you?
 Yeah.
 I was talking like this.  I dont feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
 Nine first.
  Good morning.
  Good morning.
  I did.
  I have a solid relationship with Jo, the companys owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesnt hurt that Im...  bla-aaack!
   Thank you.
  Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.
  Uh...  yes?! I was.  Little joke!
  I thought that was your job.
  Ill answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions.
   Whos that?
  I... I just thought you knew me.
  Let me...  Oh. Cool.
   Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was...  Clippy.
  So, uh... here you go.
  Hope its all right.
  The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, howd he do?
  Ehh, thats not who Im talking about.
  Yes. How did he do?
  Come on man. Im being serious. Dont joke.
  Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
  Paper material, maam.
   Pieces of paper.
   Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing?  Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didnt disrupt your meeting.
   Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
  Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Lets go.
  Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
