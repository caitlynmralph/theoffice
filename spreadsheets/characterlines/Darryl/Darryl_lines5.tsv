 Whats up, Mike?
 You a baby daddy?
 Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
 You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy."
 Because youre not a daddy, and its not your baby.
 You feel connected to his baby over there?
 You feel connected to this?
 You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
 No.
 Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
 Hey Mike, do my thing.
 Mike, you cant do that. Its conflict of interest.

 She thought I was McNabb.

 Four hours. Almost halfway there.

  Theres another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
 This is the last of it.
 Youre not staying?
 But you want me to put it back in the truck.

 Something wrong with the doll?
 Mike claims, were all a family isnt that right?
 Ok, so um, whats his name? All the way in the back there.

 I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
