 Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
 This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
 Go, Dwight Jr!
 Congratulations, baby!
  You got this, Roy.
 Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erins confidence.
 Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought Id be into The Godfather cause Im black. Wrong! Im into The Godfather cause Im a cinephile. I like Scarface cause Im black.
 OK, um, I like Erins hair. Its a very pretty color.
 Um, where did you get that story?
 That was a good one.
 Its getting late. I thought you guys could use a little  inspiration.
 127 hours. Its about this guy who-
 My bad.
 Goodnight.
 Oh, ok.
 Its all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
 Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, Ive been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Lets knock out a few more of these sound bites while were here.  Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
 You log in sales at ten different times. If you log â€˜em all at once, you save a lot of time. Its called batching.
 Life hacking, man.
 Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
 What?! Really?
  Huh ha! Thats cool, man.
 Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
 That was a triple.
 My pleasure.
  Hey, if you dont want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
 Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
 Youre the tutorial.

  What are you doing?
 You popped one kernel.

 Too late.
 You went to Cornell?
 I cant really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
 Get under your chin first. Yeah.
 Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
 Yeah, thats crazy.
 Who?
 Sounds great.
 If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
 I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
 I would if I owned it and I went broke.
 Andy, its Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
 Hes been sailing for two days.
 Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
  What are yall doing?
 Cool. It should be taller though, right?
 Thats what Im talkin about.
 Bang.
 Well, yeah, what can I say, a players gotta play.
 Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But Im gonna let them think the other thing.
  Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
 So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
 Think that through for a sec.
 Yeah, Jims going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I havent heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
 What else could you possibly be forgetting?
 Things? People?
 Merediths a little cute. Im just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
 Im gonna tell Jim to go  himself.
 Sucks. Anyway, I just dont see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
 Alright. I mean, its what you want, so...
 I know, I know. Its just hard.
 Me and Val were going nowhere and if Im gonna be working in Philly, Im gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Heres how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like its a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
 Ill never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
 Alright, were going down to my warehouse, that means were playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
 Yeah, she ended things.
 Thanks, man.
 Oh, hey Val.
 Yeah.
 When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasnt feeling good. Shes not around to do that anymore. Im sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
 Huh?
 Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I dont want to force you into something you dont want to do.
 But...
 Im back together with Val. Yay...
 Heading to Philly. Interview with Jims company.
 Why dont you come along and tell him yourself?
 I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andys job in the bag until my interview.
 Yeah, I guess
 Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
 If this companys going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
 Yeah.
 â€œMandateâ€- Always think of two men on a date.  I have gay friends I have one gay friend.  Oscar?
  Ummm  Alright. Obviously yall look really busy, and uh, I dont want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh Obviously Im not qualified to be here man, Im  Im a warehouse manager, you know
 Cool. Hey, thanks
 Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh  I wrote some down. There you go.  Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me!
 Yeah, yeah me too. I think itd be like You know what?  I think itd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot Perfecto!  Oh my god
 So Im like a three year old girl in this scenario
 And Id only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, Im Im not so sure Id like living in Philadelphia.
 Who needs it?
 What?  How about yesterday?
 Oh, thank you.
 Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
 Kill their fish, and they still hire me. Thats how you do that, baby. Its all good, Im ready. Yall ready for this?
 Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. Thats why Im doing it.
 Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, Im switching over.
 Yep.
 Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. Im getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
 Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. Its very unlikely it would happen again.
 Loyalty.
 Darryl is dating Val... still.
 Dwight, look, Im sorry youre having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
 It can.
 I dont do that anymore.
||
 All right, lets get this over with.
 How far is this place?
 Fun.
 They have fast food in Philly.
 Exactly like this.
 Its 30 degrees out. You drinkin a mildshake?
 You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
 You missed a spot.
||
 No. I was clearing my throat.
||
 And replay.
  Im gonna miss the paper business.
 They smell so bad.
 Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
 They smell so bad.
 Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
 How much did you pay for that?
 Everybody knows I go to Philly. Ive just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
 Hey.
 Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
 Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
 Which usually means theres clothes all over the living room.
 I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. Its just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesnt wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job.
 Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
 Yes sir.
 You too... Darryl.
 Its cool. Readings tricky sometimes.
 Thats my go-to thermos. Thats all.
 No big deal. No big deal.
 Nah, nah...
  Nah, nah, nah. You dont have to do that.
 I dont know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
 Thank you.
 Oh, hey.
 I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. Its cool?
 All right.
 I didnt say anything.
 Excuse me?
 What you need flour for, Jim?
 What? You making bread?
 What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
 All right, Im being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. Thats all.
 We good.
 Nothing.  Its mine.   What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
 Hes not my hire, but I know who he is.
 What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
 I know he loves his pick up truck.
 Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husbands like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
  Oh. Come on!
 Damn!
 That felt really good, actually.
 No... yes, yes. Why wouldnt I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
  Stop talking bout it. I said Im fine with it.
 Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And were taking our business elsewhere.
 Man, you cant do that stuff. Youll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
 Hey, Andy.
 Youve got a booger bubble going on there.
 Its ok.
 Dont use his real name. George Howard Scubb. Its a devil name.
 Thats big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
 Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her its not OK to do this in public.
 Hey, man. Darryl.
 And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
 Subway sandwiches.
 The space dust does it.
 Yeah.
 Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
 Yeah, Jim.
 Its so strong.
 We can look into it.
 Well go after Darth then.
 Thats what we gotta do.
 It does not say dangerous. And theres no exclamation point.
 Something full of acid.
  That was great man. Alright, Im out of here.
 Yep.
 I was in The Whiz in high school.
 Hold up, Im looking at my spit with a microscope.
 So?
 Andy Bernard cant squirt water in his eye and act like it doesnt freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
 I believe I want to go home.
 Action!
 I just think youre going into this a little fast.
 Show business is cold. Lets say you get a job, which you probably wont. Theyre not gonna cut you any slack. Youre meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
 You talk to Wade and Colin?
 We got an offer on the table.
 A buyout.
 Were in play, baby.
 We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure its not just a Philly play, so get this theyre gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
 Yeah, we did it.
 Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
 Cant do what?
 No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
 What up?
 Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows Im here.
 I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
 Thanks, man.
 Yep. Take care.
 Hey.
 No, no, Im not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didnt say goodbye to.
 We livin like rock stars. Im about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
 Jim really doesnt want to come?
 Wow. Man. I hope he doesnt regret it.
 Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
 If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
 Oh, hey. Hey, whats up, yall?
 Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
 I dont think I sh-
 Guess Im going upstairs.
 I didnt realize we were this close.
 Uh yeah. Depending on traffic.
 These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
 Well, its been great.
 Maybe forever. Anyhowâ€”
 Oh, oh, Im sure we did.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and thats on me. But Im not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause youre feeling sentimental.
 Hey, hey, hey. Ill do one thing with yall.
 I dont care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
 You chose one thing?
 You want to dance?
 This is what you want?
 Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause were gonna do this right.
 I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. Im gonna miss these guys.
 Hello, hello.
 Hey, whats up?
 What? Mustve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
 Hey, man. How are you doing? I, umI didnt call â€˜cause I figured you changed the number.
 Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
 You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
 Hey, Pam! How are you?
 I love it. And its Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
 Yeah. Yeah, its hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos arefor real.
 Woah-Oh! Havent been in one of these in forever.
 That happens a lot?
 Lets get a drink in you, huh?
 Right there.
 Thank you go much.
 Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame.  No offense. You going, Toby?
 What? All right!
 Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
 You did good. Real good.
 Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
