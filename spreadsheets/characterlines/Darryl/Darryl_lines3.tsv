 Hey Mike.
 Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
 I wasnt.
 Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So hes keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
 Hang on little ladies. You dont need this thing, Ill go grab my synthesizer.
 Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your...  meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. Were having a party.
 All right. Se you later...
 All right, whats up Mike?
 Yup.
 Uh huh.
 Yup.
 Mike, Im very busy down here.
 Oh, yes! Yes! Whatd I tell you? I knew hed turn up  You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
 You ready for me?
 Cool.
 Okay.
 Okay, Ill start.  Its pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  Im scheduled to get one in six months, but Id like that to be moved up to now.
 Are you wearin lady clothes?
 Are you wearin lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
 That theres a womans suit.
 Ima call Roy, man.
 This is gonna make him feel better.
 This is too good.
 Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
 Okay, can you just stand right there?   I gotta send some e-mails.
 Well, its simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now were shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And Im pickin up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin a raise.
 What?  I cant hear you.
 I cant--- what, Mike?  Are you---
 Why cant I just... tell you?
 There you go.
 I am serious, Mike.  Thats a 10% raise.  Thats what I want.
 Come on, be for real Mike.
  Are you serious?  Youre earning this?
 Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog.
 Ho-ho!
 Oh, Im sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.   Ah.
  Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.    Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.
 What?
 Thats cause of you, Mike.  Theyre not gonna give the workin man more than the boss.
 Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
 Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
 Yeah thats true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
 Yeah, you should.
 Fourteen years long.
 Make it happen, capin.
 Comfortable, Mike?
 How about you, man.  Comfortable?
 Thank you.
 I havent been to New York in a long time.
 Maybe Ill stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
 Oh you could stay too.  Hes got a big place.
 Mm, its not that big.
 Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
 Okay, bring it home now.  And dont forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
 Yes sir.  Remember that.  Ill be right outside if you need me
 Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just cant help myself.
 Now, this is the forklift.  You need---  You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
 We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... Weve never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
 And I fell and busted my ankle.  Im legitimately scared for my workers.
 The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
 How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
 Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
 Anybody?
 Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
  You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
 These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
 Take them at the same time.
 Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
 Actually, you did.
 Alright, we outta here.
 Thats what Ive been trying to tell you, Mike.  Its serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin on your biscuit.  Never havin to risk it.
 Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, youre gonna serious hurt yourself.
 Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
 A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  Its goin good, right?
 Mike, youre a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
