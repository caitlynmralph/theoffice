 Hey lets go to Poor Richards.
 Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
 Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Whered you get em? Like Queers R Us?
 Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you dont have a lot of business to start with.
  I think he feels bad.
 Hiding from his momma.
 Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! Thats that girl from that thing.  I banged this girl right here. This is...
 Yes, this is the one.
 You remember? Yes!
 Yes!   Right here. You are a naughty girl!
 Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, Ive seen Santa.
 Who cares?
 Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else Im done.
 I had to. I needed defense.
 Its defense.
 It is worth it.
 Are you kidding? You wait.
 Thats okay, Mike.
 All right. Thanks, man.
 How about the sales department is the sails?
 What?
 Thats what Im talking about!
  What... Whats that?  Whatcha doing?
 That was definitely not dancing.
 Paper business.
 My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
 Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
 The experience...
 Its dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
 Mike.
 Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
 Look, would ya... look.
 Were the ones that got to clean that up!
 My priority is safety.
 So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
 Uh uh uh. Dont shush me.
 That bothers me too.
 I hate that too.
 No, you dont. You dont feel us. How can you? You know what?
 You say were the same, but we get compensated very differently.
 We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
 But we get paid a lot less.
 You know this would not happen if we had a union.
 Thats what we need.
 Man, see... Thats what Ive been sayin, man. We need to do this finally.
 Its more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworkers Union?
 Man, hook you up.
 Union! Union, yeah.
 Are you with us Mike?
 Welcome to the warehouse.
 This is not a good idea right here.
 Hey Michael. This aint over.
 Checkin in with Chet. Dopplers up.
 Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
 Except my warehouse.
 We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
 What?
 Why? Cause Im from the hood?
  Dinkin flicka.
 I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin flicka." You know, things us Negroes say.
 Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
