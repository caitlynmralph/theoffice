   I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, Im on the ground and the ladders on top of me.
   Yes.
   This doesnt concern you man, you need to walk away.
   If we were living in Sweden, I wouldnt have to worry about this cause wed have universal healthcare.
   Be quiet.
   Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
   Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
   You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
   Why would you think a lady is me?
   Heres what Im gonna do, Im calling corporate and Im filing a complaint against both of you.
   Cmon Gwenneth.
   Cool.
   Stupidest thing Ive ever heard.
   Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
   And Im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
 This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You dont believe me? Just take a look.  Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
 Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
 Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
 I asked for a list.  ...and a clown.
 Youre not as scary as Book Face, over there.
 Ok, kids. Youve all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 Theres other pencils in this office.
 Michael.
 I know who did that.
 Didnt have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
 Yes. All of em. Together. Its a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
 You need to get back on top.
 Yeah.
 That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
 I cant. You know that.
Hey, whats up?
Thanks, its cool. So...
Has that ever happened? Ever?
You want me to invite Matt?
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Happy hour. My pleasure.
So, the guy shows me the deck hes built. And Im like, Ill call this a deck if itll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.  It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dudes life story? Its amazing, right?
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matts an okay dude, but hes a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Tell em your story, Hide.
 I brought those in. Its my birthday.  Thats some stone-cold narcissism right there.
 Thank you.
  Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
 Sounds all right.
 I didnt say "aight."
 I like the sound of this.  Maybe one day Ill be sitting in Michaels chair. Wouldnt that be something?
 I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
 Curl up with your favorite DVD.
  Wow. That dude is good.
 You didnt feel like he was hiding something?
 Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
 Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. Hes a fool. Theres gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."
 Close the door.
 I dont have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. Its like jazz.  Andy dont mess with me.  Ill figure something out.
 Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
 It was kind of mumbled, I dont know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy," "Problem," "Eliminate," something. I dont know what it meant.
 Whoa. I hadnt even thought of that.
 Look, Im not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
 Glen, could you excuse us?
 Its bad.
 Its real bad.
 Still no plan.
 Its getting bigger.
 I can videotape it.
  There it is.
 What?
 You havent even introduced yourself.
 You should talk in a higher voice cause the camera makes you sound weird.
 Higher.
 Mm-hmm
 One more, yeah.
 This...
 I dont wanna prank anymore. Things get real. Its not funny. Im just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
  Probably shouldnt tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
  A restful location. Talk to Glen. Hell take you up in the lift.
  Lightbulbs burnt out, so its dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when Im trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesnt exist, okay?
  Pam.
 Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
 I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... shes the copy editor at the Trib.
 No.
 All right, this is just messed up.
 All right.
 Michael, you know you dont have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
