 Hey, get off.
 I have plans later.
 I have my daughter tonight; were renting Charlottes Web.
 My daughter.
 That was cold.
 Hey, lets call this what it is.
 Its like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  Its gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
 Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, whats not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this things run its course.
 Slow down, think it over.

  Out of paper, out of stock, theres friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
 Dunder Mifflin.

 Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
 Thats when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
 Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon youre laughing and hugging. Before you know it, youve forgotten the whole thing. Yall can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
 Well, its effective.
 Hey, are we doing this thing?
  Like what?
 Figured I look presentable.  You?  Went a different way.
 What college did you go to Mike?
