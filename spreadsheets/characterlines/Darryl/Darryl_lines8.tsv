 Im lifting.
 Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin much better. This soda. This is mine.
 Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
 Good times.
 Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
 Its ok E-Dog, just who called?
 No no no no.  I like her.
 Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
 Ill introduce you.
 Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I cant tell you what I did with my ex wife last night. I have to sing it.   We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
  rub a dub dubI got scrubbed.  â€˜Sup, darlin? Everybody, this is Justine.  This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
 Follow me, I got a space. After you.  Ive been thinking about you all mornin.  I dont know what you did, I can barely walk today.
 A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
 Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
  Hello?....Justine!  Nice surprise! How you doin baby?....Nah. No no, I didnt win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. Thatll be-...What?....Oh, his numbers in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right-  Whoops.
 When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won  playing my birthday.
 I dont know.
 No.
 I havent hired anyone.
 Im not checkin email till lunch. Four hour work week.
 I got it. Im doin it.
 When did I get so fat?
 I didnt hire anyone if thats why youre here.
 I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of em. So Id say were in the early stages of the process.
 The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
 I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You cant air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
 You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
 Oh yeah.
 One of em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals.
 I dont
 Nope. Im good. Im here. Lets find some warehouse workers.
 OK.
OK.
 Yeah.
 Why do you wanna work here?
 Thats not a good reason.
 Dont just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, its ten years later and youre still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, its not gonna change.
 I hope so. Think about this carefully. Theres better lives than this one.
 Ive never been lucky. And Im not talkin about the lottery, Im talkin bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
 Did you hire em?
 What do you mean â€œthey leftâ€?
 Then I think you should fire me.
 Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
 No? OK. I dont wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
 Would you just fire me, man?
 You wanna make me happy? Huh?
 Give me your job.
 Ill do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
 He died.
 I didnt have time because of my daughter.
 Hey Im not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
 OK.
 OK, dont fire me.
 My futures not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. Its gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
 I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, its gonna be mostly my bunch.
 Why is the forklift in the wall?
 Is that grease on my floor?
 And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
 And?
 Let me see it.
 Let me see it!
 What happens when were done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
 Theres a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
 Ive seen this, thats not you.
 Yeah, Ill say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California!
 I think if I had parents like that Id be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
 Rosebud?
 I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didnt explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
 No. Youre wrong.
 Cheeseburger or hamburger.
 He gets condescending when hes nervous. Or when hes excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
 Put it on, man.
 Three Kings.
 This partys tight.  The fog is cool.
 Perfect.
 I just dont get it, Pam. I mean, youre a rational person.
 Dwight?
 Dwight.
 Dwight!
 [in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
 Nahh!  No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
 Oh yeah.
 AhhWe dont really do those. We just sign the thing.
 Ill be there.
 Its not a race.
 Who knows what the belt is for?
 Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
 All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesnt get much use nowadays.
 You done?
 Once you read the packet, sign the back.
 Actually, Val, why dont you come with? Ill need the extra hands to carry them back.
 Mmhmm.  Caramel soy latte.
 Got it.
 Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle thats just Lab?
 Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
 What are you doing here, Gabe?
Its Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
 Dude.
 Look man this is a bad idea.
 Really? That is messed up man.
 Youre a bad man Andy Bernard.
 That stuff can come back to get you. Its called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle
 What are you doing with my lunch?
 Its not pizza.
 I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
 Nice scatting, man.
 That was never agreed upon.
 Again, never agreed upon.
 Usually that life is short and tragic. Thats okay, right?
 Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
 Hey, why dont you and me play those?
 Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
  Hey, you caught some of that?
 What, you dont like the blues?
 Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
 Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didnt really fit in with our thing.
 No man, we are.
 No, no, no.
 Every day.
 You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
 J-j-j-ju...
 Shh! Movies almost over.
 I got Source Code on the way back.
 Thats fascinating. Tell me, whats the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
 Hunger for hamburger.
 Thats good.
 Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
 Hey.
 Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
 I hate myself.
 Hey, Devils Den is that way, we should check it out. Thats where the snipers hid.
 Ill come with you.
 Hey man.
 Taking a load off huh?
 Good luck with that.
 You dont have to say it if youre doing it.
 Uh weight lifting yeah.
 Ill take a look.
 Ive been meaning to join a gym.  For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didnt realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
 Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
 Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know Im not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
 Make a real gym.
 Getting my sweat on.
 I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
 No.
 Dude, Im gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure Ill start slow.
 Its Lejon Brames.
 You know, get it right.
 Yeah, Im gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
 Okay, Im not doing that.
 Looks that way.
 This doesnt help me. I dont respond to that kind of strategy.
 Dwight, come back and spot me.
 To push this bar up.
 Help me!
 To look good for Val!
 This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
 Alright.
 Oh yeah, and um theres a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
 Popsicles?
 Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus its fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
 Oh, its nice, its real nice. People get dressed up.
 I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
 I thought youd wear a sweater.
 Come on, stay, alright? Its good for people to get to know you.
 Hi.
 Im in.
 Its trivia.
 Thats a great plan.
 You just made a good idea, a great idea.
 What?
 There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. Thats the thing about long drives, you know, youre always going to- this is a gay bar.
 Yes, Shawn Marion.
 Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
 Yeah, were going to get clobbered.
 Val. You made it.
 Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
 Mmm.
  You know, I dont think Ive ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
 Yeah, sure, sure. Ill be right in.
 Ive been working out. But, the problem is, Ive been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasnt burned off yet. Awkward stage.
 Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water youve been drinking.
 Cool.
 Cannonball!  Lets do this!
 Nice.
 Why?
 Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
 Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
 Its all good, we got this.
 I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So youre just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
 Eat it.
 Eat. It.
 Correction we dont care.
 You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
 So if I started singing â€œDown By the Old Mill Streamâ€, you couldnt join me in a three part harmony.  Down by the, down by the, down by the....
  Old, mill, stream.
 Mm hmm.
 What do we have here?
 Val knit me a beanie. But I cant if its a â€œwere just friendsâ€ beanie or a â€œIm hot, youre hot, lets get it poppinâ€ beanie. So Im gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and well get to the meaning of the beanie.
  Notice anything different about me?
 Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
  Wow. Its like the nation of Islam down here.
 Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 No, no, no. Maybe just later.
 Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
  This is Darryl.
 Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
 Were friends. Were friends.
 Yeah sorry, Im just looking for a pen.
 Back off! I got my reasons.
 Hey whats up? You called?
 Its cool really.
 â€œThis coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attackâ€
 Thanks.  Nice flowers.
 Your mom?
 Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
 She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your moms name is Brandon?
 Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
 I loved it.
 Oh  yeah.
 Yes sir. Thanks.
 Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasnt real, cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you wont want to do her. Shes a dog.
 Processed.
 Whats up man? Im Darryl.
 Oh yeah.
 Im not sleeping with your girlfriend.
 "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" "Getting my fry on."
 Uh, "The moon is huge tonight."
 Thats regular text talk.
 "Youre such a great friend."
 "Youre such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."
 Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. Im stranded on shutter island over here.
 Shes got a boyfriend.
 It has been processed.
 Sure.
 Hey, just so you know, me and you I dont think thats ridiculous Dot, dot, dot dot, dot.
 Andy, who punched you?
 Guys, guys. Thats so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
 What?
 Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
  Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
 Ill put you down for shortbreads.
 No. No.
 I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
 You know what? Its your first time, lets split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I dont know Ill just take, uh, accounting.
 OK, great.
  All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some.  When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
  Would you like to buy some cookies?
  Its not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
 Youre new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
 That doesnt mean anything.  Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
  Huh. Hit the road, jack.
  Whats a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You cant trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
 Thank you.
  Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my  chubby daughter?
 Baby, if youre watching this, youre not chubby, youre beautiful. Daddys just got to sell some cookies. And were also gonna exercise more. Its gonna be fun.
 No, no, no, no. Its not worth it.
 Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
 Youre not talking... triple digits?
  Hi. This is Alex.
  Kevin cant come to the phone right now because hes busy with us.
 I dont know, man, they might think were drag queens.
 Forget it, man.
 Im out. And so is Toby.
 This may be wrong. But theres a limit to what I would do for my child.
  Hey, hey. Theyre back.
 I was still thinking of going back to school.
 Me.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
 So how was the drive in?
 You dont say?
 Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
 Uh... I have other issues. Im terrible at math. Overweight. You- youre in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
 He does not like that wall.
 Looking good, RC!
 You really re-did Andys office, huh?
 I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
 You could go downstairs and ask them?
 Who knew, right?
 Tacos.
 I can go get us some tacos.
 If you loan me some money.
 $30.
 Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
 Hmhmm.
 Shes trying.
 Peppers been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
 Is she sick? How are her poops?
 Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
 You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
 And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
 Aw, come on. Whats the harm?  Mmm. What flavor was that?
 The coconuts pretty subtle.
 I dont know, man. Yall quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, yall came up in here dancing and everybody was-  ooh, hold on a second.  Oh.
 If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldnt give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
 A lot has changed since yall left, okay? Youre gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now shes one of the best weve ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
 I would.
 Yeah.
 Yes, I am. Just so everyones on the same page.
 Good slam.
 Good luck to you.
  Lets see that smile. Go on.
 Cool.
