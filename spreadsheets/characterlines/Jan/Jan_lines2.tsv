  Its a, its, its a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
 No.
 No, we dont approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... were not paying for this.
 Are you there Michael?
 Really? Im dropping an atomic bomb on you?
 You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
 And you had a luau....
 And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
 Okay, well, I dont understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesnt even make sense.
  Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then.  Hi.
 You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. Whats the problem?
 Well, that... thats true in a way. You cant say anything.
 Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
 Michael. MICHAEL!
 Michael, please.
 Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
 Thats not my sense of humor.
 Wha...
  Scuse me, Im sorry.  Michael. Mr. OMalley is your lawyer.
 Mr. OMalley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
 This is a projection of the countys needs...
 Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
 So when we get to the Radisson, Id like to, um-
 Excuse me?
 You had no right to do that, Michael.
 It said that.
 Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
 What?
 Thank you.
 Michael, shouldnt take more than an hour.
 Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
 So which way is Chilis?
 Oh, no, thats alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
 I know Scranton.
 Alright.
 If its a couple blocks away-
 Ok.
 Why would we need a signal?
 What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
 Youre gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
 Just Jan Levinson.
 No.  Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
 Michael.
 Michael, we got divorced, ok?  Im so sorry.  Excuse me.
 Michael.  Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
 Were in a meeting.
 Christian.
 I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
 What?
 So-
 If you have a-
 Christian, you dont have to listen to this.
 Just the one.
   Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
 We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just cant match.
 Whats the bottom line?
 I dont think Christian has time for that.
 Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
 Wed been fighting for a while-
 He didnt want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
 I was stupid.
 Uh-
 Bye... thanks.  Yes!
 We got it!
 I am really-  Thrilled.  Lets go.
 Lets go.
 Michael.
 I am returning your many calls.
 No. No, we wont be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
 Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
 I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
 Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
 Michael.
 Are the cameras with you...
 ...in your office?
   Well address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye.   Could you please tell Michael that Im here?
 Im good; how are you?
 Nice to see you.
 Can we please go in your office?
 Thank you.
 Nice to see you too, Michael.
 Not like that.
 You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  Im not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
 Period.
 Do we understand each other.
 So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
 No.
 Fine.
 How is that a business question?
 Please dont smell me, Michael.
 Uh, Id like to sit in on that meeting  is it happening right now?
 Great.  Very good.
 That sounds serious, Michael.
 I cant, I cant-
 Please sit down.
 Youre gonna sit here and Im gonna go sit over there.
 Please, sit yourself down.
 What, Michael.
 Because nothing did, Michael.  It, Im not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
 No, Dwight; come in.
 Is this how youve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
 Thats a serious offense!
 Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
 No.
 Ok! Heres what Im gonna do Im gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
  Thank you, Dwight.
 Look, I know its your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, Im not gonna discuss it with him, Im certainly not gonna discuss it with you.   Do you have a light?
 Im heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
 K?
 Michael, now is not the time or the place.
 No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
 Never, for me, always means never ever ever.
 Michael, it has nothing-
 With your looks, ok?  Its your personality.  I mean, youre obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I dont agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
 Really.  Youre, youre, youre a great guy, ok?
 And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
 At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where Im looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
 Ohhh, God.
 So, Im happy to be here.  Its very nice to see all of you. Youre all looking well.
 Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
 Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldnt be here.
 What are you doing?
 Michael.
 Michael.
 You are not allowed in this session.
 Now youre really not allowed in this session.
 Im your boss.
 Were fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
 Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
 Yes, Pam?
 Michael!
  So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. Theyre called... anyone?
 I dont know what youre doing here, Michael,
 ... but its very destructive.
 Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
 Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
 Im so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
 Please? Thank you. very much.
 Why dont we go around the table and all say something that we know were good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
 Great. Phyllis?
 No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
 That is an excellent goal.
 Great! Uh-huh?
 Well, Ill be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if theres any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
 Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
 You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
 Well, its only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but Im sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
 There are always a million reasons not to do something.
 All right. Lets talk about clothing.
 Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
 Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. Im sure that all of you have felt that before...
 What? A union! What...
 Im not...
 The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
 You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
 Thats too bad.
 I dont want to...
 Michael! Michael! Michael!
 Michael.
 Dont say another word.
 Get yourself down stairs.
 Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
 Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesnt make sense.
 Excuse me?
 I dont know what Michael was talking about. I dont know.
  Kelly, I dont know what Michaels talking about.
 Im divorced.
 It was. Yes.
 I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
 Okay. Lets take five. I think we can all use five.
 Did you take care of the situation?
 Excuse me.
 Excuse me. Ive been told theres been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
 Josh Porter, Stamford.
 And Michael Scott, Scranton.
 Fine Michael. Thank you.
 Nervous, no Im not nervous. Well, I guess Id be lying if I didnt say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, Im very nervous.
 OK.  Craig,
 Um, Im sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
 Craig, you realize that were trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
 Well, the point is, is that doesnt exactly bode well for your branch.
 NO, NO Im not, Im not, I just... I just dont know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, were all gonna get fired.
 Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  cant believe that you told everybody and we didnt even sleep together.
 Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, Its over. Do you understand?
 Surely, you cannot be serious?
 Uh, thats fine. Lets just forget it.
 Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
 Oh, no, its OK.  So, uh, Happy valentines Day.
 Oh.
 Hello, Michael.
 Im... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
 Well, todays not my birthday, so...
 ...Happy birthday, Michael.
 Am I on camera?
  Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
 Michael?
 You know that Im very serious here.
 What?
 I thought that you were their fearless leader.
  I think you can handle it.
 I think so, Michael...
 Goodbye, Michael.
 Michael?
 You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
 I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
 Incidentally, what is the charity?
 Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
 Bye-bye.
 Michael?
 Hi.
 What are you... Just... Wait, whatre you talking about?
 No. No, you didnt. Hi, Im Jan. Im Michaels boss.
 Does anyone want a drink?
 Okay.
 Cosmopolitan, please.
 Well, its part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
 Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
 Oh, me too. Me too.
 What?
 No, I...
 I didnt... I dont know...
 Smoke?
 Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
 Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
 Why did I hook up with Michael?
 It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
 Good. Have you told anyone?
 Well, you should.
 Hey. Im leaving.
 So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
 And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
 Nice to meet you.
 And you guys have a good time together.
 Yeah.
