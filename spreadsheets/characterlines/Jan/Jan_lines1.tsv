  Just before lunch. That would be great.
 Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
 What? Im sorry?
 Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
 Do you want to look at mine?
 OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we cant justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
 Michael, dont panic.
  No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Dont panic. We havent made... We havent decided.
 Ive spoken to Josh in Stamford. Ive told him the same as you and its up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
 This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
 Go ahead.
 So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I dont want to worry people unnecessarily.
 So, which health plan have you decided on?
 Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
 The Gold Plan? Im not even on that plan.
 Michael.
 You know the whole reason that were doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
 Its your job. So...
 Michael... maybe... I mean...
 Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
 Im doing it right now. To you.
 Hello?
 This is Jan.
 Who is this?
 From sales?
 Wheres Michael Scott?
 Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
 Really?
 OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
 No. Please dont use my cell phone ever again.
 Are you listening to me Michael?
 What did I just say?
 Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
 Im not going to do that Michael.
 Weve created an incentive program to increase sales.
 At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
 Uh, yes. Yes you can.
 No, Michael. No. You cant win this prize.
