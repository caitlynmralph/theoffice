 Wheres Wallace?
 I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
 Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
 Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
 I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
 Stop.
 Stop that.
 No, I do.
 Insightful, Pam.
 Pam?
 Im a very busy woman, so...
 Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
  Mommy, youre a princess. Mommy, youre a superstar. Mommy youre the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
 Aw.
  Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
 Cece cant spell her name.
 Well, its not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, â€œCeceâ€ is two letters and â€œAstridâ€ is... I mean, theres even some adults who -- who -- who cant spell it.
 Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
 Dont patronize me.
 No.
 I -- I --
 I dont recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
 Will you uh,  you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
  Do you have a valid passport?
  Hello?
 Oh, Andy.
 Really?
 Hmm.
 Seriously? Youre calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what youre doing?
 Yeah.
 You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
 Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
