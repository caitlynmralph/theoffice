  I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
  Hi.
  Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
  Oh, they found her?
  Thats his ex.
 Hi, Jim!
 This is my baby.
 Astrid.
 Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
 And the birth instructor thought it wasnt a good idea for you to be there, so...
 OK, you dont have any idea what Ive been through, so, lets...
 Im sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
 Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
 trid.
 Well...
 Michael, Michael, Michael, thats... yeah... thats too high.  Ill take that.
 Thank you.  Thats very sweet of you.
 Thank you.
  Being good isnt always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / Hed come and tell me everything is all right / Hed kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
  How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that hes all mine / Learning from each others knowing / Looking to see how much weve grown / And the only one...
 Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
 Yeah, its a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
 Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
 Oh no, its actually really hygienic, Creed.
 And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
 Youre sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
 All right.  Um, Im just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  Im exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrids 529.  Wake me in twenty.
  Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
 Wheres Astrid?
 On a what?
  Thats funny.
 What are you doing? Whats going on? Excuse me.
  There you are.
 You dont flash around a newborn baby.  Dont you know that?
 Michael, I need your help.
 Uh... come on.
 Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
 You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
 Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
 OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
 Dont date Holly.
 Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And Ill see you... soon.
 OK.
