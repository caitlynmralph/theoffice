 You know, its amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
 Thats not what its called.
 Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
 NO!
 No, its not possible.
 You know, imagine... you were gay.
 Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
 Oh, hey!
 We all checked in?
 Great, lets dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
 Okay!
 What are you talking about?
 Step away from me, Michael.
 Great!
 What have you generated, Michael?
 What party?
 Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I cant stay on top of you 24/7.
 Really?
 Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
  Hello?
 Hello?
 How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
 Magically?
 No.
  Hello?
 Who is this?
 You should talk to Michael, and hell talk to me, and that way we dont have to speak to each other.
 What about him?
 Its not about a surprise party is it?
 Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, Im not coming back.
 How do you know I like that store?
 How do you know that?
 No its not.  Its officially not.
 Yeah.
 Really?
 Ok.
 What would you do differently?
 Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michaels back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
  Where is it?
  Michael.
 I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
 No, it wasnt.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
  Mm-hmm.
 You cant have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
  So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
 Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
  I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
 Well, what would you suggest?
 Of Ed?
  Im not sure thats realistic.
 No, thats not---
 What the hell are you two talking about?
 You know what, Michael?  Ive really tried with you today...
 ...and I have to get back to work.
 So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
 Goodbye.
 Tell me what you did yesterday.
 Nothing?
 I dont care how your day was Michael.
 Tell me what you did yesterday.
 Hi, Pam.
 Im great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
 Thanks Pam.
 Michael.
 Michael.
 Michael.
 I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
 The board voted last night to close your branch.
 The boards.
 Im very sorry. I dont relish telling you this. Youve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
 A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
 Well, we havent made final decisions about personnel yet. But youre a severance package person.
 Well, its not all about numbers, Michael.
 Its... its about talent.
 Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our companys future.
 Hi.
 Oh, good. Youre both here. Ready to talk logistics?
 So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, youll be his number two.
 Awesome.
 Wha... excuse... why not?
 Today?
 You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
 Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
 Im gonna make some calls.
 So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
 And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
 Yeah.
 Michael.
 Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
  Wheres Michael?
  Wha... whats going on here?
 Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? Im sure there is a better way to do this but Ive drive something like 400 miles today and Im completely exhausted so Im just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
 Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
 Back?
 Uh, we dont know. Probably. A few.
 Michael!
 Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
 Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
 You do?
 What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
 Hes the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
  Mmhmm.
 We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
 When did the check come?
 Okay, thats when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
 Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, Im not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
 ...Okay its someone named Martin Nash.
 Michael?
 Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
 I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
 Very sunny. Familys important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
 Why am I here, Michael?
 In the last year, Ive gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
 I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
 This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I dont know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least thats what Dr. Perry thinks.
 This is the point, OK? Youre wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
 Good, good.
 Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
 Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
 Oh, God.
 Dwights name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I dont know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc."
  Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
 Okay.
 Uh when, when did, when last night?
 You went to a bachelor party at work?
 Im closer to firing you.
 Ill talk to you later.
 Michael?
 Hi.
 Lets just blow this party off.
 Am I on speaker phone?
 Is anybody else in the...
 Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
 Ok. Lets just go to a motel...
 ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
 Still on speaker?
 Are cameras there?
 See you soon.
 Im sure that its catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. Its a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
 You realize this is a legal document that says you cant sue the company.
 Ive never told you that I love you.
 I am taking a calculated risk. Whats the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
 Whats this over the "i"?
 Why is this so hard? Thats what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
 Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
 Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
 From the Scranton Branch.
 David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
 Were good.  Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
 Martini please.
 You ok?
 Its nice.
 I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
 Im sorry. Youre just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
 Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.
 Dont you know what Im doing?
 Shut up.
 Come on.
 What?
 Just let me loosen my dress.
 Michael.
 Slam me up against the wall, right here.
 Oh, please.
 Oh, Im acting inappropriate? Get out.
 Not too good.
 I feel sick.
 No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
 Please dont cry.
 It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
 I didnt mean it. I was...
 Tired. Im tired. And I didnt eat enough. And, and, thats all. That was it.
 Thats all. I didnt mean it. Thats all. Im just saying I didnt mean it.
 Ok.
 Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
  Is Toby there?
 Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
 Thank God.
 All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
 What did I tell you about "yeppers?"
 I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
 Why dont we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
 Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
 Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, were gonna need to have a third party present.
 Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
 No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
 Michael, hes your branchs HR rep...
 ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we dont do it.
 Thank you, Hunter.  Hello.  Come in.   Ah, Okay.
 Thats my new assistant.
 I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
 Hi, Toby.  First---  First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
 Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
 Oh, God.
 Michael---
 Michael---
 Okay, Michael.  Please, why dont we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
 Ok, Toby, how about if you...
 Great.
 Whats wrong with you?
 Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
 No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
 No.  But we can offer you 12.
 Michael!
  Michael, ...
 ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
 Ill give you $200. And if I get up before you, Ill leave it on the dresser.
 $300?
 You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if youre coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
 Michael...  I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldnt stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So...  Im sorry.
 So... were good?
  Oh. Hold on, Im sorry.
 One second. Oh! Its from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
 OK.  "Its me, Michael. Im just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..."
 Oh.
  Michael.
 Uh, how are you?
 Im great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
 I just,  I uh... I dont uh... I, I dont, I dont like the way that we left things.
 Okay.
 Been good.
 Good.
 Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
 After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
 To kinda clear my mind.
 It was.  Yeah, it was good.  I think Ill just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
 Ive made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
 Ohh...
 So...  there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
 I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
 And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
 Thanks.
 Oh, okay.
 Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
 Good luck with your interview.  Bye.
 Hey you!
 How was your interview?
 Yeah?
 Oh.  Ill put in a good word for you.
 What?
 Whats... whats the matter?  What... what happened in there?
 Tell me what?
 You son of a bitch!
 Youre
  Bye Hunter.
 Good luck with your band.
 Dont let them change you, okay?  So long, .
 Oh, God!  I mean, I just dont understand!  Its just
