 OK, name please.
 Youre over 75 years old?
 Theres no prize money.
 So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
 I dont know what your deal is, but hes mine, OK? So hands off.
 Water? Water?  Water babe?
 Michael thats irrational.
 Hi, Pam.
 Is Michael in?
  Hey.
 Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
 Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
 Different salary.  Youll get there, dont worry.
 Thank you, thank you.
 Best decision I ever made.
 You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
 Hey.
 What?
 So, whats Ryan doing here?
 Hes such a snake.
 I hope hes gets hit with an ageism suit.
 Ageism? Companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
 Yes, Michael, they do.

 Yes, Michael, they do.
   My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
  Is it really that important to you?
  Alright.
  Go by yourself.
  Well...
  What? No Michael!
 You do.
 Well, they both go with the carpet Ive ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
 A futons not a sofa.
 I know what a futon is, Michael.
 It costs what it costs.
 We have gone through this.
 Conniving little runt. Put him through.
 So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
 Why? Improv? Why dont you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
 You drive, I had too much wine.
 I didnt go.
 I just didnt!
 How was improv?
  Youre broke?
  Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I dont, I dont get this.  I really dont.  I dont know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I dont know what more to say.
  Yeah, what?
  Okay, where did he go?
  Well, is he coming right back?
  Ill be right there.
 Alright.
 Michael.
 Whats going on?
 Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
 What does that mean?
 Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems wont solve anything.  You know that.
 Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
 Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  Its not that bad.
 Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didnt have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still wont even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
 Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  Thats just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what Im going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, wheres this train taking us?
 Im keeping them. I know you like them. Theyre kind of uncomfortable though.
 Its kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
||
 I dont know, its just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? Its such a...boys club.
 Good.
 And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
 Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
 Remember, it isnt just a pattern, Its a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
 Does this work for you?
 Uh, come on Micheal, thats tacky.
 Four million.
 No, Michael. Oh, come on.
 Stop saying ridiculous things. Hes just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldnt leave anything up to chance or Michaels judgment.
 Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
 All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
 Michael, just relax, okay?
 People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
 Can we just move on to another question?
 Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
 Uh, yes.
 I had to, Im sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
 You keep it under my side of the mattress.
 Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Lets call it even.
 I love you too.
||
 Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
 Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallaces deposition.
 How about Chinese?
 That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
 Fine, fast foods fine.
 Hi.
 How are you?
 Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
 Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
 So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
 Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
 Alright, well, lets go then, I say upstairs.
 Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, were still a work in progress here.
 This is my office.
 Not super exciting.
 And this is my workspace.
 I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, Im sure that youre the same with your doodles.  Smell.
 Uh-huh, Bonfire.
 Men love this one.
 When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
 Just like that.
 So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
  Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
 Shame on you.
 See, he fits perfectly.
 Its pine.
 Really?
 I bet you are.
 It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies."
  Oh, excuse us just a second.
  So glad youre finally able to be here.
 Oh, how thoughtful.
 Aw.
 How bout we do the short tour and then Ill start dinner?
 Oh no no no, its just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
 You know Pam, in Spain they often dont start eating until midnight.
 Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
 Follow me.
 So music, should we turn some music?
 Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
 Well I think hes probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
 Joe Camel!
 Oh!
 Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
 No.
 I was watching Jim.
 No smiling.
 No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
 No rhyming!
  Im so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. Its actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
 Come on, its a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
 You are so right, youre so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
 I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didnt get. Its okay, I dont mind. In fact you know what, girls trip, Angela come on. Girls trip.
  Uh, not even close.
 You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I dont have to tell you Pam.
 Oh well dont tell me that hes really changed since you guys dated.
 Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
 Mmhmm.
 Coming!
 What are you doing here?
 What is he doing here?
 Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
 We saw Wicked.
 I am so sorry that I dont want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Lets have a ing kid.
 I hate my life.
  Im just gonna check on dinner.
  Can you not do that? Its disgusting.
 Oops.
 Hey babe?
 How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
 Ok.
 At least hes an artist.
  AND IM A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DONT HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
 FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
 YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
  AND YOURE HARDLY MY FIRST!
  Michael!  Michael. What are you doing to him?
 Bye Babe!
 Michael? Hello? Michael?
 Well it was good to see you.
 Yeah, so...
 Hello... Michael.
 I...
 No.
 Uh, no.
 I didnt...
 ... touch that.
 Why?
 Yeah, it did...
 ... happen when...
 ... we were together. Thats true. And-but, you... are not... uh, youre not the dad.
 ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
 Yeah.
 I went to a sperm bank.
 Yuh-huh.
 Uh, yeah.
 I know.
 No, no no... its not just any sperm bank. I mean, its really... this is a really, really great place. Its amazing, actually. Im gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. Its... and its-in fact, its right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
 IHop.
 If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, lets let Michael have a shot at one of em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
 Oh, thats really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
 Look, I dont know what youre gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
 Okay.
