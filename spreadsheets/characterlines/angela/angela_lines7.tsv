 I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephews car.
 Michael, do something.
  Thank you.
||
  My place tonight. Wear this.
  Yes. Dont forget the pipe.
 What the hell is happening?
 Listen, I would like you to take me to Andys play tonight.
 No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
 Well, theres a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
 Thank you.
 Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object.
  Ugh! Theres gum on the seat and now its on my work skirt. I have to go change.
 Oh, Dwight, just move.
 Come on, Dwight.
 These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
 That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
 Wheres my car? Come on.
  No, actually, Dwight, I didnt realize how far this walk was, and I-Im exhausted.
 No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but its okay. This can count as one of your times.
 Well, I wont tell if you dont.
 Good night, Dwight.
  Whos this guy by our cars?
 This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
 What?
 Yeah, I can see that.
 So, what happened?
 KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, shes out.
 Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
 This is an amazing prize. I mean, I dont even want to give Pam a compliment, because shes so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
 I dont like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Lets not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
 Jim. Pam.  And the precious bundle of Gods gift to everything.  I wish you both a pleasant day.  And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
 Well, this is intimate.
 You dont know them all?
 Jesus is not your caterer.  But he should be your caterer cause youre a little angel. Why didnt your parents get you a caterer?  They dont think.
  What are you doing?
 What? Kevin!
 Did you think I stole your baby?
 Someone put them in my bag.
 Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
 Are you going?
 I would watch that.
  Outside my car in two minutes.
 What are you doing here?
 Are you authorized to do this?
 Ok, uhm, then tell him that well do this tomorrow night instead.
 Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
 You know what Pam just save it.
 Nosy?
 Hey, Im kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
 No, I meant...
 Mm-Hmm.
 Perfect!
 You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
 Its a new corporate policy.
||
 Where have you been?! Ive been waiting.
 No, I--I think you should make time for it.
 Dwight?
 Sure.
 Probably.
 Mm-Hmm.
 Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place.  Dont laugh at me.
 Oh.
 Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day.
 Thank You.
 You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
 How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
 You never told us to close them.
 Michael do something about this.
  Really?
 Nothing. Should be fun.
 I wouldnt subject Robert to that. Hes a very busy senator.
 I would not expect you to know what its like to date someone in the public arena.
 The senator.
 We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptrollers wife.
 Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. "Angela..."  "over here, Angela..."  "here. Look here!"
 No, dont throw those out!
 We can save that.
 Just stop moving your calves so much while youre talking.
 Maybe Ill bring my boyfriend. Ill invite him.
 I mean, unless theres any chance there could be press at this party.
 Well, I only ask because hes a senator.
 I dont think thats appropriate.
 Yes, he is.
 Its so cold. Even with my coat on.
 No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
 Im so glad you could come.
 Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
 Yes.
 Mmhmm.
 I dont know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
 I am.
 Zip it, Meredith.
 You are. You make your own drink.
 And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, hes helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think theyve really become a pest.
 Yes.
 Good morning.
 The glitter is blinding.
 Yes.
 My boyfriend.
 Ugh.
 Oh, God.
 All right!
 Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
 I dont know if anyone else feels this way and dont get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe Im being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
 Uh-huh.
 No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
 ...but its totally inappropriate.
 No, stop! Just dont.
 God! Kevin!
 Dwight!
 With who?
 No.
  No! Dont!
 Will you marry me?
 Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
 Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
 Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, hes a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. Hes a great person to know.
 Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
 Oh wait, he cant help because that title has no meaning!
 Please.
 Everything.
 Its an experiment.
 The dream team... and Meredith.
 It was just you...
 You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
 Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
 Oh, thats Thomas, Roberts aide.
 Yeah.
 See? This is what happens. You cant let a stray dog into the house.
 Good God...
 No! Im not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we dont really care about your opinion. Youre just a tie-breaker.
 Of course you do, Jim.  Youre a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
 Okay.  Then how about Im the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
 Andy, what are you doing?
 No.
 Amen.
 Thank you.
 Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
 Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
  Four, one, seven, one...
 Seven, two...
 Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
 Nine, eight, five...
 Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
 Two, one...
 God!
   Okay.  How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senators office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
   Thank you.
  Its a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
  Okay. He took me to the replica of Monets Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, cause its so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senators wife?
  Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?
  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.
   Stanley, I wont be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
  I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldnt afford?
  Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
  Hmm.
  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and theres a great, lively debate here, but lets think about-
