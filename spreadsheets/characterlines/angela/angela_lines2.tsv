 No.
 Email forwards.
 I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or youll have bad luck.

 I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
 Im sure.
 I have one, yes.
 I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
 Apparently.
 Okay! Everybody!
 Do not panic!
 Safety partners.
 Do not panic.
 Go in single file lines.
 Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
 Go, lets go.
 Alright, lets go, lets go.
 Come on, youre safety partners!
 Youre safety partners!
 The Bible.
 A Purpose Driven Life.
 No.
 The DaVinci Code!
 I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
 My name is Angela.
 You cant go in yet!
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 You know, I dont know. We put them all up last night.
 Yeah.
 But we dont keep two sets of books.
 Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
 ... that has three people...
 ... doing the work that could be done by two.
 Those arent chips and dip.
 Uh!
 Im just trying to figure out why youre sabotaging things.
 And I made cookies. Same category.
  What about the Halloween party?
 Have you signed the expense reports yet?
 Michael, did you finish yet?
 This is illegal.
 I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
 Dont talk about it.  Office romances are nobodys business but the people involved.
 Sometimes you talk to us real close.
 Well, when you have coffee breath-
 Its hard.
 I know.
 Hi.
 Its ok.
 No.  Are we supposed to?
 Hmm...  Excuse me.
 Im just leaving for the day.
 Charity.  Bake drive.
 No!
 No, Im not.
 I got sap on me.
 Im a vegetarian.
 Guh.
 I think its alright. Jesus drank wine.
 Is there anything were missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
 Well see.
 Fifty.
  Will you help me?
 It sounds mean.
 Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. Hes not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.
 Ill take the poster. Some people like these.
 What is that?
 There should be some ..
 Hey, come inside and talk to me.
 Its alright.
 What is wrong with you?
 Hey!
 He needs to go right now, and youre his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
 I, barely know him...
 Hes out sick.
 I agree its unacceptable.
 This is from Hooters.
 Did Toby approve this?
 Its nobodys business, Phyllis. Roy.
 We havent finished getting things in order from your last visit.
 Were you?
  Really?
 Ive seen some of your spreadsheets.
 Im not gaining anything from this seminar. Im a professional woman. The head of accounting. Im in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think its insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
 Are you married?
 At least you dont have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
 Really? I wouldnt know anything about that, but Im glad you enjoyed it.
 I didnt get anything for Valentines Day.
 Really? Well, I hope I do.
 Nothing for me?
 Are we out of jobs?
 The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
   I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
 Well, Ive seen you take enough for the both of us.
 Can you put that down there?
 No. Thanks. Wed... have to explain everything, its probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
 I guess I wouldnt mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
 You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities .
 One thirty.  Im sorry, are we boring you?
 No. This is a closed door meeting.
 You dont know its going to be okay. Dont give him false hope. ...Its probably nothing, though.
 Bologna? I dont eat bologna.
 No.
 No.
  Oh. Thank you.
 What are--- its... the party planning committee.
 Fine.
 Yes...  but dont expect any cookie.
||
 No one cares about your birthday. Kevins waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
 I understand.
||
 I dont take any prescription drugs.
 No, not at all.
 Do you want to give Michael your urine?
 Youre not going to get my permission on this.
 I didnt get mine yet.
 Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
 Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
 I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
 Thats... no...
 How about, I leave it up?
 But, it...
 Oh. Thanks.
 It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. Its not my taste.
 You already did me.
 Yes, thats the problem.
 What?
 You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
 We are giving money that has been gambled. Why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
 Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
 Then roll an eight.
 Good luck, Dwight.
