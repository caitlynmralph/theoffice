 Look, its a â€˜Little Pregs  and â€˜Big Pregs
 Isnt it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
 I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
 Did you guys figure it out?
 It was excellent.
 Bye.
 Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
 No, hes fine.
 Hes always been like that.
 I mean, hes gotten worse over the years.
 Have you seen this?
 Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
 So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while youre pregnant?
 I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
 Great.
 Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma Im having.
  A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I dont know if I should call social services about it.
 Maybe.
 In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
 I already did.
 Fine.
 Sure.
 Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your babys birth weight pool.
 Yeah. And I said sorry.
 Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
 Ive already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
 Phillip?
 Phillip is the name that were using. Its after my favorite cat.
 Its after my cat.
 I would like to toast someone who isnt here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
 She just always has to copy anything I do! Its the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
 Little Cici asleep?
 Such a precious little angel.
 Cecilia....and Phillip.
 Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesnt even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! Its just something you do to a hole!
 You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that Ill most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
 Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
 Pam do you think anyones going to notice Ive worn this costume before?  When I wasnt pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
 Oh, no.
 Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
 Oscar, use a calculator.
 You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
 Six-seventy, six-twenty.
 yes!
 Ohhhh!
 Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago A Beautiful Mind-
 Okay, Andy, we get it. Its a trip to Gettysburg.
 Enough Oscar, enough.
 This is all pathetic.
 Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
 No. Porcupines dont have souls. Theyre like dogs.
 Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
 Yeah, it is, Andy.
  Oh, it is warm.
 Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
 Youre in my way!
 Were in the pool!
 Oh, it is warm.
 Yes?
 Oh... I dont- I dont want any- what are you guys doing here?
 Hey.
 No, you will not.
 Mm-hmm.
 Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
 Aw, preemie pajamas!
 No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
 Shh.
 Its fine. Pajamas arent supposed to be baggy, right? Its not the barrio.
 Ah!
 Really?
 Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
 The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
 Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
 And now you all know, but you can never tell. Im serious.
 Dwight?
 Hes hungry.
 No, you dont have to. Im going to wear this cover.
 You wont see-
 Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
 That is completely untrue.
 I did not. Uh-uh.
 That didnt happen.
 No! Stop it!
 Dwight.
 And even if it did, its just a coincidence.
 I will not.
 I will not, its not-
 Yes, yes. Hes sleeping.
 Sure.  Watch the head, watch the head.
 Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
 I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.
 Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. Ive got brownies and magic cookie bars.
 I dont know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
 Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
 I wouldnt know, Im watching my weight. Ugh.
 Ok, its obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
 My baby is not a monster!
 So cute.
 News flash - If you didnt carry it around for nine months, it isnt your kid.
 That is where we disagree.
 My Phillip is crawling.
 No one said "you must have two"
 No thank you.
 Stop it.
 Stop it.
 Paid.
 Is this spicy?
 1434-967, paid.
 Black eye, Meredith.
 Yes.
 Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
 Yes.
 Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
 Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
 Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
 Thanks.
 Lets go Kelly.
 So, hes alive.
 Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
 Ugh.
 Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldnt have to work?
 Cause we come here to do our jobs. We dont stick our noses in other peoples business.
  We should do it right here in the break room.
 Pam, we have a great idea.
 Were going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. Its gonna make everyone sick.
 Okay.
 I knew shed crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
 Nobodys named Monday.
 Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy Id be if Pam died.
 On it!
 You got it.
 What are you doing?
 Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
 Ugh.
 Ugh. Eww!
 Oh God!
 Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... Im sure it will be fine.
 My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a whos who of the northern 22nd district!
 We think you might kill Robert.
 Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
  Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Dont worry, I wont lay an egg.
 Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If?
 I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
 No thank you.
 Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
 Heh.
 Dwight.
 No. I am going to hold him because I havent seen him all day.
 I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my babys DNA to prove hes the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man Ive ever been with.
  See the duckie!
  No. No. I like the babys hair the way it is.
 Uh-uh, leave us alone.
 Dwight, were fine!
 Oh no.
 I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
 No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
 No! God, Mose! God!
 Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
 Yes!  Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
 Where is it?
 How long does it take to get the results?
 Youre gonna wait here?
  Dwight, I cant do this. Dwight!
