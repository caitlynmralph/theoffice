 I cant, Sprinkles is sick.
 Shes been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
 I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
 Theres bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
  All right!
 Hey D.
 Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
 I have to visit the alchy.
 I wouldnt put it past her.
 I wrote it out.
 Theres a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, dont shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she wont see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after shes eaten. And, oh and theres a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so youre gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
 No, thats not. Thats next to cleanliness.
 Hey.
 Any problems?
 What!?
 Sprinkles.
 Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
 Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
||
 Alright.
||
||
 Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasnt ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
 You never... you dont like them.
 Thats why were cursed.
 This is Sprinkles.  She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year,  just a couple of kittens  out on the town.
 Pssst. Im having relationship problems. And since youre always having relationship problems, I thought youd be able to give me some advice.
 I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
 When I got home, Sprinkles body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
 Somethings not right. The vets doing an autopsy.
 Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
||
 Shut up.
 Oh, really?
  Im not depressed Im in grief.
 No.
 The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
 What does that mean?
 You did kill her!?
 You put her in my freezer.
 Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
 You!
 Its OK.
 Its nothing.
 How could you do that without telling me?
 Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you dont get there if youre euthanized.
 You dont understand.
 Dont touch me Dwight!
  For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
 Its not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
 What do you want?
 Oh, what is that?
 Her name was Sprinkles.
 I cant believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before shes even in the ground.
 Dont rush me. Im grieving.
 I dont want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
 Hello, Dwight. Ive been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
 Yes.
 I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
 Very much. Hows your meat?
 I heard a joke today.
 Yes, it was.
 I cant do this. I cant be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles stiff lifeless body.
 Im sorry. I gave this everything I could.
 I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
 Thank you.
 Is that all?
 Elevators.
 Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
 Good.

  Waste of time.
  Waste of time.  The websites going to win.
  I dont care, but yes.
  I dont care, and you wont.
  I wont be watching, and I wont.
  Lunch party?  Its supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
  I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
  It is awful.  Youve made this day awful!
  Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
  Its supposed to say launch!
  I care!
  Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And heres $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots wholl do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cats still dead.
  Is just looks bad.
  I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
  Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
  Goodie.
  Because theres a party! A party for the website Ive been planning for two weeks.
  Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
  Theres still an hour.
  I didnt ask you to do it for me.
  How do you tell someone its over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
  Hello, Pam.
  Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
  Let me know.
  Thank you.
  The party starts in an hour.
  Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
  Something made of ice?
  Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
  Chocolates?  Someone famous?
  Cool music.
  Confetti.
  Go-Go dancers?
  I cant do this.
  I cant do it.
 It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
 Ow!
 What?
 I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now Ive got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now theres no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing thats made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and its itched all day, and I cant reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
 I have to hang these.
 I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
 Thats why youre not in charge Meredith.
 How did you, um, where did you...
 Will you help me put it over there?
 Okay.
 Ow! What are you doing?
 I didnt ask you to scratch it.
 Im not dating you.
 I have to go clean up after the party.
 What about my cherub figurine?
 No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
 Fine.
  You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
 Thats not happening.
 I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
 Jim, we need to order a cake for Creeds birthday.
 Yes. Kellys was last week, remember?
 Its birthday month. Creeds is today. Oscars is week after next. Merediths is at the end of the month.  Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
 What?
 I dont like it.
 No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You cant just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
 What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?
  No, no.
 What am I supposed to do with this?
 Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
 I dont know.
 Another clue, another clue.
 Those arent helpful.
 You shouldnt joke about that.
 So you keep a very tidy house.
 Ive noticed how you look at him at the office.
 Yes, What are you doing here?
 I hate beet salad.
 The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
 I dont think that this is---
 Its ridiculous.
 Im right here.
 We get it.
 Yeah, neither did I.
 Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
 Mmhmm.
  Its a man eating cat food.
 Extension 128.
 No.
 Bless you.
  Thank you.
 We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
 But so far we only have two pictures of him.
 Michael...
 No. You know-no!
 You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby wont be in them.
 No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I dont want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
 Phyllis, you look like youre gonna have a heart attack.
 I shredded it.
 Gosh, I just dont know. Why do you think?
  Well, I hope you had fun today, because youre never ever throwing a party again.
 ...Okay.
 I said, okay.
 No.
  Oh my God!
