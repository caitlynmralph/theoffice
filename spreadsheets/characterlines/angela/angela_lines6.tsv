  Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
 Want me to say it again?
 No. We heard that about Jim.
 How is that a bad rumor?
 I knew it!
   Rude.
   Mmm hmmm.
   Pam, my bag was there...
 But, I do not understand. If were such smart adults, then why dont we get raises?
 Yes. They dont get em, if we dont get em!
 What are you talking about Michael?
 Its not like were not gonna see the checks. Were in accounting!
 This is how you make this important decision?
 Decent people everywhere will get offended.
 Well, youre lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
 Really, Pam...
 Ow! He pinched me!
 And where do you think youre going?
 Well, why dont I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
 Mmm-hmm. Ok. Ill go with you. Come on.
 Are you sure?
 Itll be fun.
  Oh my God.
 Yes.
 Relax.  Youll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970s key party.
  I have some ideas about conservation...
  Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
  Well, for our profit...
  Im sorry, I was told I had the floor.
   Pam, hows your day going?
 Black widow.
 Why isnt Jim wet?
 So you fell in?
 So a child had fallen in?
 Thats never the case.
 This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
 Why?
 I was.
 Whyd you stop it?
 No.
  Pam, arent you going to introduce us to Michaels girlfriend?
  Put your hands in your pockets.
  Michael, I dont like this game.  Its scary.
  I dont like my character.
  Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  Im not comfortable with this.
 Its not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
  Hey everyone, Kevins going to give us his take on the situation.  Lets listen up.
  Dont just say things.
 To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
 Yes!
 "It could only be you!"  Way to go.
 Amen.
 Its fabric! I really wanted this.
 Andy, is this you?
 Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
  If you know something Michael...
 Come on!
 Thank you.
 Have a great day.
 I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
 Thats your toast?
  No, no!
    What are you looking at?
  Excuse me?
  Good afternoon.
  What is this?
  Of course.
  You know I was thinking...
  Agreed.
  Jedediah.
  Jedediah.
  No Star Trek names.
  What if its a girl?
  Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You cant put that in here.
  No.
  Absolutely not.
  Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract Ive prepared for you?
  I look forward to it.
  Goodbye.
  And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
  Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
 Hey!  Are you sick?
 In your nose?
 Yes, Im anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. Its not to celebrate St Patricks Day. Its so I can protest St. Patricks Day.
 Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because Ive e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
 Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
 Ill give you the leads. But you know what? Its going to cost you some clerical work
 It doesnt matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when youre done, you can watch me shred them.
 Im not going. You did this, not us.
 Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Ow!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
This looks like a hoot.
Whack.
Okay.
Its no worry.
I could see enjoying that.
But we signed the contract.
We both-you didnt dup-
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
Did he not tell you that?
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Dwight?
Youll see me in small claims court!
 Psst. Hey. Erin.
 You embarrassed me earlier.
 You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? Its the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
 You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
 Angela.  Michael.
  Uhh!
 I knew it. You should see their baby.
  Is this the thing where they use an icicle so theres no evidence?
  No.
  Rather than spend all day in court, weve decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
  Alleged? Im going to own your farm by the time this is over.
  Im doing it. You know I am. Its disgusting.
  Dwight, look at my teeth.
  Same page. Go to the next one.
  What?
  He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
  Well, I have an alternative.
  Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
  I want eye contact.
  Yes.
  Im not some farm animal.
  No.
  What did you do to yourself?
  Well, it better work.
 Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? Its on the same site!
 Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
 Okay, well, Nick, were in a meeting.
 It does!
