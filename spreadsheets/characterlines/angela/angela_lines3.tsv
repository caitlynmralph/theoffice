  It explains so much.
  Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  Its terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  Hes so talented.
 Watching some of your friends.
 Judges and juries!
 Sign.
 But I dont understand. Its for managers.
 I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together.  Are you still there?
 Dont "Monkey" me! You cant wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
 In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly." Thats code for "check out the slut." What is... why are there flies in here?
 That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
 That town is full of history!
 Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
 D?
 I dont approve.  I dont.
  Kitchen.
 Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and were all going to lose our jobs.
 You know she has it out for him now.
 Dwight, you should be running this office.
 Its not up to Michael, its Jans call. Talk to her.
 Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
 I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
 Congratulations Dwight.
  Its really happening!
 We can make a difference here.
 You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
 Hi.
 I do not wanna talk about this.
 We really have a lot of work to do right now.
 A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
  But...
  Amen.
 Sales take a long time.
 Im sure Dwight will protect him.
 Hes not weird, hes just individualistic.
 Youre a freak!
 Dont go. They eat monkey brains.
 How many gods do you have?
  And that blue busty gal? Whats her story?
 I find this incredibly offensive.
 Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldnt all be subjected to it.
 I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
 Im a vegetarian. What can I eat?
 Ill just have some bread. You used your hands.
 Dry. You look like you were having fun.
 I have to watch our shoes so they dont get stolen. Who were you texting?
 What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
 I dont want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyones to blame.
 I dont want to go all the way to Dunmore.
 No seafood.
 Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
 No.
 Yes!
 Oh.
 I do like it, actually.
 Thank you.
 Maybe thats because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
 Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
 Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
 Last week.
 One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
 Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
 Hmm.
 Andy?
 Sure. Lets protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
 Do you really expect us to believe youre somebody else?
 Dont encourage him, Dwight.
 Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
 No, orange is whorish.
 It would never work here.
 No.
 God help you.
 These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.
 You tried this out, and its clearly not for you. Its time to go. Come on.  Please.  Thank you. OK, thank you very much.
 This shouldve been up yesterday.
  What is that?  The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" Theres no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties."
 Well, you just cant start a committee. You have to have funding.
 Two hundred dollars.
 No, that is not a party. Theres only one party and its hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three oclock.
 Phyllis?
 Pam, dont tell her what to do! Phyllis.
 I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!
  I need to know if I can start the party?
 Did Michael give you permission to do this?
  Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now
 Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
 I said you wouldnt be disappointed.
 Meredith, if you dont come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
 No, its an invitation.
 Brownies. Cupcakes.
 I dont back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we havent talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I dont even remember. So... yeah. Im pretty good.
 Try harder then.  Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyones had some.
 Youve got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
 Wheres Dwight?
 Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think youre going with that?
 You cant have it  I dont walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
 Did you have fun at Benihanas?
 Ive had the worse day here
 Im not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
 Oh, I may have seen it somewhere.  Is it this one?
  Copy, Possum. Whats your twenty?
  Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. Thats fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
  ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum
  I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
 By the end of the day? Thats impossible.
 Michael, theres no way we can do it in time.
 OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and youre not helping.
 Did you try the petting zoo?
 What?
 They arrived this morning.
 Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
  Everything ok?
 Thank you.  I... I dont want those.
 Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
 Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
 Ok.
 This friend of mine - lets call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - well call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. Thats... I dont know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
 Yes, it is.  Hello?
 Thats great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
 I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Well then. Have a nice day.
 How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
 I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
 Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
 Oscar.
 Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
 Yeah.
 No. No. Certain events have transpired. And Ive thought about certain things. And Im sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
 Thank you.
 Never.
 Yeah.
 Oh.
 No.
 I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
 Yes.
 None of them. Especially not Andy.
 Are you enjoying your fiesta?
 Welcome back.
 Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
 Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
 Sparkling cider is very good.
||
 Thank you.
  Hi, Dwight.
 Thank you. Dont linger. Break left. Left!
 Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
  ... Please dont let that stupid thing near me...
 Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
 No thank you, Roy.
 You saw it?  Describe it please.
 Oh...
  Well... good for Dwight.
 What happened, exactly?  I wasnt here, so I havent really heard the whole story.
 Mm-hmm.
  Goodness.
 Youre useless.
 Then whatd he do?
 Dwight.  Dwight.  Ive been doing some very interesting reading.
 Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
 Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
 This is just offensive.
 Kellys training us?
  I dont have a headache.  Im just preparing.
 Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
  Excuse me?  Well, I dont see how thats our fault.  And Ive already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I dont know what you want from me.
  Where are you from?  Ohio?  Thats nice.  So what do you want?   Hes upset about the watermark.
  It was an unfortunate error.
 ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not.   I think he had Tourettes or something!
 Kevin, whats four plus seven?
 Yeah, well you didnt know that when you filled out this payroll form.
 You two are apes.
 Im sorry... that youre both morons.
 I called you morons.
 Phyllis. Youre a married woman.
 What is so funny?
 What a surprise.
 And when we get mad, you always ask us if were on our periods.
 This is not work talk.
 Malls are just awful and humiliating. Theyre just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a juniors section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids size 10.
 Meredith, slow down! Were not gonna get there any faster if were dead.
 Thank you, Michael.
 OK. Im gonna be at the doll store.
 Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So Im forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
  Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up.
 Everyone put on sunscreen.
 What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
 I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
 What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
 I dont understand what you want from me.
 Sorry! Bye, Andy!
 Im not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
 Or Mrs. "Outside Hire."
 Why?
 Wha? Who gave you that advice?
 But you said you were in debt.
 No Dwight, I dont care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
  Not now.  Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
 How can she make you get back together with her?
