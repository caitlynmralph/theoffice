 I told you
 Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
 No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . Hes such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
 Please, after the turtle?
 Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
 If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
 Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasnt given me a definite yes or no.
 Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, Im fine with either, but not both.  Listen, youre in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
 Why do you want this cat?
 How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
 Have you taken any concrete steps?
 Allergies.
 No, the baby. Please, its my husbands favorite cat. Hes broken up about it. Its the only time Ive seen him cry other than our wedding night.
 Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
 Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He wont get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
 Please dont teach the cat French.
 Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.  Im sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
 The senator and I still have mystery. Im always waiting to see what hes gonna surprise me with next.
  Language.
 Oh!
 OK, I have one. I have one.
  Kevin, stop it with that question.
 Has she done the pageant circuit?
 Ooh!
 Oh my god!
 I, I need to get to the paper please.
 So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
 Oh!
 The senator will be joining us later.
 No, it wasnt.
 And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
 Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
 You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
 They lost me when they sang â€˜Monster Mash. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
 Jammed. This day couldnt get worse.
 What does that mean?
 Kevin, were out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
 I dont know why Im surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
 That doesnt surprise me.
 The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
 That man hes up against is so dirty. And the senators just pushing back as hard as he can.
 What?
 Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.
 Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
 Honey! What are you doing here?
 Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
 Hi.
 Spring cleaning?
  I think the senator is having an affair.
 I think the senator is having an affair.
 When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
 And hes always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - its Hot Yoga with Blake.
 I dont know.
 Right.
 Right?
 What?
 Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
 Where?
 Oh my God! Shes so stunningly tiny!  Shes like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what theyre doing.
  Ive heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. Id like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Lets go.
 Ow.
  Okay, we should go now. Lets go.
 Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Cant get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
 What?
 Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
 Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
  Oh. Oh.
 Oscar...  can I ask you a question?
 Is it cool in here to you?
 I think the thermostat is acting up again.
 Thank you.
 Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
  Ugh!
 Dwight, its not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
 Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
 My marriage is in danger. I dont know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
 Â Something like that.
 Can you arrange a meeting?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Ow! Dwight! Ow!
 God!
 So what are your credentials?
 Do you have a gun?
 What is this?
 You dont carry it with you?
 Obviously.
 Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
 Murder.
 What if they deserved it?
 Theyre sleeping with my husband.
 Thank you.
 No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
 Yes, a knee-capping could work.
 You said you would be there for me.
 Its the only thing that will make this right.
 Oh, thanks, Oscar. Youre such an angel.
 What? Why did you call me out here?
 I dont know what youre talking about.
 Fine! Its Oscar. So what?
 Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
 Well, you might be right. But its too late now.
 Hes here.
 No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
 You know, theres doughnuts in the break room.
 You deserved every bit of it! Â You made my husband gay.
 No. No.
 Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
 God!
 You were supposed to be my friend.
 I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
  Jazz is stupid! Â I mean, just play the right notes!
 I dont like your friend Trevor.
 My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
 Well, he didnt fight me hard on it.
 What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
 Is it called red-vining?
 People red vine.
 No.
 Oh, right, like Im responsible cause Im in charge of the party planning committee.
 Dont blame me for something we all forgot.
 No!
 No.
 No, no, no.
  Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
 No. I dont want my name attached to this party.
 Please just take my name off of everything.
 Huh.
 Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
 Dwight!
  Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
 Ew! Oh.
 Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
 What do we do about our heads?
 Excuse me?
 Oh.
 We dont want it to last longer. Its horrible.
 Okay. Oh, thank you.
 Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
 You dont want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
 Oh my God.
 Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. Shes a monster.
 Sorry.
 Oops.
 No, I dont no.
 Cant I just agree without putting my hand in?
 Oh, fine.
 Ugh!
 Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
 Stop it!
 Stop it Kevin!
 Kevin!
  I dont get the point of this stupid window!
 Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
 Shut up!
 Yeah!
 Whats going on?
 Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
 I have no information. But Im sure as soon as they know, theyll call you.
 Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
 Yes. And he didnt like it.
 Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that .
 Oscar, dont rub it in. Im sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
 I dont want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
 I dont want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
 Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? Its Phillips first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
 No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
 No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
 What?
 Im his! His... wife.
  We agreed that you wouldnt be seen with him in public. Its humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
  Hey!
 Exciting news. Theres room for one more at my sons birthday event. And, I want you.
 What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
 No.
 Aw, crap.
  Oh, Robert, youre horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here?
 Hes blocking me.
 He put you right in front of me?
 It was all my fault.
 They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit.
 Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you havent been here for 12 Fridays.
 Its a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded its targets over the past quarter.
 Uh-huh.
 Ahh! Dwight!
 What? What is it?
 Dwight, thats awful.
 What do you mean by â€œpoisonedâ€?
 Ok, well Im very sorry about your aunt.
 But I dont see how this is my problem.
 Ugh.
 Gah.
 Its fine.
 Ugh! God, I cant. OK, Ill-
 Ill help you!
 Ugh.
 Hello Aunt Shirley.
 Oh, God.
 Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
 Ow!
 No. No.
 No.
 Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
 Spray her down?
 You have to use chains?
 Dwight!
 No! No!
 Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
 No Dwight!
 No, Dwight!
 No Dwight, I wont-
  Im gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
 Good.
 Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
 I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
 There.
 Youre welcome. Would you like some stew?
 Mmhm.
 Is it any good?
 Thank you.
 Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
 It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight.
 No, Dwight. The Senator.
 I cant be your monkey, Dwight.
 I made a vow. I gave my word.
 Good night, D.
 Do they even have a bakery anymore?
  Kevin, you can do this.
 Uh-huh.
 What, Pam?
 Hes gone. Its just a cupcake now.
 Kevin?
 Some of us got both.
  No.
 Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
 Here you go. And good for you Dwight, Im so glad you found someone. I bet shes got kind eyes.
 Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  Shes coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe shell be pulling the horse cart!
 Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
 I bet she does.  I bet shell eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
 Yes.
 I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
 What about me? â€œKlokken tre pigeâ€
 What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that?  Oh! I didnt know they were filming then!
 Oh my god.
 There was much more secret filming than I expected.  But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
 Come on!
 Oscar.
 I think we need to figure out whats going on. I might just take a little walk.
 We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
  Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
 Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!
 God!
 Oh!  Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
 Call him!
 Call him!
 Call him! Call him!
 No you go. Hi honey!
 Its Angela and Oscar.
 Just a few quick things.
 Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
 Yeah.
 Yeah!
 Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didnt tell you about it.
 I think were good.
 Bye!
 Love you!  God.
 Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Â Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
 All right, if I have to be the good wife, Ill be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, Im a better wife than that.
||

 Oh my god!
 Nellie you didnt tell us we could win money.
 Me? Oh, Im fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that Im separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine  for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
 Come here, come here. Lets go.
 I had a chance with Dwight, but I didnt take it. And if I went back now, when Im broke and he just inherited a farm, Id be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
 Really?  Thank you.
 Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadnt noticed.
 Come on Clark.
 No you cant baby!  Good luck.
 Whoo!
  Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok its your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
 Yes!
 Thank you.  Oh god!
 Dont you dare tank this.
  Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
 I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I dont need pity and I dont need charity. I have my dignity and thats enough. And as long as I have that, Ill be ok.
 No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
 Two sacks worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
 Its the  that lives downstairs. Shes this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
 And theyre gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
 I guess.
 Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
 Yes. Congratulations.
 This is a big day for you.
  This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if theres a problem its clearly on your end. Andâ€”oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didnt want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control shouldve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!
 Andy.
 What are you doing?
 Yeah, okay. Thats not what I mean. You dont have to leave because you said you would. Dont let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? Its not worth it.
 Ugh.
 No, thats notâ€”
 No, noneâ€”No, stop. Its justâ€”
 Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
 Thanks.
  Its just a really nice song.
 Well, Ive changed my mind.
 Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
 Oh, god.
 You dont want me at your place.
 Well
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Are you allowed to have pets?
 So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
 I wouldnt know. I never lived with a gay guy.
  I love him.
 No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
 Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
 Daycare wont take Phillip anymore.
 Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they wont forgive. So, hi.
 Why didnt you pack the apple snacks?
 Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
 Why dont you pack it?
 Not now, Kevin. Cant you see were busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
 Ok, you go to the store.
 Kevin, Kevin.
 Kevin, could you not do that?
 Kevin, where are you going?
 I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
 Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
 Its just his way of saying, â€œThanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.â€
 Would you like to hold Phillip?  Yeah. Thats Kevin.
 Okay, watch it.
 No, Kevin, no.
 Stop it.
 No, no!
 Hey. You wanted to see me?
 I am sorry hes here today but I hadâ€”
 How thoughtful.
 If he is your son, thats a great plan. But hes not. Hes not your son.
 Can I go back to my desk now?
 Okay, bye.
 Are you sure you dont want me to drop him off?
 All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
 Dwight?
 Why?
 What do youâ€”Dwight!
  Dwight! What the  is your problem!
 Who drives like that?
 Can you put that down?
 Its too loud.
 Okay, yesâ€”yes, I will!  I love you!
 And I lied to you.
 Phillips your son.
 I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
 Youre a dad!
  Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace.  Look at Meredith. Shes disgusting. Those feet. Theyre like the paws of an orangutan.
  To remind you that our weddings gonna be wonderful.
 D, its gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
 I dontI dont know why.
 This is my big sister Rachel.
  Were very close. We even have our own special language.
 People love it.
 What?  Okay.
 Wait, what is this?
 Okay
 Rachel, are you all right?
 Oh geeze. . Oh, my God!
 Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
  Uh, no. Its othank you. You know what? You dont have tooh no, no, no. No, no, no. Its okay.
 That was interesting.  What was that?
 Will you lock the door?
 Alright, see, you dont have to leave the door wide open. We get it. Its the wind. Just come and shut OH! My God!
 What the  is your problem you   ?!
 Thanks.  Oh. Ouch.
 No, my heels arent too high. Its because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis.  Sorry Phyllis. You didnt know. As long as I can get to the altar.
 Hi.
 Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
 Do you even have a mattress?
