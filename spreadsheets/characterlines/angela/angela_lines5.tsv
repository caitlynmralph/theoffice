  What?
  No. No.
  I dont care.
  Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
  No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
  It doesnt matter, Michael.
  Listen, dummy! Its not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you cant do it.
  But hes an idiot!
  Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
  Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
   Hurry, we have to make this fast.
   Hey!
  I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and its lights out by 830. Thats how I sleep at night!
  No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
  Its not my problem.
  That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it.
  I know I havent made this easy on you.
  I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
  Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
  Really?
  Mmhmm.
  The guys?
  Mm-mm
  I dont think that...
  I dont know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
   Lets talk about this later.
 That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
 I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out hes clean, but Im glad I did it.
 Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy." And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name "Astird."
 Michael wrote down "Astird."
 Its a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
 Thats Phyllis.
 Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
 Well, it does.  Thats me.
 Yes it is.
 Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
 You gave birth in a tub?
  Thats good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
 Now. Come on, up here!
 Your hands in it.
 Yeah, thats a good one.
 Yes, thats correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
 I never felt safe here.
 I would very much like that.
 Yeah.
 I think you have me confused with another person.
 I heard you.
 What are you doing?
 Not here.
 I dont want to be married in a tent like a hobo
 Nana Mimi cant be in canvas that long.
 OK fine you can have your tent, but only if its in a field, a hand-plowed field
 There has to be a barn thats old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
 No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
 Pay him whatever he wants.
 Be good.
 Meaning what?
  Hello? Hello?
 What?
 Are you drunk?
 I know who this is!
 What?
 Are you drunk?
 We will discuss this later.
 What?
 Are you swallowing them whole?  Youre eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
 Hmm, I liked it.
 I think Andy makes an excellent point.
 But my biggest concern is that theres only one bathroom.
 Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
 Manure. Get rid of it.
 Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
 Honey, say something!
 No. I havent thought of it.
 I would like cat.
 I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
 Yes it does!
 I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
 Its beautiful.
  Hello, Im Angela Martin, and-
 I work with Dwight.
 I do.
 Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
 What do you mean?
 Dwight! That doesnt count!
 No, it doesnt!
 I didnt-
 We are not married.
 Take this thing.
  Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
 Its the nativity scene.
 I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
 But--
 Really Andy? Its Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
 I dont--
 Please stop making me do these things.
 But its the season of mercy.
 I lost it.
 Its outside.
 Shut up.
 Im not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know youre not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you wont be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
  I think Id like to go home now.
 Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
 Thats enough.
 What is it?
 That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
 Youre expanding on your worst idea.
 Ive already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
||
 We can talk right here.
 What have you heard?
 That doesnt sound like me.
 Andy, Im engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didnt want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
 A little bit.
 I dont know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I dont know exactly when we started up again.
 Michael.
  Let me think about it... I, um... there...
 Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
 I said nothing fancy.
 I love you.
 Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that were not good together.
 Or, we can prove them wrong. Lets prove them wrong.
  I will respect the results of the duel.
  I cant believe theyre gonna fight over me.
 Im not voting.
 Oh my God.
 Ok, I wasnt going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I dont even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, shes hot, shes hot as heck, shes a female Boris Becker.
 Did you bring your jerky in again?
  Its okay.  Shh shhh.
 Oscar.
 Oscar!
 Pull me up!
 I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit!  Oh!
 What is that?  What is that?
 Michael!
 Michael.
 Oh my God! Dwight!
 What are you--  What are you doing?
 Oh my God!
 Dwight!
 If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, heres a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott.
 I normally dont enjoy making people laugh.
 If you ever called the fire department cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
  Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
 I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family.  Shes hypoallergenic. She doesnt struggle when you try to dress her. Shes a third-generation show cat. Her father was in Meet the Parents. Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
 Seven thousand dollars.
 I sold Andys engagement ring on eBay.
 He wouldnt have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
 Mm-hmm.
 I have something better than a picture. Come on.
 Yeah.  I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but Im out of vacation days. And this company still doesnt recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
 Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
 And person.
||
 No!
 Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
 No, now listen. You cant let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats.  I gotta go. Ill be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
  Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, Im looking for Mr. Ash. Hes a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. Cause Im talking to you right now.
||
   Has this been on the entire time?
  Well, sorry Im late.
 As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. Its been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of Gods most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! Its tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
 Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
 My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
 No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
 I guess I have.  Huh.
  Really? I dont see it. I mean, hes ok, hes not unattractive, its. . .
  That is so unnecessary!
  Thanks again, Charles.
  No. No one wants to see that.
  It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
   Hello, Charles? Charles!
  No!
   Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
  Well, wouldnt it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
   Bandit, No! No no no!
  Im sorry, I didnt realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
  Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didnt have any, you know, to stay trim.
   Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well youll let me know.  Good bye.
  These are for employees only.
 Youre bad at this too!
 Charles, where were you born?
 Sounds fun.
 Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know Im putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
 What do you hear?
 Okay.
 People are dressed inappropriately.
 The man is wearing sandals.  I dont need to see Oscars toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
 Excuse me? Oh. Youre so educated, arent you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I dont want to look at his feet.   Do your job!
 Meredith, too far!
 No. I dont want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
 Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
 Come.
 Kevin, come.
 Kevin, come.
 Come on, right now.
 Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
 Wha -
 Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. Theres no cookie. Theres no cookie. Come on. Come.
 Completely unacceptable.
 Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
 Stop!
 No. I didnt come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
 No. You need to sign them all.
 Look, I hate to be "that" person but I just dont like the general spirit of music.
 You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
 No.
 I can play.
 Rolph, did you not hear me?
 Kevin! Now its seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
