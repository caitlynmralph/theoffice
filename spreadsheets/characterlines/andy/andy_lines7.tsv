 Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
 And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
 Hey!
 Not at all.
 Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. Ive been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, its a humpback whale. How pretty. Hes eating Gabe.
 New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. Im the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
 That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
 Clutch cream run, bro.
 You get that kid to open this car, or Im gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
 This kids costing us sales, Michael.
 Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think hes burning my eye.
  No, no, no, no. Its the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
  Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
  Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
  Dwight?
  Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?
  No, you and I... and I. Im going to come with you.
  Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner?  How about now?  How about now?  How about now?
  Pretty Woman.
  Julia Roberts goes into the store, and shes like," I was in here yesterday and you wouldnt help me." And the shop girl goes, "ok". And Julia Roberts goes," You girls work on commission, right?" And the girl is like,"Yeah", and Julia Roberts goes...
  I was telling that... I was telling that.
  A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
  If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
   I think hes got it!
||
  After you.
 No.
 Steven Sondheim.
 Were the cast of Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
 Like a month ago.
 Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. Its closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scrantons Miss Fitness pageant.
 What? Thats awful. Everyones gonna miss that guy.
 Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. Its so powerful, even a lot of men cant resist a man singing show tunes.
 Everyone.
 What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. Youre all coming to my show tonight, right?
 8pm sharp.
 Hour forty-five.
 Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
 Dwight?
 It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
 If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
 This guys like world-class. You should not feel bad. Im asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
 Noishe!
 Hey, how are those salads?
 My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
 Yes!
 Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.
 Yeah, I know. Neiche!
 Guys?
 You all made it, thank you so much.
 Shes babysitting?
 I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
 Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" or "I still love you" type texts. Doesnt look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
 Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
 That monster of a judge has locked her-. Locked her away.
 Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. Hes gone to sleep now, Ive closed his beak.
  You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. Its off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. Ive killed it! Im a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know youre a murderer. My character doesnt know that yet. But Im suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But youre a barber, so thats legit. So theres that. But...
 A madhouse.
 Yes, a madhouse.
 Do you think...  so you think...
  Thats really irresponsible of Erin. Shes a terrible babysitter.
 Are you ready?
  Ah! Blood everywhere.
 Yeah, me, too.
 Okay.
 These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
 Awesome.
 See you later.
 Yeah, I guess you could say that.
 It was like amateur hour.
 Stop just saying that.
 Thank you. That feels good.
 Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
 Okay, all right, all right, all right.
||
 Uhh, beg your pardon?
 Very very smart.
 Oh its stinging him! Ow! Ow!
 Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
 You know what guys, why dont we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
 Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
 What do you mean again?
 Maybe like a year ago...
 No, thats...
 Everyone, Ive noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
 Its the worlds only international sport!
  Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na.  Yeah, now youre looking at me. Anyone whos interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
 So, guys. Ive been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office were better than that. Ok, now Im going to show you a picture of genitalia.
 What, is it because hes black?
 Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now Im going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.
 Its normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? Its just as normal as anyone elses.
 Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
  Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
 Express love, magical.
 Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
 Then I will write it down.
 I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
 Ok, umm. Ill move that. Thrill of risk.
 Yes! Thank you! Such as?
 Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
 Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
 Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
 Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
 I just thought Id bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. Thats all.  Anybody?
 Well someone could answer if they want to.  Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil.
 What?
 Well Im not gonna use my penis, Oscar! Its not exactly hard right now anyway.
 Im doing this for you Meredith!
 Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what Im doing right now?!
 I dont know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
 How is that relevant to anything?
 The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
 No Im just sweating.
 Im not crying Im just sweating.
 Ok.
  Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dans Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
 No, he died. Its Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
 "Some Vermont-based alums can hear Broccoli Rob Blatt, 96, in the state milk lobbys new milk awareness song, Calci-YUM!, featuring Phishs Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song."
 Yeah, yeah, its great...
 I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
  Knockity-knock, dont knock back. Just kidding you can knock; its your office. Do you have a minute?
 Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that youre entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
 Im starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
 This is for pleasure.
 Im willing to pay you.
 Yeah.
 Sixty bucks a session.
 Yes!
  Please Mr. President-
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but Im using my falsetto.
 Yeah, well, itd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
 Thats a lie.
 I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
 Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder whos gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
  Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
 But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
 I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
 Rude. And not helpful.
 Well, that...really bums me out.
 Thanks, Kevin.
 Reverse snobbery.
 Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
 Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-thats amazing!
  Which me am I gonna be today?
 I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
 Oh, my gosh! Were almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
 Wait. Seriously?
 So were just, like, jamming as friends?
 Closet full of mes-
  Ill be your croak madame.
 Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
 Ribbit!
 What about this one? Its kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
  Handbag.
 Shh! Shhh!
 Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
 You know what else?  The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we dont get invited to a ton of Halloween parties.
  Creeds going?!
 Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
 Hey, Danny.
 Im really sorry, but we cant come to your party tonight.
 You were?
 Were just like, totally caught in the middle here.
 Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
 Sookehhh.  Bill Compton, from True Blood.
 Whats up, man?
 When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernards Regards.
 I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didnt want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and thats actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, were going to Dannys bar. Public School.
 And a top of the day to you too, sir.
  Ah, man.
 Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put em in a box, give em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
 What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
 Michael, you cant go to Mexico. You dont have your passport.
  Save me an aisle seat, Michael! Im coming!
 I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
 Whatever. I wont-I wont stand for it.
 Were one in a million.
 Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
 Good-bye, Lackawana County.
 Well, two days minus how long weve been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
 I dont know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
 They dont know how.
 Well, Carla knows.
 Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
 And the Christmas party.
 Nah, no. Well be back before that.
 I can make myself cry.
 Should I-I got it. I got it.  Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
 Well, uh, theres a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
 Just make him stop the freaking bus!
 It doesnt matter.
 If we went to Mexico, wed probably screw everything up anyway.
 Stop the bus!
 I bet hes wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
  Youre having a party at Gabes apartment?
 You would?
 Try and keep me from coming!
 Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
 No what?
 Yeah.
 Oh thanks.
 Why does Erin like Gabe?
 Thats really nice, thank you.
||
  Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance!  Isnt that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
 My nanny used to wear that.
 I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working!  I feel exactly like a seahorse!  Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
  Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
 What does this say?
  Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind its here. Oh if it isnt the bell of the ball!  You throw a lovely party ma lady...
 Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
 Youre four seasons in a day.  You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba-  Put if you put on a blue...  Its Spring Time in the Rockies!
 No!
  Puts pillow in front of the puke.
 Erin likes Gabe.
 Do you think that theyve ever...
 Well girls tell each other things right?
 I accidentally ate some seahorses.
 I didnt know its powdered, so like four or five, I dont know.
 Thats so beautiful.
 I got it, try, um--
 Im sorry, nine days until what?
 Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
 You have his email?
 That sounds weird.
 Yeah, sell.
 Your doing the wrong thing. Youre gonna lose Michaels investment. Youre gonna lose ours.
 If you tell Michael to sell, hell sell.
 All those in favor of selling, say aye.
 Youre gonna lose all of our money.
 Whats the occasion?
 I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
 Eight dollars?
 Yeah, its where they make stuff.
 Hey Darryl.
 But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. Its insane.
 Got it. Then I will call you.
 Well are you?
  Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
 Oh, cool.
 Megan Fox! Come on!
 Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
 Oh, its on.
 It is not just coffee.
 And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
 Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you dont know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
 Michael, I have to tell you something its from Rocky II.
 This guy doesnt just wanna win. Yknow, he wants to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
 Im like a quarter of the way through.
 No.
 Yeah.
 Shhh. Youre gonna scare em away.
 Yeah. Right.
 Lets just jump in the air!
 Well, if we all jump really high, well be in the air longer. Do that.
 Yea?
 All good, Santa.
 Hello Kittys for girls.
 That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
 Is it criminal?
 Have we heard of it?
 Oh, Scranton Strangler!
 I bought these.
 These cookies are fine.
 I will help. Although my brid, my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, wont fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
 I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
 You know Darryl?
 I should come along, just cause hes my, you know, hes my hookup.
 Its cool, Darryl, Im here too.
 Come on, itll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
  Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Wont you be my Christmas tree.
 Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
 I dont have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, Im going to kill myself.
 Yes.
 Nobody hug me, Im covered in tree sap, so...
 Why would anyone frame you for that?
 I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
 Wahhh...
 No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
 Do you know the other state?
 The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out shes burning up because the star is right behind her ear!
 Drink less caffeine. Thats a good one, Pam. Heres mine.
 Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
 No, some people dont just meet someone. Im fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. Its not a party at all. Its just sad.
 Thats a good one.
 You know what, thats my new one. Im taking that one, too.
 The bookstore?
 All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
 Hi.
 Let us know if you need anything.
 Why did we pretend like we work here?
 Good!
 We kinda nailed it.
 Hey, theres a roller rink across the street! Theres always chicks at the rink.
 I dont know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
 Roller derby practice!
 Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
 I said no hits!
 Hey! Where did you go?
 Oh, cool.
 Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
 And where did you go?
 Thats actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard.
 Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
 Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
 Go higher. I get super flexible when Im nervous.
 No. What? You cant do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. Youre the charming warm-up guy,
 If the seminar was a meal, youd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
 You cant. You cant.
 I cant have this go badly. Im a terrible salesman, and I havent been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job Ive ever been good at.
 Theyre not worms, Dwight, okay? Theyre just people with tiny businesses. Theyre baby whales which is even cuter.
 Stanley, youre suppose to close.
 What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. Were suppose to be a team.
 Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and Im just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
 Hey, thats crazy talk. I think youre great.
 Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
 I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
 Can you do it?
 So no?
 What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
 All right!
 Okay, than you so much. Its going to be so awesome.
 What?
 Kevin, you open it up.
 Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
 Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
 Lets get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Dont Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone.
 Are you okay?
 Here...
 Im really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
 What are you...
 That brilliant little bitch.
 Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton.
  Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. Well meet back up in an hour.
 Thank you.
 Really?
 Excuse me.
  Hey, do you need a lozenge?
 What?
  Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
 Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back.  Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. Whats goin on?
 Maybe. Only maybe.
 Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
 Yeah, I mean, Im getting to it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 This is hard for me. Im a nice guy.
 Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually youre gonna realize you need this. So the only thing thats gonna be different is youll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So whos gonna buy one right now?
 Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else?  Sold! Anybody else?  Yes! All right!
 Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
 But it was a pleasure meeting you, and youve got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
 Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. Theyre on the outside. Dont how you missed em.
 Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought youd really like it.
 Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
 Divorced?
 Sorry, when did you get married?
 And you didnt invite any of us?
 Yeah, which one?
 Boo-yea!
 You?
 Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
 Woo-hoo.
 Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
 Phyllis!
 Oooohhh.
 Do the next one.
 Oh!
||
 Birthday punches!  One two three four five sice seven eight!
 ...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
 ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and Im taking Rachel. Shes picking me up after work.
 Oh, yeah!
 Whats up?
 Are you kidding me? Its all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
 But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
 Well, okay then.
 At least until Stanley calms down.
 D...d...d...d...dont look. I accidentally did his Sudoku.
 Shes neat. Uh, I met her at Darryls cousins party. We were the only two white people there.
 Hey, look at that. Done.
 I wish you well on your quest.
 Aww, I mean...
 Okay.
 Whoa.
  We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
 I think he can hear us.
  That makes sense, cause I feel like Id be able to hear us at this level.
 Darryl is a jerk.
 No, Im just testing if he can hear.
 Oh. Okay.
 The temp at night?
 Pi...
 Okay.
 Right. Okay.
 Okay, Ryans the temp. What does he do at night?
 Oh, or maybe not.
 How romantic is this?
 Right. Do you see a clue or...
 Oh, my gosh.
 No time to chat.
 Hey.
 B-9.
 Maybe its just more like, "be mine."
 Mm.
 Hmm.
 Some people are really popping on screen!
  Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isnt the president evil?
  Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around!  Check it out! This guys on a full beam reach.  Theyre hiking out like mad! Lock em up! Lock em up! Nice job! Ughh.  This computers a hunk of jjunk.
 Where did you get this?!
 This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer!  Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
 Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
 Well Andys desk needs a computer. And, I mean, its just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
 Im not asking for one, I need it.
 Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
 What are you gonna play mange on faster?
 Its crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
 Pam, when Im freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
 -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?
 Thats interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
 Seriously?
 Pam! Come on!
 Fine!  Please make sure no one is humping me!
 Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
 Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
 Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because were a little late.
 Mind if I close the door?  What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
 You humiliated me in front of every body!
 I mean, its pretty broken already.
  Pretty sneaky sis.
  Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not?  Oh I hope you dont get sick Mr. Computer.  Why are you doing this to me Andy?  Because I hate your programs!
 No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think Im gonna make myself cry.
  Thats probably good. Thats enough.
 Lets not go crazy.
  Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
 Whered you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
 All right, well thank you for my garbage computer.
 Close it.
 Close it.
  Close it.
 Just close it.
 Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
 Really?
 Well... theres no instructions.
 Im pretty good at board games.
 Sure.
  Hmm, Im gonna play me a little ol black mail card .
 And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
 Why not. Seems to me were just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
 Oooh.
 Well played.
 We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
 Well thats Dallas.
 You cant go, youre dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
 That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these.  nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
 I wasnt even trying to make a joke. But I guess Ive always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
 Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call...
 I... dont know. Help me.
 I dont mean to go into a rant here, but...
 I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
 ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans dont. Im thinking, how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
  I wasnt taking a position. Its just one of those things where-
 Yeah, right, I mean-
  Lets see if they have my favorite teas in here...
||
 I guess this is my life now.
 Why dont you think of hosting the Dundies like youre just running a meeting.
 A lot of people Id like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
 I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
  Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
 Hey!
 Why dont you, uh, stay away from me?
 Okay! Thats so weird! Just go away!
  Hi Tuna.
 Wow.
 You know Im the worst salesman here right?
 Im gonna lose em.
 I promise you that I will.
 No.
 I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost em!
  Hey.
 Im going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
 I thought wed just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
  What do I know?
  Yeah.
 Yeah!
  Alright.
 No. I dont.
 Awwhh, wow.
 Oh, okay...
 Mmhmmm.
 Uh DeAngelo, Im, uh. I forgot my bag, so Ill meet you in the car.
  Sir, Id just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that hes crazy, but the truth is I think hes just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
  Hey!  Good job boss!
 Hey!
 Oh, theres an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
 I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself.   Got some extra balls!    Hey-hey-hey-ho!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, Id be able to tell.  I took a crapload of womens studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the "Vagina Monologues" called the "Penis Apologies."  So I know a thing or two.
 How could I not see it?  Youre so right.
 And if he doesnt listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
 Yes!  Im in.
 Im going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.    Whats up, mancave!
 Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
 In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
 I know, right?
 Yeah?
 Sure. Whats going on?
 What?
 No, this is horrifying.
 Were just friends, okay?
 Yeah, fine, I promise. Well never date again. Can we go outside now?
 Pam, I have to show you this video. Youre gonna love it. Its Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in.
 Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
 Aah! Aah! Its so loud!
  Eeeeeeee... Theres like this crazy ringing going on. I cant - eeeeeee... I cant find perfect C.
  Somethings definitely wrong.
 I think I should go the hospital.
 Thank you, Darryl.
 Its my ear.
 Okay, sorry.
 Hey.  Were back.
 Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
 Yeah.
 Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldnt hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
 We have to clean this up now!
 No!
 Uh...
 Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
 And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
||
  The manager job? Nah, Im barely interested. I just cant not go for it. You know, its not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
  Dont even...  EEEHHHH!!!!
  EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
  In my family, you dont really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I dont know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and...  well see what Rosa comes back with.
   Good luck, Darryl.
  Okay, guys, its time. Its pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
   Augh.
  For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here...
  I wasnt acc-, accusing...
  Right! I really wasnt trying to insult any, anyone.
  What?
  Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
   Uh, 93 million miles.
  Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and...  333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
   I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
  Hey, Erin.
 Whered you learn how to puppet like that?
  Listen, Im really flattered, but I dont think we should.
  Erins my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didnt have that feeling, you know?  Arent there some things that you really want to like, but you just cant... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football...  Lets not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. Im not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? Im sorry.  I would go for someone whos more... shes great, though.
  Tuna... Youre completely sane.
  Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
  She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
   Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. Im educated. Im capable. I like all of you... and I wont make any changes.
  Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think Im about to do that.
