  After you my good sir.
 I insist.
  I its unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choices first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, â€œI need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.â€ Smart, right?
 Uh, this has got to stop.
 Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
 Hey, Robert. We have that 930am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
 First item on the agenda can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Dont know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
 The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
 Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for womens soccer, no?
 Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
 Oh, okay. I dont want any part of this.
 I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left sides the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
 We couldnt crack it.
 Hell know that we looked at his private notebook.
 Im already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and its starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
 Whats up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
 And it was open. And people saw this. And theyre just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
 Its a photocopy from your notebook.
 No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
 What?
 That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
 Okay. Roberts in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
 Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
 Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
 Dwight!
 Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
 Great group! Pizza party!
 Well, why dont you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
 Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
 Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
 Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
 Cmon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
 Yeah?
 When I was a salesman I could just be like â€œNot my job, not my prob. Im going to the warehouse to polish my knob.â€ Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
 Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please its really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, lets say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
 Thank you. Great.Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what youre talking about?
 Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what Im thinking of. Can you clarify that?
 No. No, no.
 Im going in there.
 I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you dont know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then Im not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
 Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think hes a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think hes hard to love, but did you know that hes in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
 Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word â€œnoâ€ not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that Im being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
 Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
 Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, were gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
 Yes, I do.
 I dont care.
 Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
 Well, you got it this year too.
 Night.
 Night.
 I gotta say, I think its kinda cool not knowing. Its like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? Its kinda sophisticated.
 Creed! Wha-  This is a safety issue with you. Theres no way to know if youre dead!
 Kevin, I appreciate what youre trying to do.
 Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what were talking about isbasically the speech equivalent to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need usebut need need for talk talk.
 What are you gonna do with all this time?
 Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwights meeting.
 I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on tiesand tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more?  What do you think, C-SPAN?
 Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause
 I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, Im sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub doghad to pull rank.
  Hi Dad!...... Ahhh.oh boy.
 Are you factoring in the whole national economy. declining and all that?
 I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor.vanilla?
 You were saying you chose me. There was a reason?
 Can I inspire?  I dont know!.....I dont know.
 You got it.
 Done.
 Neither am I, its already done.  Hah, Im just kidding, its going to take some time.
 D-Bone. There you are.
 No, thats ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about
 I know, right?
 Yeahum, how is everything?
 Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
 Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
 Theres gotta be some way you can double your beet sales
 Thanks for coming in guys.
 Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so Im gonna thank people.
 T-bag bone
 Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
 Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
 You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
 BahI think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
 Hundred and twenty points.
 Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
  Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of 95. Hey there, um, Im a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter hereDe-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to moraleuh why? Well, um I guess you could say Im in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.
 Took â€˜em one day.
 OK, keep in mind, its not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car  for a thousand points.or best offer.
 We should think about thisdoes anyone have any better ideas?
 Just need a second outside.
 Yeah.
 Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? .Confession I dont know what Im doing.
 My ass is only so big, I mean I cant do this everyday.
 No one expects me to go through with this, right?
 Lets inkmy stink!
 My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
 AHHHHH!!!!!!!
  Its a Nard Dog!  Thats my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
 When youre a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this  But then you learn thats crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this.  Or better yet, like this.  Now that Im manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
 Which combo do you think Roberts gonna like better?
 This is combo number seven.
 Youre right, youre right, youre right. Uh! Its so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
 Sure.
 Thanks T-Dog.
 Tuna dog!
 I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like â€œFly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texasâ€ Well I dont know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I dont have any bombs.
  Yeah.
 I dont have any ideas though.
 You do?
||
 Oscar, its not that hot out.
 Well, we dont know how long the drivers been gone and its not in direct sunlight.
 Were losing cloud cover.
 The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus.  This is it. This is all on my shoulders. Im the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, Im the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. Im the one who has to say those things.
 Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, Im gonna change my tone.  To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day.  Darryl, how we doin on the new warehouse guys?
 What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
 Are they on their way over?
 This is kinda time sensitive.
 Alright, well until we have a new crew, lets get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Whos in?
 Are you volunteering?
 Jim! How bout you?
 Great. And Kevin.
 You look awesome.
 Where are we in the process?
 Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
 You do have a fantastic basement.
 Right. Um, well how bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, thats pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go...there he is.
 That is not Darryl. I dont know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
 Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
 Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
 Well-
 Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, youre all doing great.  maybe grab a coffee..or if theres any donuts out you can split one. You know theyre for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut.  Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
 You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
 Good. Great. Then can you say things that arent like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more theyre gonna realize I dont know what Im talking about.
 We need you, OK?
 OK?
 Alright.
 Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now were gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
 Good. Keepin em honest.
 Are we scaring them straight....?
 Is everyone licensed?
 No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
 No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
 Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap?  Youll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
 No. Because they all left.
 I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didnt help.
 What are you talking about? Im not gonna fire you.
 ..OK, this is weird. I dont, I dont get the joke.
 So Darryl says to me â€œfire meâ€. But what he really means is â€œIm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.â€ So I say â€œNo, youre not fired.â€ But what I really mean is â€œI have no idea what your talking about, but Im gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.â€........I really hope thats what he and I mean.
 Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, whos the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
 Definition.
 Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
 Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying Americas diminishing blue-collar workforce?
 Great....Well, itll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
 Eh, cool. Well figure that out.
 Got it. Dually noted. You!  Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
 So cool! What a cross-section we have here. Thats what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldnt ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
 Surprise! Your new crew.
 Why? Because you didnt win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
 Yeah.
 Haha, what?
 Im not gonna give you my job! Its my job! I earned it! And heres the thing, you werent even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
 Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under DAngelo, what happened to that?
 He didnt die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and Id be happy to give you business classes. How come you havent asked me about it?
 None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
 Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
 Hey. Heres the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.
 OK what?
 Ah, OK.
 Yeah.  That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
 What is goin on?!
 Why is the truck empty?
 No, Jim. Tell us why its called SeÃ±or Loadenstein.
 Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
 What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
 Howd it look?
 No.
 What?  Morning, Stanley.
 Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
 Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
 Which one did you see?
 Yeah, Dwight.
 Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
 Its just a garden party. Sheesh.
 You dont need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. Its a garden party. You dont need a reason.
 Few other super simple reminders â€“ no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
 I get it, Im being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
 This is not a picnic, Phyllis, its a garden party.
 Aw, ew, please dont. Not a barbecue. Its better than a barbecue. Its dignified, quieter, there are rules.
 Im glad you asked â€“ Connecticut Casual.
 Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brothers promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, theres a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.
 Its my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesnt really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, thats my brothers boss. Look how psyched he is, hes having an awesome time.
 Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.
 See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
 Ooh, that sounds great.
 Sure.
 Uh, Ill hear the other one.
 You know, the marmalade sounds great.
 Then the basil will be fine.
 Hows it going over here, guys?
 Didnt mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if youre able, keep your elbows off the table.
 Well, technically FOR Andy.
 I dont know how you got there.
 This branch, Im the regional manager.
 Did I throw this party to impress my parents? Thats crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldnt care less.
 Can I introduce you around now?
 What are you going to see?
 What??
 I didnt know you were going to be here.
 Welcome.
 Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
 Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
 So pretty today.
 Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didnt make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
 Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. Thats my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
 Lets hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
 You cant triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
 Ah, come on!
 Yes!
 Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?
  Saying I love you is not the words...
 Yeah?
 Right, it feels strange.
 Saying I love... Saying I love you...
 Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
  Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
 Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. Id very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasnt even my worst sales call.
 I dont know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that youd be proud of me.
 I know, I know that youre proud of me.
 Hey everybody, Im gonna leave and I just wanted to say Im really sorry.
 Um, cheeseburger.
 Thanks, Oscar.
 Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
 Awesome.
 Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors doeuvres and the animals on Noahs ark?
 With Hors doeuvres we only take one at a time.
 My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, its just that maybe ones a little higher than the other?
  Approved!
  Chef from South Park, its genius!
 Ive decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - dont be offensive, dont be cliche, and dont take the first two rules too seriously.
 Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
 Costume vetoed.
 Ah, its, uh... somebodys already called that.
 Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
 Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. Its like, I cant choose. Theyre both amazing. Its just...
 I thought you were at your sisters funeral.
 Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
 There you go. Thank you.
 Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? Im not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
 I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - "Boo!" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - "Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high." Scared the s**t out of me.
 Gday, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
 Australian accent...
 Hey! Uh-oh, looks like were under a Jack attack!
 Yes.
 Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? Were still getting it set up, its gonna be really cool.
 Hey. Whats up?
 Yeah...
 Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
 Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
  Yes.  I dont know. Mmhmm.
 It really looks great.  You did a great job.
 We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 445?  Cool.
 Whats the story?
 I think weve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.   Yeah turn it off now.
 That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
 What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
 Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasnt.   Im sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
 Ok.  Erin I think you know Ive been dating someone.
 And its getting a little more serious.  Shes never come by.
 No I didnt want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now its weird that shes not calling.
 Thirty-one.
  Hey everybody its closing time. You dont got to go home but you cant stay here.
 Closing time.
 Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  Its weird.
 Closing time
 One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
 Come on pam!
 I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home.  I know who I want to take me home.  Take me hooohooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you dont want to sing no traditions!
 Whose your favorite iron chef?
 You go first.
 Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes
 Umpfthats not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
 Theyre both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture
 I would agree with that.
 End the mistakes, easy-
 I would like that.
 What do you got?
 Sounds controversial.
 Do not go there! Youre the deuce I never want to drop.
 Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
 Mmhmmm.
 Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
 And Id like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to callDwight
 If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
 Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
 Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
 Dwights our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I
 Alright everybody, you are doing great!
 Gahhh. Thats five strikes.
 Dwight we got five strikes.
 Did the email go out or
 Well, th- Theres gotta be a way to stop it.
 Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
 What?!
 Nn no.
 No!
 Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
 Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
 Kevin has that lovability.
 Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
 Gotcha something.  And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
 Well now hold on it, it-
  Where you going?
 Dwight, theres just a small matter of a-
 What are you doing? Its 5 to 5.
 Thats insane!
 Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
 Enngh-
 Oh!
 Lets not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
 Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
 Yes. Of course.  Erin..
 Yeah?
 I dont think so.
 Yeah. Im still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so lets hold off on the D-man for now.
 Erin.
 In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. Im not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
 Nobody. Just say that Im-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then Im going to refuse to take it.
 Just make up a phone call. Its not a real call. Make it up.
 And come and tell me. Doesnt matter what it is.
 Im not going to take it. And then hes going to be like â€œwhoa this is a really important meetingâ€.
 Okay.
 Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and Ill tell you how we can beat it.
 Yeah.
 Im sorry â€“ Im with a very important client. Itll have to wait.
 There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
 I dont think shes dead.
 Shes not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
 Yeah. Um line 1?
 Hi.
 Ooh, gosh!
 Officer.
 Did she have any last words or?
 Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
 That is so mom.
 Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
 Im delivering it from the fridge. Its like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
 Yeah and were not about to make love. I just thought maybe youd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
 Uh you tell me
  Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
 Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
  Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
 Well were all musicians and we play together sometimes.
 Thank you.
 Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
  CEOs dont play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
 Great!
 I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when youre in a rock and roll band with somebody, youre bonded for life!
 Yeah, even cooler.
 Yeah, absolutely!
 Midnight what?
 Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
 Well, we are playing. Were all playing together. These are our jam buddies. Its a jam session. We go where the music takes us.
 Maybe we could switch instruments.
 Cause, uh, my bodys starting to get bruised.
 We had to leave because of creative differences.
 Well-
  Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
 Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. Its okay.
 Hey guys, uh, cant keep saying youre going into labor. Everyone knows youre full of it.
 Never cry wolf.
  What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- its like a war out there.
 I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today Im turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend Americas bloodiest battle.
 Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
  Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
 That sounds super inspiring! Im in!
 Charge!
 Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
 Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
 You know, its the same as the kosher option. Theres a lesson in there. I mean, I cant force you to go. Youre not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... whos coming with me?
 Anyone whos not going, youre dead to me. Youre uninvited. I dont want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
  One for you.
 And one for you.
 And- oh. You missed your head.  There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
 All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
 Its just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Coopers birthplace, Id be the first one suggesting it. Id be rooting for it.
 All right, all right, all right.
 You guys...
 Get excited!
 All right! Were here. Limitless can wait.
 Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
 Woo!
 Whoa, where you going?
 Yeah, were not going to the visitor center. Were not tourists.
 Unless youre going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
 After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
 We dont need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where were going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
 Lets talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
 Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
 Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasnt about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys?  I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
 We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. Were all part of a business. But business is war. Whats that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- whats going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Whos gonna get the flag? Whos getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Dont look where I am, look where Im going. Juke right, juke left.
 Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
 Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
 Its I mean come on.
 Alright fine.  You know what â€“ I guess this place just hasnt rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  Im still going.  And Im not going to ask anymore.  Im not even going to look back.  Im just going to assume that youre with me.
  Dammit.
 You guys came.  Wheres everyone else?
 Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
 Even without an audience youre still at it.
 Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  Thats what you did with this trip.
 You dont like the hats?
 They just didnt turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
  The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and thats good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess its really more like theyre just people who work in an office and Im their manager.  Yeah thats really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
 Charge!
 Its kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
 Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
 Water.
 Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
 Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devils Den. Its the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
 Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but its not cool.
 That is what Im showing you.
 Everybody beat it. Dont beat it, stay where you are.
 What did you say?
 What would you say?
 That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, youre new name is Phyllis Order , get it?
 Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
  Andrew Baines Bernard.
 Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because its like taking a test, but I know the answers.
 What was that?
 Hey there. Its a pleasure.
 I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. Were 100 percent staffed up.
 Alright.
 Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
 We will start here at Erinville.
 Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
 I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
 Ill explore exploring it.
 Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller.  Alright have at it. Let â€˜er rip. What do you hate about this place?
 Jim?
 You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
 Dwight why dont you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
 Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than theyve ever been to me. What I wouldnt give for one of Phyllis classic room clearing farts right now.
 But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
 Those are fully staffed as well.
  Yes.
 Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
 There are lots of considerations.
 Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
 We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting.  Hang on. Hello?
 Hi gam-gam.
 Are you taking your med-meds?
 We promised wed never say goodbye.
  Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesnt want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
 I am not asking, I am ordering.
 It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, youre up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
  What is going on?
 Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, dont you?
 Why would you say that?
 Its not that, exactly.
 Lets just say that if you dont want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
 I dont know.
 Yes! The dude is an enigma.
 Ah...
  Cameras...
 It just was one of those things-
 Yes?
 No games?
 Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wifes gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen."
 I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
 No, its not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
  No, no. No, no, no! Dont! Damn it, Tuna!
 Jim, Ive had enough of your unhelpfulness.
  I think weve got ourselves an answer.
 That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
 Uh...
 Yep.
 Hey, Mrs. California.
 You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Who knows?
 Totally.
 Hmm?
 So, Roberto Californio doesnt want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this thats impossible.
 Ugh! Hes always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
  Christmas tiiiime is heeeere!  Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, Im Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
 Whos excited to get their holiday wishes?
 Whats that, Stanley?
 It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
 Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
 That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
 Light side.
 As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
 So, whos wish is next? Oh, what about Santas wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....Cmon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell em who Jessica is.
 Ugh! Gam-gams name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
 Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing thats not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
 Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and dont go near Gam-gam.
 Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this partyll cheer you right up.
 Oh, thank you.
 Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat.  But, this is serious. Its come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
 It wasnt either of you.
 Sh sh sh sh! Dont look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
 Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
 Alright. Im gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
 Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
 You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
 My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...thats just part of it.
 Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope youre not talking about my penis.  Hi.
 Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
 Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
 What?
 Oh no.
 Ut oh, its kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
 Edgy impressions.
 How many drinks have you had tonight? I cant be driving everybody home.
 Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
 Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
 What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
 I swear...
 I was too embarrassed!
 Um.
 Cici is Jims daughter.
 I know who did this....Dwight.
 Dwight.
 Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
 Its, I mean.
 You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and its like, hey, can they stay friends?
 Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
 No...I dont, hmm, I dont know.
 By the way, Im not gonna mess with you and Dwights bonuses. I think its causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
 Alright, Ill tell Dwight.
 Christmas miracles do happen.
 OK great.
 Perfect.
 I would, it just, that wasnt the holiday wish.
 OK, bye.  Alright Meredith,
 You bet.
 Thank god Erins getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed.  and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean hes going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
 Lets go, lets go.
 Hang on.
 What?
 What is all that?
 Its junk!
 Youre a hoarder. My god!
 Ah! My Santa suits stuck.
 Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
 Oh my god.
 Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
 Im sure I am not. Lets get you home.
 Whoo.
 Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldnt put the alcohol out till 11AM. Its just...common...decency.
 Its come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
 Dont look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
 For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
 Oh, I see.
 Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
 Alright, you got it.
 ...and an American Express green card.
 Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
 Well Ill do you one better.
 I got you health insurance.
 Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so Im gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
 Yes!
  Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
 Books! Excellent, Jim.
  Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?
 Im talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Lets get high on our own supply!
 Yes!
 Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. Thats today. And were eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I cant afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper thats in my garage.
 Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if theyre willing to "play ball." Those were his words.
 So make that error!
 Well, its just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but its a little more complicated than that.
 Its just, I really need a real accountant on this.  What do you say?
 Oh.
 What?
 You know what? Go. Have fun.
 Theres a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
 I didnt even say what it is.
 But heres the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
 Yeah? You like it?
 All right.
 Im so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid."
 There is one problem with this plan.
 Wed have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
 You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
 Ive got a quota to hit. I dont care how I hit it.
 Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
 It says that I believe that my staffs intelligence and that Im willing to try anything.  Not anything.
 Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but its winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
 A-team.
 All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except...
 Oh, we got this!
 Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
 Youre my sports guys! Youre ESPN, youre ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. Im E!, TLC and Oxygen.
 So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
  Whoo! Yeah!
 Go Einsteins!
 Oh, come on!
 Einsteins! Great work.
 You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
 Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
 Alright, if youre not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
 Not helping, tuna.
 We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Roberts face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
 No, thats why...thats why I said think of it.
 Have I mentioned that its also quite good for amateur animation?  Took me two weeks.
 Jessica! I love you! Thats a message from my mom.
 My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, Im just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I havent proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
 Um, Im getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
 Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
 Oh.
  Yeah, its pretty serious poolage.
 Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.
 No, Im good.
 Hi.
 Its great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
 Well, I cant. Im going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
 No. What?
 All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
 Okay.
 In a minute. In a minute.
 A minute would be cool.
 Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
 Where...
 No thanks.
 Kelly, thats a crazy ring you found.
 I cant believe youre wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
 The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
 You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Yay!  Whoa!
 I cannot believe youre still up!
  Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
 Ooh, do not remind me of Phylliss birthday.
 Mmm.
 Last I checked, Im with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. Its monogamy for my hog n me.
 Were done. Erin and I are over.
 Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
  Wow.
 Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
 Duh.
 Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, its not a special night.
 Honestly Erin, I dont know what Im doing. I... I just... I dont know. Thank you.
 Hey.
 Yeah, it sounds like it.
 Bring it on guys.
 Lets go before I vomit.
 Alright! Here we go.
 Hey! High-five!
 Val, I need the space.
 Everybody out.
 I cant promise what Im going to do or not do.
 Obviously Im going to clean up.
 Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town whos saying, "Hey, were uptight, you cant dance," and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance.  Sex also works.
 Hey! Tuna! Hes back.
 Oh, look at this.  Tuna wrap.
  Hand roll.
 Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
 Whats up, gangstas?
 Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
 No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
 Here, right there.  Down the hatch.
 Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
 Yeah, sure, of course. Id fire him to Timbuktu.
 I feel terrible getting lied to. No ones ever lied to me before.
 No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Heres what were going to do. Were going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
 Do you know why you never heard of it?
 Covered it up.
 They used to call me King Tut because Im so good at keeping things under wraps.
 My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
 Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
 Why? Everybodys heard it.
 Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole Murder, She Wrote thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
 Why? Why?
 His car broke down. So he called me, cause I live near the courthouse.
 Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
 Were getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
 Im not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I cant keep spinning gold out of your .
  I dont even know what the truth is anymore.
 Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didnt, then I hope I die.
 Dwight, cut it out. Im not firing Jim.
 I know what I said. Jim, youre in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and Im going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.
 Aw! You guys. Hes licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
 Oh!
 Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
 Theres cross-hatching in some of these. Thats kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
 Hey, Cece, why dont you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
 Hey, well be just fine.
 Oh, whew!
 Dwight, what the hell? You cant smoke in here.
 So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
 Youre nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
 Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something hes like to say.
 No.
 That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
 Ho hah!....oh, shoot.
 Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that shes no longer pregnant.  Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
 Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
 I think youre going to like it.
 Oooh, maybe I can.  I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
 That... you got a promotion!  Right? I mean thats not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
 No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
 And heres some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
 Yeah, its weird that I said that last one.
 Uh yeah, look at that.
 Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
 You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
 Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
 Theyre not expendable exactly, I just cant...I cant think of the word Im trying to find.
 Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, heres your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but youre also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
 You have your team.
 Mooshie mooshie.
 Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
 Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
 I use the word â€œguysâ€ a lot when Im nervous...guys.
 Guys! Guys! Guys!
 Guys..
 Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
 Wha-
 OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, Im happy to hear you out.
 No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
 Five to six hours?
 No no no no.
 Nope.
 Thirty minutes!
 Or both?
 Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, wow. Its almost like were not all experiencing the same winter?
 Well...
 Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
 Well it wouldnt be hard to find someone to fill in..
 Tuns, Im really sorry. Youre too essential to the operation here, I cant let you go.
 OK, listen up everyone, heres whos going to Florida Kathy..
 .Stanley..
 ...Ryan...
 ...Erin...
 ...And, Jim.
 Safe travels.
 Oh, K. Its only three weeks.
 Ahh!  Sorry I couldnt resist. Its so quiet.
 Its so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin...  I thought that would be cooler.
 Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
 Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow.  In the trash.
 Oh! There we go! Pam?
 Can you get the phone?
 Mm, well, you used to be.
 Phones ringing.
 Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin.  Hello, youve reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
 Yeah, I figured wed keep things savory while Oscars mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
 Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
 Up high.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy.  I put out some new magazines, check it out.
 Im acting like I like reception and Im a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks.  Oh, theres the phone!
 Mail call!  His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail cause its your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
 Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
 I found my calling.
  Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?
 I mean...
  Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
 Oh, shes on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
 I miss her too.
  Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. Theres nothing harder than taking care of a boatam i right?
 Okay, everybody. 500. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
 Say what?
 Say what?
 Say-
 Tonight were staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
 ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
 Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet its pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No.  I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves   A Jamaican feast, mon!
 Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
 Heyyy lets get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
 Goat
 Thornwood Wholesalers.
 Im pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
  yeah
 Thank you.
 Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
 Play it cool, man. Shell come around.
 Yeah, but My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
 Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee
 I got Romy and Micheles High School Reunion
 Morning, everyone.
 Dont care. Tell me later.
 What do you got?
 Yes, I do. Phyllis.
 What?
 Heres what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam
 They had, uh weapons.
 I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
 Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
 I didnt do anything any of you wouldnt have done.
 No.
 No, no, no, no, no, we dont need to call the police. Theyll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyones business, right, Pam?
 And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
 Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
 Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why Toby is giving us self defense training.
 Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
 Great.
 What if youre being attacked by a  smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
 What if youre being attacked by a 411â€ man who is penisless?
 Why dont we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
 So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
  Take that, kid.
  I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
  Listen, I dont know what you guys are talking about, but I guess Ill just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
 Oh...
 Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
 You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. Â I stepped in and I didnt care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, â€œWhere were you when the girls came?â€
 Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. Â I just feel good!
  Everyone stop what youre doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
 Hes gone, damn it! Hes been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and hes staying in Florida forever.
 Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
 How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke  of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
 I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.
 Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobodys gonna open it. Youd have to be insane.
  Now, carefully... open the box.
 Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Dont care what it is, dealers choice.
 Damn it.
  Hello?
 Oh, now mines broken. Hang on.  Oh, there we go.
 No.
 I dont buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? Im gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally puerto ricania when i see you.
 What?
 Yeah, thats awesome. Thats great.
 Im just dealing with Erins stuff since apparently shes not coming back. And she didnt bother to tell anyone.
 Ryan, why didnt you tell me?
 You never update it.
 Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
 Im going to Florida to get Erin.  Forgot to turn off my email. Its crazy, right? Its just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so-  Youre about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue? Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
  Hello.
 Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but Im super sick.
 Okay, Ill try to come in even though Im really sick with the...
  ...Florida Flu.
 Im in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasnt coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right?  Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
  Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; Im yours!
 Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
 Hm?
 Well, were not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few Is, you know.
 All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didnt want to stop until I saw you.
  Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
 Nope. Its just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell Im getting stronger.
 I dont know.  Just let it vibrate. Its fine.
 I dont think it does that.
 Jim?
 I- Im home in bed. Ive been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
 What do you mean, take my job?
 Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but Im not coming home without Erin. So Ill talk to you later.
 Yeah, if I had my own--
 --sorry, you go.
 Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each others mouth. Its just stupid. What were you going to say?
 You broke my heart too.
 Im so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
||
 That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erins favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm.  Its biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
 Erin!
 Okay.
 Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
 Like your toothbrush and stuff.
 You dont have a toothbrush?
 How do you not have a toothbrush?
 You just use whichever one is sitting there?
 Of course. I own my toothbrush.
  Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
 On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
 Mm-hmm. Its a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
 Oh. Hmm.
  Time to have a little kiss!
 Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
 I believe in that.
 I think thats important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
 Mm-hmm.
 ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
 Consider it nailed.
 Okay, here we go. Jessica, Im really sorry. I just need you to know-
 I just need you to know-
 Wow. Theres a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
 Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
 I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought Id stop and say hi to Jessica.
 Why is Erin with me? Thats a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
 Yep. This is Erin.
 Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
 Itll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
 These are delicious.
 Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we dont know Matthews history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life.  I dont know.  I just- I dont think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we dont pop that one.
 Hey.
 Oh! Ah, Megan.
 Aww.
 Oh, hes out there.
 Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
  By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
 No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
 Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
 Well, first just let me say that I hope when Im done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
 Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
 Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. Im gay.
 I am gay, and I prefer men.
 You did not, Kenny!
 I like hanging out with you. Youre a cool guy. Which proves my point. That Im gay.
 Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
 Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
 Understandable. And Im really sorry. I really am.  So... we should probably... go.
 Right? Rough scene.
 Oh... at least we can kiss now.
 You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- Thats just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
 Yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 I just gotta do one thing.
 Hi. Super-duper honesty time. Im not gay. In fact, Im so not gay, Im in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and shes right there. Shes sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
 Okay.
 Bye guys.
  My girlfriends back and theres gonna be trouble-
 ...my girlfriends back!
 Anyway, I know its the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
 Hey, Kev.
 Nice sweater.
 What happened to old salty?
 Okey dokey.
 Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram Ive been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard youve been hearing all about.
 I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
 Anyway, now that Im back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
 Obviously, well figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
 Get back to normalcy.
 This is what I was trying to tell you.
  Okay.
 You cant dock my pay-
 Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellies pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
 Angela?
 Ooh, shes counting again.
 Oh, oh!
 Seriously, Angela?
 I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
 Youre just saying numbers. Its meaningless.
 Its literally like-
 Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
 Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didnt last night.
 Yeah. I know its not... a big deal.
 You cant call a meeting.  But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So lets get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
 Oh! Cant do it cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
 Wanted to talk to all of you guys about  importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
 Fine, it was me. I couldnt- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
 I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didnt perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. Its usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
 Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
 Fascinating.
 Okay, so I-
 Yeah Jim, get it out there.
  Dad, dont think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I dont think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasnt been decided yet.
 Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
 Stop protecting me! Im a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and Im sorry! I dont mean to lash out at you! Theres a lot coming up right now, all at once!  Dad go to hell, Im taller than you!
 You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
 Why dont you take a seat, you idiot?
 And your stupid face!  And your stupid office!  Ah!
 That would actually be cool. Id love for you to meet some of the guys.
 No.
 Im saying no.
 No.
 No.
  No.
 No.
 No.
 I cant describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
 Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
 I... Got... It.
 Yes.
 Hey!
 What?
 guys, everything is fine! Im just here to pick up Erin. Were going to the Fundraiser.
 Why would that be weird?
 Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
 Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body!  I had you, I had you!
  Where do I look? Its been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! Whats the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
 What havent I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that Im writing, though it feels more like Im receiving it than writing it.
 The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship thats shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
 Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
 Bobby! Bobbo! Youre a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
 You gotta check out this thing Im working on, its really cool. Theres this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he cant control.
 Evil!  although hes humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
 Me, I guess.  Were flying so high, were crackin the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
 Youre being a Thomas Oregon!
 Dont need you to pay for me. Im doing just fine, thank you. Why dont you quit harshing our mellow?
  Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
 then Ill take a table!
 And a high five!  Oh, lets do this again!
  Oh, yes indeed... When!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads!  When!
 Hey... David Wallace!
 Hey, how are you?
 No, got canned last week.
 No, best thing that ever happened to me.
 Yikes!
 can you believe this guy?
 Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
 I will! I will take all of those dogs!
 No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but its not that complicated.
 No, no, no, its about being there for someone after its become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference.  This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference  thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
 Okay! Hope you all learned something!
 Im so ready to love all of these animals. This ones even bonding with me already.
 Stupid dog.
  so it just goes on under here like this?
 Ugh, oh god!
 I am so great!
 This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
  Youre right. hes right, I am a mess. This whole night Ive been trying to convince you guys that Im fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that Im fine, maybe--
 Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
 Yeah, I do. I have that.
 Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
 Morning.
 Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot these.
 You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
 Whats this?
 Is this Roberts attempt to embarrass me?
 Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, theyre rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told its a little much? Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because thats what it feels like.
 Lot going on guys. Whats happening?
 That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. Its like a festival of poo.
  Sorry, not Jim.
 Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
 I forgot, a a pan, uh â€“
 Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client.  I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
 Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
 No, I do not.
 Seriously? â€˜Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
 Im a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
 No. Im a rogue.
 Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now  I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
 Of course they have. Which is why Im giving you a key to my house.  Whatever you need â€“ anytime, night or day â€“ you just stop on by.
 Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
 Yes, yes, yes!
  You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Dont, and I will find another buyer.
 Its just business.
 Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.
 You got a minute?
 I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
 Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
  Hi guys.
  Im- Im good, thank you. And how are you?
 Look, Im not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, Im moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
 Clean the toilets.
 Pull the poop out of the toilets.
 Just, please...
 Please!
 Give me something!
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 I have a delicious secret.
 Yeah, it is actually.
 Mmm, I cant hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three oclock today hes gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
 This is getting more and more delicious by the minute.  Its go time.
 Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
 But its really good-  Oh!
 A delicious moment.
 Well, but it-
 I just want you guys not to worry. Cause old Andys gonna be just fine.
 No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
 Thats not true either! Thats also total- Everyone, please relax. I think youre gonna like this surprise guest.
  Huh? Hold on.
 I just gonna- quick-  Hello? Hey, whats the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... thats not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay.  Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
 Im not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
 Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. military.
 I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
 Stop saying my name.
 Thank you, Erin.
 Erin, come- Come on. You know Ive been talking to David Wallace.
 Yeah, I know.
 What? Thought I heard my name. What? Im the new manager?
 But its- it is- it is me? Right?
 What?
 Oh my God!
 Wow. From janitor to manager?
 Thats quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
 From total loss to total boss, I mean-
 I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
 Guess Id better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
 Gosh, I hope so.
 Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
 It would be rude of me not to let you say whatevers on your mind.
 No.
 Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
 I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
 If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
 All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
 Gymnasts? Youre going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
 Mm. Mm-hmm.
