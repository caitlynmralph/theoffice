 Parkour!
 Do me! Do me!
 Ow! Get off! Get off!
 Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster,  360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.

 What?
 So?
  I like tea!
 Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
 WHAT??
  Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
  This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird.  Almost makes you wonder if its not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course.  But it makes you wonder.
  Did you hear the rumor about me? That Im gay?
 And?
 Do you think its true? Do you think that Im... gay?
  No! But, let me kick you a scenario. Im at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent,  I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
 Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if hes like really aggressive?
 Its not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or its like, not a fantasy, its just... its just a scenario.
  Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
 Women friends?
 Not guy friends?
 No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
 But off the record, Im kinda confused.
 Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
 Yeah, right?
 How?
 Right-o.
 Ohh...
 Alright.  Well hey...
 Congratulations to you.
  Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
 I heard it from Erin.
 Even the fact that Im gay?
  Yes!
 Michael... am I gay?
   What can I do for ya Hoss?
   How are my sales doin?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy.  Youre not buying it, youre good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  Im in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer.
   Oh, Im sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   "Hey Andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha."
   You got it.
   Oh, just backing up and turning around.
   Dit, dit, dit, dit, its not for you.   Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
   Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think youll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
 Thats not how that goes.
 Theres no way that Stanley gets more beans than me.  That is ridiculous. This is how it works.
 Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
  Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...
 What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.
 No... I didnt steal your joke.
  Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  Its like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
 Mmm-hmm. Erin?
 Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smells like my mom.
 Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. Ill break in the bed.
 How did Meredith get put at the young peoples table?
 What? Youre kid-- Thats-- Youre--
 Partay. Room 639.
 Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
 Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
 No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
 If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But dont tell anyone that I said that, cause I want them to come.
 You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
 How about a little bit of this.
 Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!
 I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
 I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
  Everyone else is too drunk.  Just dont let me die here.
  Are you sure this is the right way?
 Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
  I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
  Well its also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
  Ow, ow!
  I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
 No.  No that was real.
  Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
  Well thats not--
  I wasnt telling you.
  Excuse me?
  No, it didnt--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
  It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
 Golf.
 Stock market.
 Dave Matthews.
 What do you think?
 What happened in there?
 Mobsters are!
 He drives an SUV!
 All mobsters have a front, sometimes its selling insurance, sometimes its waste management or sanitation.
 Yeah, buy my insurance or Ill burn your warehouse down!
 Its John Gotti, you idiot!
 Yeah. Its pretty close.
 Already? This, this guy is persistent!
 Yeah right! You heard him! Hes gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
  That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
 Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
 Thats how it works!
 When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
  Dwight...
 Wait lets hear him out, this is interesting.
 Okay.
  I like this plan. Id like to officially withdraw my plan.
 No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
 Well youre gonna have to.  Dwight Well be right beside you.
 What?
 Well if Im gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, Im a mechanic with a tire thing.
 To change tires, no. But its metal, I can hit somebody with it.
 Should I change?
 Well then I cant use it. Im just gonna hide it.
 Oh! God!
 Hi.
 Hmm. Very true.
   You know, gabba-gool.
 Maybe we have a plan for you?
 Yeeeeah.
 Yes I can.
 Okay!
 Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, its probably down.
 You want to do this junior? I didnt think so. Sorry. Its kind of a long day at the... mechanic store.  Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
 So your cars totaled. Uh, youre just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. Hes great. But uh, I cant do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.
 Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldnt give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and thats what Im afraid of.
  It was before, my tech- my technical training.
 Do it.
 Just do it.
 You were man enough to back down Michael, Im proud of you.
 Hes alive.  So youre welcome.
 Yeah, some of that existed before.
 Youre right, that is new.
 Well I dont see that happening.
 Are you saying-
  That we surgically remove the fear center from Michaels brain?
 That seems a little far-fetched.
 No, Michael. What were trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy whos a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
 Class act. Boy scout.
 Hes trying to intimidate you to close sales. Hes just a pushy salesman.
 Whoa. Okay.
 Next time you look in the mirror, youre gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
 You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
 Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
   How may I be of service to you?
   This aurea is a joke.
  What are you thinking?
   Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
  I know, right?
  Trust me it would only make you mad.
  Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
  That is not okay dude.
 WB!
 Industrial P.! Makin cold calls.
  Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
 Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
 Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401.
 Were kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.
  Looks like somebodys got a case of the definitelies.
 Sha-bow.
 Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
 Nuh. Actually, its kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
 Pams carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesnt matter what Pam looks like.
 No I wasnt. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
 Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
 That is our sales pitch and we are stickin to it.
 Well-
 Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
 I love to dance-
 Right. Sometimes Ill just dance for hours in the living room-
 Yeah. We are thrilled.
 In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasnt that fun, honey?
 Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
 Yeah.
 One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
 Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
 Oh, my gosh. Its like hes trying to say, I love you, too, Daddy. I love you, too.
 Message received, little soy bean.
 Well, that went pretty well.
 We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, Id say we nailed it.
 You know what? Im sorry. Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
 Yeah.
 What the heck was that?
 Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
 No. I know Im gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I dont know. It was fun to role play, right?
 I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, Im so sick of being single.
 What do you think of Erin? I mean- shes- I- Shes kinda cool.
 You think I can do better?
 Gotta get my goin out on.
 Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
  Thanks.
  Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
  Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and shes polished right up, back up to her former glory.
 Feel it against your cheek.
  You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
 Whoa--
  Thank you very much.  Now Ive got it for you.
  Is that right?
 Huh.
  That really works.
  Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
 Whoa--  thank you very much.    Oh boy.
   You are very welcome.
  Have a seat yourself.
  Not necessary.
  You didnt have to do that.
  Aye-yi-yi!
 Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
  You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
  Whoa, whoa Dwight.  Im going to do this.
  No, I insist.
  Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
   Ahh.
  Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
  What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
 Its like a little envelope-- there you go.
 Surprise!   Its from everybody.  $15 value.
  I did stand up comedy once.
  Yeah, I killed.
 It was hilarious.
 I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
  I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
  Whod you get?
  Oooooo, saucy.
 Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellies brother.
  Thats clever, Debutante.
  Well, you do actually.  Youve got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin out of your mouth.
  Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
 I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, ifn she dont mind.
   Hey there young lady.
 I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
 Alright, a plan it is.
  Im a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
  Just thinking about Weekend at Bernies.  Its funny, the guys dead the whole time.
  Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
  Yeah, OK.
   Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
  Did you mean a real date?
  Totally... not.
   I didnt do it!
  I am calm.
 Thats aerosol spray. Its terrible for the environment.
  Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael The Machine Scott.
  Hate the twirl!
 Im so jealous right now.
 Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
 Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
 This is your big day. Come on.
 Kay.
 Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
 Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - Americas biggest financial crisis?
 You should get up and say something. Youve got to be true to whats in there.  Dont be a wuss.
 Ive always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
 You wanted to see me?
 Is it serious?   Wow.  Andys a wittle scared.
 Why would people say that?
 Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
 Would you rather me say "Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?"
 "Crazy diarrhea happening right now?"  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
 Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andys sowwy.
 Well if I were complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
 I dont-just people.  For the record, I think its pretty fantastic.
   Tank you Mr. Elwis.
 Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
 The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
 Dont worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place Ive worked has had one.
 Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
 Great!
 Nope!
 Jims talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
 Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.
 Correction.  It was my idea.
 That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
 Oh, really? From what, two to four?
 Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if youre not covering anything up?
 I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?
 Does it hurt?
 Hmm.
 I know, right?
 Huh!
 Yeah! Totally! I admit it! Its me.
 "Seriously?" Are you serious?
 Yeah! Totally serious! Im your Secret Santa! Busted!
 Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that Im her Secret Santa?
 Okay.
 Nnnnya.
 I, I thought that you would like it.
 Well its the thought that counts.
 I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
 Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!
 Great news, Michael. Were now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
 Ok.
 Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
 You sure its saber?
 I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
 Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries."
 The balls totally in Erins court. After the whole drum line thing.
 Hey, any fun weekend plans?
 Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
 Okay.
 Thats as hard as I can hint.
  These sure are pretty dogs...
 They sure do.
 Oh, I do!
 Got some Valentines cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
 Valentines Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentines Day card, but I didnt wanna seem "too eager," so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
  Look alive.
  Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
  Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
 Theres blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentines card.
 Yeah, well its Snoopy and Woodstock.
 Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
 Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadnt noticed.
 Yeah! Its Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
 Its got pheromones in it.
  Its not cause of the smell. Im just expecting a nosebleed.
 Im sorry, I thought you saw me.
 Cool, thanks.
 ...That was weird.
 I dont even know what that card said.
  Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message "Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way."
 Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I dont like-like you.
 "Please dont read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog."
 Its n-- that wasnt... I like someone else.
 Its not... Whether or not, you...
  Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your babys born tomorrow, hes going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
  Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Dont get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
  My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
  Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
  Yes!  Can anyone do those?
  I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
  Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...    Youre clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so Im going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
  A little frazzled.
  Hey, have you guys seen her?
  What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
  I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with todays paper.
  This man has a gift!
  Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
  Yes, Im going to ask out Erin.  Im just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and Id like for the moon to be visible.
  Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guys going to fail this class," or, "Whats this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?"  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted." ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
    Ow.
  Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  Its really important, so Im going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
  The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
  Sorry, thats unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or youre fired.
  Oh, God, no.  Im...  Just read the fax.
  Im...  Im asking you out.
  So, its a date.
  Yeah, what day?  What day?
  Well, that, whats that one?
  Okay.  Lets do it.
 Welcome back Tuna!
 Erin go braugh!
 Thanks. Its actually my sisters old field hockey skirt.
 Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" thats the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
  "The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon"
 She should go home. Its not the end of the world. Well go on our date next week. Shes still gonna like me in a week. Right?
 I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 I have some good ideas...
 You sure?
 Hi!
 Thats okay, Im in my "worky-works." You look amazing!
 It is? Im sorry.
 Okay, thanks.
 Whoa!
 I didnt know you had a brother.
 Well, any brother of Erins is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard.
 Are we rotating seats, or?
 So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
 All right. Formative years.
 Yeah, its a kilt.
 Ooh. Its coming down out there.
 No, I-
 Ah. Oh great, now Im gonna get sick.
 Well then no Andy Bernard per se.
  Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy...  Im making a sale. Sales.
 Give me that
 Me likey!
 Hey. I guess you probably wont give me your leads since Im a jerk salesman.
 Where?
 Are you...
 Are you sure?
 Yeah.
 All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed -
 And Ill text Erin. Shes really good at this stuff too.
 Erin just texted me back. People love shells from far-away beaches".
 Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
  Its freezing out here.
 Oh wow, thank you. Youre the nicest person Ive ever met.
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Oh, baloney.
Ring her up.
Ha! Knew it!
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto.  Are you going later?
Yes.
Whoa.
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but were kinda keeping it quiet for now cause its still kind of a new thing. Its a little delicate, and we just dont want all the drama.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows-  Thats actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Hey, boss man.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Im sorry, I meant later.
For happy hour?
Trying to get a head count.
All right, yes! Its a deal.
Whoa! What is crackin?
Yeah, how do you play?
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Theyd be like, whats up with those two?
Did we miss the wedding? Um, I got it-Ill do this, and you play the racing game, and then well switch.
No drama. Ok.
Did you tell them?
This is exactly what I dont want, the drama. I dont want the drama!
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
 Hi.
I dont normally do this, but...
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
 What are you doing?
We didnt say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Get in here.  Where did you learn to talk like that?
Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
This is not what I want my relationship to look like.
 Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and Ive been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
I know, I do, right? Im a total drama queen.
 Its Secretarys Day. And it is Erins and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers its Secretarys Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 700 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
 I do.
 If it wasnt for secretaries, I wouldnt have a stepmom.
  I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretarys Day.
 Yeah. She really looks up to you. And theres only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretarys Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .
  Thats my girlfriend youre talking about.
  Shes gonna be so psyched.
 So... how was lunch?
 Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
 Well, I know.  Just want... I mean...
 Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
 I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
 Specific shout-out..
 Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretarys Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. Its a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
 Can we talk about this in private?
 Yes.
 Why would that be something to talk about on Secretarys Day?
 I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
 Who cares? I mean its not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
 Will you stop walking for one second? Thats it. Theres no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
 A year.
 Yeah but thats it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
 I didnt see that movie.
 Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretarys Day.
 Well, why dont you just move the M&Ms?
 Ehh.
 You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, shes touching around down there. Its easy to get confused.
 Walk around apple orchards.
 Super romantic.
 How many dates have you been on?
 Mm.
 Of course. Yeah, thats terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
 Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. Its really important.
 Yeah, I dont know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
 What are we gonna do about this?
 Let me know what they say.
 What do you mean?
 I dont know.
 Whats up? I got your e-mail.
 Okay.
 Such as?
 What? You dont know what it meant? How about "Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?"
  Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
 Creeds head of quality assurance. So hed definitely be wrapped up in this.
 Your text said 911.
 Whats bad?
 Oh, God.
 I might have to go public here, but no ones gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
 Yeah.
 There what is?
  Were printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.
 Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if youre watching this, its because Ive turned States witness because Im in danger because I know too much.
 Higher? Okay.  Recently certain events have come to my attention...
 Make it higher? Okay.
  I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
  May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger...  ah!  Its working.  Its... I knew it!
 We are blowin the roof off! Blowin the roof off!  Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. Hes been my partner through this entire thing.
  No secret crying. Hasnt even opened the tissue box in there.
  Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
  How does he feel about it?
  Did Donna tell you that?
  So youre just making a giant assumption. You dont even know the guy.
  My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. Ive lived the part. And let me tell you, Id so much rather play the part on stage.
  So... heres the thing about infidelity.
  How does that work?
  In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. Youre Ali Larter, Im Beyonce.
  Not this time.
  This guys a high school baseball coach, right? Lets go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
  Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Lets go check it out.
  Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
   Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
  Baseball!
  Where?
  Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
   And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
  Whatever. Im the one blending in.
  Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
  I know its like cricket.
  And its--theres-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
  Seems pretty well liked by the team.
  You do know that high school coaches dont pay their players.
  Great game, coach.
  You guys are awesome! Best game Ive ever seen in my life.
  Ha. The other guys can go die.
  Baseball! Go talk to him.
  Shane. Great game man!
  No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
  Ha. No. No. But were gay for baseball.
  But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
  Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
  I mean, isnt marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Lets round you out as a person.
  I get it, man. I love it. Thats what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
  Of course.
  But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
  Come on, get over here.
  Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
  I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
  Do you want someone to stop you? Cause no ones going to.
 If you say anything, so help me God, Ill break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
 So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. Its how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us.  Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
 Uh...
 I, I didnt know. I didnt do that!
 Okay? I, I... didnt do it.
 I swear on the graves of my parents who arent even dead yet.
 I dont care, thats how much I swear!
 I dont know whos giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
 What? Based on what?
 Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
 Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
 Youre going to believe that guy?
 Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
 Look, I didnt want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
 Well, it doesnt make me the worst guy in the world, either.
 Hey.
 Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
