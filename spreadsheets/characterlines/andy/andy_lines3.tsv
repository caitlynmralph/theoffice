 Hey, Big Tuna!  Youre single right?
 Shes pretty hot huh?   Shes completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
 OooOK.
 Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean Im not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?   I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble."
  OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or Im gonna lose MY FRICKIN MIND!
 Why did you do that?!
 Were on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
 Now?
 Put the game on hold everyone.
 Its the new guy.
 See what I mean?
 WHAT?
 Are you playing for the other team?!
 Saboteur!
 Saboteur!  Im going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  Im really going to shoot you.
  Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
 Hey.  What are we doing?   Whats the game?  I want in.
 Did you check the vending machine?
 Did you check your... butt?
 Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
 Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
 Im acting my heart out here.
 Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
 I dont care bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
 We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
 Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. Its very Sam and Diane.
 From Cheers.
 You guys ready to party?
 I said are you ready TO PARTY!
 Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
 One. Two. Three. Shot!
 Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
 One. Two. Three. Shot!
  I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
  I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
 Wait, wait.
 TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
 No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. Youre welcome to share it though. Its a roomy twin.
 Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing?  In your face!
 Mmmm.. suck-ah!
  Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
  Whats up, Josh?
 Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
  Thats the other thing you got to watch out...   Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
 So whats he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite mens magazines?
 Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
 What?
 Ill be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. Im always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
 Hello.
 And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
 Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
 Nifty!
 Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
 Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
 Umm, on the contrary.
 And Im a director.
 Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
 Congratulations.
 Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
 Sure thing, buddy.
 Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin on the charm.
 Hey, Angela. Check this out. Its my new screen saver.
 Do you like it?
 Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
 Youre welcome.
||
  What is love?
 Baby, dont hurt me.
 Baby, dont hurt me!
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
 Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
 Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
 Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
 Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
 Yeah, my Xterras pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
 Actually, it is. Its Latin for "earth."
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
 Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
 Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
 If I were an idiot, Id be driving a TransAm.
  Idiot!
  Nice comeback!
  I am so horny.
 Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
 Oh, and I care why?
 Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. Cmon, trust me on that.
 Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
 Jackpot.
 All... righty, lets get started. What is she into?
 Are you kidding?
 I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
 Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, youre cute. There is no gettin around it. So... I dont know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
 Shh. Think about it. Ill hit you back.
 Yeah.
 I play the banjo.
  You know I can, my man.
 Im gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
 Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
  So weve been told, and some choose to believe it, I know theyre wrong, wait and see, cause one day well find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
 Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
 Michael
 If I may say. Shes even prettier that you described her.
 Hey, whats the haps?
 Umm... Im number three.
 Yeah, but Im number three.
 Hey. I cant concentrate when I know youre in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  Cmon, my treat.
 Thats my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
 No. Benihana. Much classier. But dont worry, the babes are totally hot, too.
 So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today."  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table.
 So she looks at me right, and she goes, "Im sorry, dont I even know you?" After a year, a
 No.
 Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help.
 I think well start with a round of noga-sakes.
 One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places wont make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
 Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldnt do that to him, would you?
 You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell ya?
 This drink...
 Cindy, Cindy.
 I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  Cmon, do it for Michael. Hes had a really long day.
 This is great.
 Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
  They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
 What?
 Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
 My new girlfriend.
 Your hands.
 Ill use my hands on it.
 I am now chopping off Phyllis head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
 Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
 Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot
 Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. Its like we are touring Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
 Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
 Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I dont know. Michael Scott.
 Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
 Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
 Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
 He does your laundry?
 Bueno.
 In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Heres the good news. Every success Ive ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
 Whats the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
 Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
 I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. Its really a pleasure to be a part of it. Its like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
 My plan is taking longer than I thought but I dont give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
 Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. Its in the Hamptons. My dads got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crows nest. Also shot a deer once.
 Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we dont work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? Its in New York.
 Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
 I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
 Ow.
 Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
 I... Im so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
 I really Schruted it.
 Schruted it. Its just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you Schruted it. I dont know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
 Hey boss. Got a minute?
 I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
 Thats weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? Thats not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
 Oh, doggie.
 It sure seems like he is lying.
 Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
 Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happys such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now Im thrilled. So, its pretty...  Hello? Pretty good.
  Big Turkey.
 All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
 Thank you muchly.
 I called it myself. I just thought youd get a kick out of the new ring.
 Side note. Id just like to say Im thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
 I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though youre younger and have less experience.  So heres to the future... Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna...
 The cost of doing business.
 Was the top salesman...
  Addition by subtraction.
 Mmmm. Yeah youre right.
 Hey, boss.
 Noooothin. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
 Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
 Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going?
 Oh, well, Im going to the kitchen, Ill walk with you.
  Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin a lot of face time with the boss.
 Feel ya, dawg.
 Absolutely.
 You said...
 Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it.
 Oh, no.
 I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here.  Whizzzzz.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
  In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
  Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
 Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
 Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
 Whats going on?
 Where is my FREAKING phone?!
 Maybe youre in the ceiling!
  I dont trust you, Phyllis!
 Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
 Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and well hit the tiz-own.
 Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
 Fine. Ill just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And Im also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think its funny to steal someones personal property and hide it from them. Heres a little newsflash! Its not funny! In fact, its pretty freakin unfunny!  Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
 Sure? Okay.
 So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, dont worry about old Andy Bernard. Ill be back. Just like Rambo, so.
 Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
 Its so good to meet you!
 Yeah.
 I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now Im back.  Got a second chance, and Im not gonna blow it.   So look out Dunder Mifflin!    I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, Im gonna hurt you...
 Hey guys!  Guess whos back!  AHHH!  OH, GOD!
 Good morning, Pam.
 Drew.  Im Drew now.
 Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasnt even necessary in the first place.
 Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident.  But after five weeks in Anger Management, Im back.  And Ive got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
 Mornin Jim.
 Good.  Drew.
 Dr--- You can call me Drew.
 Cool.  I cant control what you do.  I can only control what
 You guys...
 Its on!
 Thank you.
 Anything.
 You mean a moon bounce.
 Im gonna need... Im gonna need petty cash.
 Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
 Whoa!  Whats the situation?
 Ok, whens the shunning thing gonna end?
  William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
 Beer me!
 Hand me that water.  I always say "Beer me."  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So hows whats-her-name?
 Who, Karen?  Yeah, shes only one of my oldest friends.   Mmm.  Hows the apartment hangin?
 Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
 Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.   Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
 Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
 So, Tuna.  When we get in there, lets do a really good job, okay?
 Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes its just about the music of the conversation.
 Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
 No, shes a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
 The one in the green hoodie.
 I wonder if shes, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
 Shes like, probably a tutor.
 She probably a t--
 Sh---
 Jamie!
 What are you doing here?
 Are you a student here?
 You never told me you were in high-school!
 OH MY GOD!
 I had no idea.
 Huh... We didnt do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
 Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
 But who
  Pfft.  You dont teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
 I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
 Thats not what I had in mind.
 I dont care.
 Yeah.
 You know what--- I dont---
  Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
 Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
 Sweet.
 What happened? What can I do to help?
 Ill check the web.
 If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
 I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
 This guy looks like a real deviant.
 Aye, aye, Capn.
 Think well find him?
  Halvsies?
 Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
 Yep. If you dont mind, I think Ill hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
 We will be team U.S.A.
 Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.
 Dont worry. Youre not...
 No where near the big rock.
 Whatre you doing? No! See, now were disqualified.
 I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!
  Great job everyone, that was fantastic.
  I am so hungry!
 One came up.
 I didnt win. But the only reason I didnt win is because I recently learned that its better to work thing out with words.
 Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
 Yeah, right, cmon! Cmon!
  Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
 Go tell them Im floating away, obviously!
 Angela, its pretty simple! Look at what Im doing and go tell somebody about it!
 Angela!
  Hello?  Whos there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
 Nice!
 Blup-dup-do. Whats up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
 What is it, Big Haircut?
 Sorry, I cant hear you Big Haircut.
 What?
  I will see you at the inter-view.
 Saving the best for first!
 White, because it contains all other colors.
 You make a chair, but you dont sit on it.
 The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
 Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
 I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldnt you say?
 I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
 Damn it!
 Hail to the chief!
 My first order of business accept.
 Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad.
 Its like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
 This is gonna look so awesome!
  Totally!
