  Im excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
  Im totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
  Really? Cause I havent eaten anything since noon on Friday.
  Ang. Ela.  Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
  Hey, check it out.  This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
  Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
  This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
  OK. How do you feel about Maine?  Im on it. Ill see you later, love.
  Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disneys Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
  I dont know if theres any one place that has all these things.
  Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
  Sweetheart.  Just so you know, I dont care where we get married. Ill marry you right here in this building. Ill marry you in the parking lot. Ill marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
   Hey-oh!
  Why not, dawg?
  Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
  NO!  I want names!
  This is the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my entire life.  I havent had a very hard life.
  Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight.  Its gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
  Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
  Your wish is my command.
  Of course!
  Yeah!  I mean its a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
  And you know what?  The guys already know it so its easy breezy.
  I didnt tell you.
  Here Comes Treble, class of 96 was available for our big day, so, I booked em.
  And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
  Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  Youre gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, thats me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
  Mm-wah!
  Wet Tuna!
 A little close to my engagement there Tuna, whats your game here?
 Hey-oh!
 Ill drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
 Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
 No thats... not how it works.
 Yo.
 No, I did not.  Was that any good?
 Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
 Really?  Huh, thats cool.
 Really?  That doesnt sound right.
 No way, lady.
 Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
 Yes! Yeah.   Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
 Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  Whats going on here?
 Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
 Well -
 Why would that make me a pervert, I -
 Thats not you.
 Thats mean, come on, thats -
 So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
 OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
 Look up here!
 What? Sorry.
 Were taking a picture.
 Shes natures bounty.
 Thats for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. Cause thats what I wrote on your save-the-date.
 J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
 Youre always safe with me. Im a very good screamer. And one day, were going to move to Disneys Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
 Yeah?
  Consider yourself... at home!
 250.
 I need a hug, unless youre gonna give me one.
  Meow. Sweet stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
 Cool.
  We were looking for "kitten."
 Ha ha ha. Thats funny.  Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
 Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if youre not a Cornell man, you probably shouldnt wear them.
 Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
 Well hes had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, youre just doing this to screw with me.
 I know its an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
 Take that down.
 Take. That down.
 I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
 Its pronounced "Corn-ell!" Its the highest rank in the Ivy League!
 Fine.
  Yeah, good. Can we---  Grr. Heh heh heh. Thats Big Red Bear! Thats a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
  You might be interested-
 Dwight!
 Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, its irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
 Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I wont let you in?
  Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
 The conference room!
 Who are your role models?
  If I had to put Dwights chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
 So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. Youre doing great.
 Lets see how well you know your Big Red history.
 Who was Cornells eighth president?
 Mm, Im sorry thats incorrect. Cornells seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins.  Comprehension skills, sub-par.
 What are you writing? Cant even give Cornell your full attention?
 Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
 "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."
 "Applicant is wasting everyones time with stupid and inane accusations."
 "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."
 I have everything I need-
 And you will be hearing from -
 which I will not be a part of-
 And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
 And your affiliation with Cornell -
 Will end completely!
   I thought Id come in casual today. Man, Im hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
 What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
 Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm.  Youre supposed to cook these, arent you?
 Big idea double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
  Speakerphone!
 Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
 I got mine. They were really good.
 Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! Thats my mug.
 Right, well, its mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
  It is a great mug. But its not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
 It has my face on it.
 Dude, that is my face!
  Yeah, Im looking at it right now. Its really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
 I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giulianis first and third weddings. And I got him.  I got him!
  Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top thats gray too? Fabulous.
 So its called the Shangri-La Tent. Its two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. Its just really simple, really tasteful.
 Hobos live in trains.
 Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And its in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
 Done and done-er.
 Do you have a specific place in mind?
 On it!
  Yes!
 I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. Its Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
 We havent decided on anything yet. Were still reviewing some options, and its gonna come down to the numbers.
 Oh. Hmm.
 Thats very generous.
 Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!
 Um, what are we talking price wise?
 Cant argue with that. Dwight ...  You are going to make us so happy.
 Monsieur.
 Im just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation Goodbye my petite fiancee.
 I will try.
 Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
 Ah... sweet!
 Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
 Mmmhmmm...
 Mmmm...
 Thats really good.
 Oh...
 Oh boy.
  Harry and the Hendersons
 Very cool.
 We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
  Wheres the concierge?
 Mmm... bingo!  Follow moi, bro-sieur.
  What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
 One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
  The Huntsman.
 Engaging wings
 Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
 For Madame et monsieur.
 Youre welcome.
 Let me get a picture of you guys.
  Alright, Ive scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
 Come on! Its Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there.  Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas sill vous plait.  Bad decision in a glass.
 I dont care if youre gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
  Youll thank me when they spank thee.
 Do you guys like apples?
 Do you like apples?
 Well, how do you like these apples?  Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude?
 No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
 Gentleman.
 Dude, you struck out.  Theyre totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
 Anything.  You can ask me anything.
 Im your wingman.
 Right-o.
 What?
 What do I see in Angela?
 I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And shes working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin Ive ever seen and I cant wait to have sex with her.
 No.
 Honestly, I dont know what were waiting for.
 What is wrong with her?
 I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
 Too late, too late. Its dialing... now its ringing.  Shh...
 What is wrong with you?
 That was Oscar and he wants to know why you wont do me and I think its a valid question.
 This is Andy Bernard!
 I wanna take you to sex school.
 Is somebody there?
 I have needs.
 Naked.
 Well discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
 Oscar
 That was fun last night.
 You know, its true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
 You kidding me? Its what I do. Get the whole nine nards.
 Totally.  What--- Who?
 We called Angela?
 That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
 Oh, God!
 So bad!
 Oh man, she is so pissed.
 Shes taking us back to first base.
 I get to kiss her forehead.  I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
 Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
 You up for a chest bump?
 Bro hug?  Back to basics. I like it.
 I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And hes delightful!
 So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old mans place?
 Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
 Kaaw!
 Whoa, you havent told the misses about the castle?  Youre in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
 That is just obnoxious.
 No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
 Dwight, Im a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
 I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."
 "Walk until you hear the beehive."
 Lets three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, hows that for a plan?
 Were getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
 Hmm... mm, whats that smell?
 Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
 See? Thats how you do it! Makin progress here.  ...Darn! Heh.
 Okay.
 Okay, guys!
 What is this? All right, were all on the same team. Is it-  Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
 Hey-o!
||
 Im Andy.
 What?
 Are we, uh... are we leaving or what?  Ow!
 Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you.  What-
 Was that hot or what?
  Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.   Theres a place in France where the naked ladies dance.
  Theres a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
 Sorry.
  When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few peoples empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight Bs.  They called me Buzz.
 Whats up?
 Sure.
 All right, everybodys still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise Ive been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.   Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo.
  Sure. Dooo. Tough room.  Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
  Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. Its kind of the elephant in the room, so Ill just...  No one has RSVPed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
 Hmm?
 No, no one has RSVPed, and I dont understand it, and now, youre shutting me out. Youre not even listening. Thats really considerate. Thank you.
  That cannot be true!  Youre going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What Im saying is, I want to cut it myself...
 When what?  When what?
 What cant go on?
 Seems like...
 You guys should... be hearing what Im saying.
 Yeah.
 Will do, boss-man.
 Youre not making any sense.
 All righty.
 Have a good meeting!
  Kick Wallaces ass!
 I cant hear you through the glass
 What?
 Are you serious?
  I need to talk to you.
 I need to talk to you in private.
 Lets go to the conference room.
 Is it true?
 That youre sleeping with Dwight.
 Is it true?
 Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
 How long has it been going on?
 Who else knows about it?
 Who else?
 Oh God. Come on!
 So like, missionary...
 Do you love him?
 Why should I believe that?
 Who says that?
 Wheres Dwight?
 No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? Id also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me whats been going on this entire time.
  Dwight.
 Its over.
 No. Its over between you two.
 You have to.
  She doesnt love you. Shes marrying me.
 Angela Bernard.
 It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
 Im telling you to back down.
 Then Ill make you.
 Through the use of force.
 I will fight you.
 Fine!
 Guess what? Not happening at work.
 Were gonna do it outside.
 None of your business.
 My bare hands.
 Then Ill get something too.
 I will be taking my break at 400 in the parking lot.
  What a coincidence.
 Yeah.
 You give up?
 I am a man! Im a bigger man than youll ever be! I would never sleep with another mans fiance!
 Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? Whens the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
 Go away, Tuna! Im winning this!
 What did you say? Im sorry, I couldnt hear you.
 What? You stupid idiot!  Youre like, youre like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
 I dont get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
 What!
 Im her fiance.
  Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, thats the one.
 Thank you.
 What are you guys talking about?
 Who is the gal in question?
 Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic Hillary Swank is attractive.
 Okay, TMI.
 Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot?  Okay. And all those opposed?
 Whoa, fire!
  It-- its warm.
 Aah! This ones hot too!
 Get out of the way!
 Move it!
 The fires shooting at us!
 Yes!  Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
 Go, go, go, go, go!!
 Youre choking him!
  A throne for your highness.
 Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk Im a womans man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, its alright, its okay,  you can look the other way. Loo do do!
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
 Stanley.
 Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn.  Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
 Hmm? Who? Sam?
 Hmm.
 Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. Theyre catching things that are totally going over my head.
 I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophies mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
 Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I dont think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
 You guys, theyre making out.
  What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, youre the laziest, jerkiest and youre dumber than applesauce. Were stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well its true. Thats what I hate about you. Thats what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
  Sam! Sam!
 I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
 Um Phyllis, whos that?
 For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
 This conversation is over.
 I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
  Trying to see what CDs she got. Its good to know the deets about the girl youre wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes!  Whoa! Aah, Aah!
 Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Lets see. How many did I put in there?  One, Two, Three, Four Splendas in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I dont know how you take it. But if youd rather...
 Well, No, I actually only put in two. But thats not how the songs goes.
 Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you dont even set me up with her.
 We are friends. Stanley, were friends. And you let me down.
 Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
 So Julia, um, lets see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriends house or?
 Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
  Really? Is that... wow, thats so weird.
 Guys, stop everything. Im about to ask out this girl, and Im completely panicking.
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Ive seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
 Okay, it sounds risky.
 Wait, what?
 Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, theres all kinds of weirdos out here, so...
 I am about to die.  Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
 Okay, Okay. Well listen, youre a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
  This is the Nard-Dog.
 Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And Im a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. Youre, like, incredibly pretty.
 Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
 Sure, yeah thats... your right. Its too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So Im glad we go that out of the way. Im gonna be in touch with you. In three months. Im gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
 Take care Julia.
  Sorry I tried to kiss y...
 We lost the account.
 Golden Girls. Thats a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I dont get this...
 No! No! No!
  Youre making it too easy for her. Youre just conveying, Oh I like you just the way you are.
 Well thats not what we agreed on.
 Huh?
 No.
 Youre asking him to give up all of his power.
 You cant let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. Oh I like your dress, but Id like it more if you had prettier hair.
 Thats low, Tuna.
 Dont touch her. Dont talk to her. Dont look at her.
  ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
 Well, its uh, his funeral. So... neh!
  Hey-o!
  Duuudes, stop.
  Stop doing that!
  Cool.
  Im telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
  Why are you asking him? I just told you why hes here.
  For four more days.
  Hey Michael...
   Can I talk to you a minute?
  I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?    Whats that?
  Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, its a farewell...
  I hope I get to work with you someday again.
  Ah... busted. Yes
   Oh.
  No way!?
  In this climate?
  Ehh...  well its a very intriguing concept, isnt it?  Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
   What is he doing? It looks like hes saying something.
  The whole office feels darker, you know?  Its just a sad dark day.
  I know.
 It is 1-3-4, Kev!
 You are murdering the Nard-dog!
 Hey-o!
 My maid died.
 How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
||
 Oh. Oh my God. Im so embarrassed. You werent supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
 No way!
 I hate soccer. But guess who doesnt hate soccer? Charles Miner.
 Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
 Cool!
 Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom".  Goal!
 You know your soccer, man.
 I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
 Im in it to win.
 Get im, Jim! Cmon, tough D, Jim.
 What do you think?
 Thank you!
 Oh, this is awkward.
 Uh oh! Oh! Oh!
 Um, nerthing?
 Pffft.
 The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
 No, thats ridiculous.
 Look youve been here longer, and besides, Im a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
 That was great, but its just sort of, its still a little choppy like. But dont worry, its hard, it took me a while too. Its like
 What? Oh my God you heard that Im so embarrassed. Im like so rusty.
 Really?
 Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
 Better a cappella!
 Yeah. Name another.
 Better a cappella.
 Aw!! Way better a cappella
 Yeah.
 This is my solo.
 Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
 Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
 Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
 What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
 It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
 When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
 I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
 Noishe.
 Thats interesting, because I hear what youre saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and Im like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, Im so happy. Im so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
 And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants.  Ah, whatd you do that for?
  Totally.
 Hey, Jim.
 Bro, I do that all the time.
 Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
 Well, so what?  Your bodys a ten.
 Jim.
  Okay, okay.
 Okay, Tuna.
 Hello.
 Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Heres the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I dont know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but heres the deal, ok? It stops now.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin here?
 Uh, thats not what was-
  Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
 Hey, Boss. Uh, Id just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
 I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
 I dont want to have said that.  But I think its important that you know it.
 I call foul, sir.
  Andrew Bernard.
 What are you still doing not at your desk?
  All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
 Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
 We could write a strong-worded letter.
 I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
 Dijonnaise.
 Me too.
 Thats completely backwards.
 You dont understand clothing, Toby.  Youre dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
  Youre running from the problem.
  Wittle Andy is afwaid.
 Yes.
 Its like a haunted disco.
  Everybody Dance Now", spins in chair] Oww!
 Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
 Im not sure, but Im pretty sure Im in a dance off. Alright!
 This dance competition is not over.
 Yeah. No. Well, ok.
 Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
 I, I - but youre not a professional and Im thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
 Are you sure thats not the "gay" ear?
 Well, I...
 Count to twen - count to twenty.
 K
 Agh! Son of a bitch!
 It was?
 Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
 If-
 Uh...
 Thats...
 ... not what I meant.
  Are you blind?! Are you blind?!  Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? Im concerned you might be in danger.
 Okay, I was just looking out for you.  Youre doing great, by the way.
 Are you blind?!
 Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
 Bump! I bumped it!
  Jim, come on!
 Dwight.
