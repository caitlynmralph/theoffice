 Did you see who did it?
 Isnt that your money?
  Im petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions.
 Hey Angela. Hey, um... Im sorry about your cat.
 Ive walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance.
 Oh God! My nipples, its starting.
  Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.

  Dah!  Come on!
  And this is where I will record your sales.
  And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
  I cant tell if hes mocking me.
  Ehh, cant do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
  Thank you.
 Yes like a chime or a bell...
  Yes!
  Twenty seconds to go time.
  Yeah!
  Website check please.
  Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
  You my friend are in a very close second.
 Okay, uh why dont you just lay off, lady?

  Four!  Three!  Two!  One!
  Woo!
  After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in its path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
  Fifty-two reams!
  Dwight has defeated the computer.
  He beat the computer.
 What do you think of Angela?
 No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
 You hadnt noticed shes a woman?
 I hear shes single and ready to mingle.  Im thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
 Isnt that part of the fun?
 She works here too, how is that any different?
  Okay.
 Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because youre not going to find it in that box.
 Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
 Angela, are you hearing words that Im saying?
 Hello.
 They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
 Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
 Yes I will.
 Excuse me.
 I stole it!
 You said your upper back itched.
 Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now Ive repulsed you, but I like you.
 So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, shes giving off fairly strong vibes that shes not interested.
 But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I cant back down.
  Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
  If you change your mind, Ill be first in line.  Honey, Im still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if youre feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey Im still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that aint no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, thats all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
 I dont know yet, I have to call you back.
 Ill call you back.
 No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
 So.
 Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angelas smoking hot body.
 Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that shes looking, and shes totally not responding to my moves.
 I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
 Yeah.
 Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
 Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
 Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
 Yeah.
 I left a little present for Angela.  I think shes going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
 Best ad ever.  Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
 What? No, why?
  Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
 Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
 Football cream. Grr!
 Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
 Its true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got Nard dogged!
 I need some advice. Ive been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But weve been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. Its just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. Its hot, Im not going to lie to you , but its a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
 Well use code names.
 Thats not different enough.
 Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
 Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say shes Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
 News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
  Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
  Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
 Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
 No, no no no, this is good. You know how we havent really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. Were makin out, Im kissin her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and shes not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and shes like, "Oh D, oh D."
 Yeah. D for Andy.
 Oh D.
 Oh D!
  Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet.  Its gotta rhyme with "piece." Fancy Feast!  Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! Its the cat food. Nailed it.
  Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
  Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin delicious Pam.
 The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, its where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevins band is my safety.
 Fine.  Ill just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book youre reading.
 Why cant I be in the club?
 So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
 Im gonna miss you man, youve been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
 Oh-oh, come on!
 Tuna.
 Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
 Well, Im just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
 Wow, OK, harsh. Just dont expect me to show up.
 Loud and clear.
 Pizza rolls.
 Mushroom caps.
 Hey-o!
 Tuna! Whats up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner?  I bet youre sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna!  These are for you.
 Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
  No its a... hump. Theres a hump.
 Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
 Yes! Yes.
 Michael, youre up.
 Time!
 Thought about it, Im in.
 Yeah it does.
 I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
 I left my cell phone in my car.
 Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
 Its like a ten minute walk.
 Yes.
 OK.
 ...So help us out.
 We wont let you down.
 Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
 Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
 Well first of all, Id just like to say  what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
  I did it.
 Yeah, there it is. Youre welcome.
 Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders hows he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how hes gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how Im gonna pay my kids orphanage bills. That guy shouldnt have to wonder where hes gonna park.
 Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro time. Old ball and chains been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what Im saying.
 Yes, its Eddie.
 By a show of hands, who thinks were a better couple than Jim and Pam?
 Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo!
 Here it is, you should draw a picture...
 Cause that says, that says...
 So much more than words...
  Okay, adjective...
 Good one. Okay, you ready?
  The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"
 What about a cat eating man food?
 What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
 You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and theres an Xterra next to you. Theyre always driven by chicks, so theres your icebreaker.
 Thats a racing stripe.
 Mmm, I doubt that very much.
 How next to?
 I have to pick one of those?
 Can you go over those options again?
 Well I have the, the blue book value...
 Can I think about it?
 Let me think about it--
 Let me think about it--
 Im thinking about it--
 Thinking--
 Yeah. All right!
 What the hell is this all about?  Youre flipping my car for profit.
 I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
 Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding!  Andrew Bernard, Cornell 95.
 Oop, got some blisties.
 Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender.  Its actually not funny at all. Its incredibly painful.
  Giddy up, lets do this.
 People assume Im great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on.
  Dammit!
   AH! Come on, Tuna!
 All right, race to the next hole!
 Shortcut! Shortcut!   Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
||
 Count me in!
 All right!
 Right on.
  Can I have your attention please?  I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I cant think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage?  Okay, then I will come to you, my flower.
 Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage?
 Into the mic, sweetie.
 She said yes!  And the crowd goes wild! Woo!
 Ive been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you dont know when youre gonna meet the right girl and the moments gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
 Tuna!  Im engaged!
 Mr. Andrew Bernard... its got a nice ring to it.
