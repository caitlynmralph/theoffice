 Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybodys favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here dont get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, whos gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin Donuts? Plus, bonus, its really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and hell tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbors house. Neighbors hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
  Hey hey hey! Its Fat Halpert.
  Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.
 So why dont I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why dont you show of your Dundies to the camera?
 Oh, thats a good idea.
 Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
 T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, its just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Dont go there" but thats... lame.
 And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, arent you Stan? Why dont you, ah, show them some of your bling.
 Oh, no you di-int.
 W-why did you...
 Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
  To Oscar Martinez its the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
  He has the award-ah! ...its a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
  A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
 ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
  ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
  Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
 Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
 Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
 Um...
  Could you...?
 Yeah, Im here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
 Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
 ...come on, Jan!
 Youre dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
 Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
 No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
 ...it happens once every billion years.
 Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
 Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
 This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carsons classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."  Heres the problem. Theres no open bar because of Jan and its the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. Itll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
  The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley.
 Pam, everybody!
 Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? Thats what I have to say. Ah, Roys accepting.
  Thank you Roy. Are there any words youd like to say, on Pams behalf?
  Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
 Im not changing that, its the best one.
 Thats why its funny. Every year that Roy and Pam dont get married, it gets funnier.
 Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.
 Yes.
 Okay, well, thats just ridiculous, so just dont, I-I dont have time for this right now.
 Just dont, dont talk-
 Dont talk-
 Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
 Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Cant you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
 Yeah, not bad, right? So lets make this the best Dundies ever.
 "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. Im psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  Youre just a name and number and no one even says hello."  Card!
 "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
 Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
 Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, were going to be doing separate checks.
 I did. And why didnt ya Stanley?
 Well, Im looking forward to meeting Terri.
  Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
 No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
 And I was about to take her bra off...
 ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
 No!  God.
  Alright, so lets get this party staaaarrrrted.
 Um, guys, where you going? Pam, shows just getting started.
 And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
 ...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
 Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
 What? I told them busiest...idiots.
 Well, well fix it up. You dont have to display that.
  Herro everybodeeee. Im gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
  Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
 Right? You know wat Im talking bout.
 This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
 Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
 Yeah.  "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go.
 And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybodys favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down.
 The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
 Um, not everything means something, its just a joke.
 I dont know, its just...
 I know. Its ju- they didnt have any more businessmen. So...
 Just sit down Kelly.
  Its so freakin hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.  Here we go, hes early with the cue. Here we go.
  "You have won a tiny Dundie."
 Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
 Oh, alright, yeah.
 Uh, you know what guys, were just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
  Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
 Lets cut it.
   I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, Im just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened.  This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Dont Go in There After Me" award. Its for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
 There you go.
  Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, well keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
 You know you did.
 And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
 ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
 It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
 Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go.
 Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
 Was this years Dundies a success? Well, lets see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
 Great work tonight.
 Excellent.
 Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
  Hey, whats up?
 Any emails today?
 No? Um... Check your spam folder.
 What?
||
 Kay.
 I am king of forwards. Its how I like to do business, everybody joking around. Were like Friends. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
 Thats funny! Thats funny. Not offensive. Uh... because its nature. Educational.
 Um, I...
 Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, well see. Because I... I dont know if its...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
 Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
 Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
 Uh oh.
 Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
 Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
 Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade A gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
 Really? Here we go! Buckle up. Its going to be a bumpy one!
 Oh, yeah.
 Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, theres a lot of dumb people out there.
 Oh! Wow! I didnt say it! I didnt say it!
 Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
 Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan?
 Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
 Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. Im going to forward it like its hot.
 Forward it like its hot. Forward it like its hot. "Old School".
 Yes, Toby?
 Um... literally two seconds?
 Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So hes really not a part of our family. Also hes divorced so hes really not a part of his family.
 No, no, Toby. No.
 It is a big deal. Its a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
 What?
 NO!
 What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
 There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. Thats why its a joke.
 Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know youre all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.
 I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just cant wait to see how you handle it.
 A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is whats at stake.
 Time to bring out the big guns. Im heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke thatll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. Im looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
 Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
 Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
 Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
 What?
 I dont feel bad.
 No, I dont.
 Okay.
 Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
 Thank you.
 Hi, is it over?
 No.
 I know, I know. Its good. It is not over. It is not over til its over.
 Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didnt because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what were losing? Seriously?
 Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
 Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirls outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
 I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
 No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
 She would have definitely slept with me.
 Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
 What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?
 What if they made out? In front of everybody?
 At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
 Okay. Well, then lets act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! Well use the doll. Pam. Pam?
 I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Tobys video that hes showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
 Thats what she said. Pam?
 Thats what she sai   Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
 Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video were watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
 So you are the lawyer, Mr. OMalley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
 Well, its probably because you dont get em.
 When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I dont come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldnt arrest a guy whos just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
 The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I cant say anything.
 Wheres the line? Wheres the line, Jan.
 No, Ive seen the video.
 No, I didnt.  Huh, what?
 Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
 Mmmhmm. Yes.
 THATS WHAT SHE SAID!
  Come on.
 Mwah!
 You would have done the same. You just didnt think of it first.
 Its... Thats...
 Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. OMalley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
 I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
 This guy does it all.
 What?
 So Im not in trouble?
 I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You cant be too careful about what you say. Mo money, mo problems.
 Okay. Well, lets get you out of here, James. Um... I think were under an hour still, so...
 I know. Well talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
 No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
 Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
 No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
 I dont know about that.
 Well, I have a late birthday and usually Septembers a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? Theres a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
 Yes, your corner. Go.
 Mmmhmmm.
 They didnt get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  Cmere, cmere, cmon!  Come on! Come on.
 Oooh!
 Im not worried.
 You know what? The only thing Im worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
 Times have changed a little. And even though were still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy cant take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
 Im an early bird, and Im a night owl. So Im wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
 Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
 Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why dont you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
 Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
 Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
 Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and theyd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
 Maybe.
 Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
 Sign the papers at the condo.
 Uh, I dont need one.
 I dont need a representative.
 No, No.
 No. Dwight. Im fine.
 Well, this isnt about work. This is closing on a condo, its completely personal.
 Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
 Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
 As my associate.
 No it is not.
 Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because thats the way they talk in movies.
 We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why dont you have everybody work on their expense reports and Id like them in by the end of the day.
 Very good.
 We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
 Good. The Small Business Man?
 Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
 How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
 NO, well can you get on that, because I dont just read Cracked.  Thank you.
 Ok. See you soon.
 I dont know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
 What? No, Dwight. Its fifty degrees outside.  Dont... please...
 I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
 I do not understand what you spend your money on.
  Home, sweet home.
  Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, its this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
  Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? Hed always get rolled over by something.
  Nice to meet you too.
  Yeah, small. Im buying it and Im not renting it. So, its still an upgrade. He doesnt know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
  Oh. Good. Thats good. Its good to be accommodating of that.
  This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
  Im putting my bed right over here.
  Well, then I will get a warrantee.
  Well then I wont get a warrantee.
  So thats the problem, is solved. What?
  Uh... Ten year.
  What? Wha? You said ten.
  Ok, ok, ok.
  Alright.
  Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
  Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
  Um. Im going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
  Oh, man.
 Uh.
  The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I dont... I dont...
  ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
  Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
  As far as I can tell, Im the best-looking person here.
  Theres a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. Its just sorta common sense, because if you are, then youve no place to go but down.
  No, no, no.
  I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
  Ehhhh....
  I made the right decision. Im glad I signed. Im a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. Were having fun.
  Theres something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
  No, no. I insist. I insist. Because youve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
  Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
  Im thinking, lock into a four year commitment, well go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then youre, you know, youre gone.
  What the hell is a terrarium?
  Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
 We take separate cars.
 Why would we do that?
 No.
 EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. Im sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. Im ... Ok.
 Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
 Nobody likes beets.
 Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why dont you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. Id love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
 Stop it!
 Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. Whats going... Whats going on?
 Oh. Thanks. Thanks. Its very cool. Its a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
 You know.
 Really?
 Whats this?
 I dont really know what to say. Um, Im not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
 Get up here, Dwight.
 Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?
 Oh.  What the hell is that?
 Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and hes kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
 Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!
 Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
 Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
 That is ridiculous.
 Ryans about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. Im like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
  Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is?
 Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
 There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
 And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
   Hey!
 Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, Ive heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
 Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
 Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? Thats rule number two.
 So what was rule two?
 Okay, well, lets... . lets kind of take it a little slower.
 Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
 Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
 Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
 Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or Im seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
 Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
 Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. M is for Murder, P is for...
 ...for Phone. What?
 Um, oh, thinking about business school?
 Really?
 So you think you know a lot about business?
 Uh huh.
 Yeah. Quiz me.
 Come on, egghead. Lets do it.
 Quiz me up.
 Uh...
 When I was Ryans age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
  Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, its equal.
 Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
 Okay, Dwight.
 You know what, Dwight? You dont need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then youd know what youre talking about.
 For instance, why dont you go to business...
 Stop. Dwight. You know what? Youre acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! Hes not your five year old brother, Dwight. Hes a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
 I did not go to business school. You know who else didnt go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so its not the same thing. At all.
 Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
 You are so smart. You are so eff-in smart. You should be teaching me.
 I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? Im very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
 Nah, Im okay.
 Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
 Oh, I play this at home all the time while Im falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
 Aaaall right. Whos next, whos next, whos next, whos? Jim? Youre next. Who would you do?
 Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. Cause he is going to own his own business.
 Whos, uh... Whos next? Who we got? Whooo...
 Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
 Whats that?
 Yeah.
 Dwight. Hey!
 Dwight, dont! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
 I didnt say it to him. I said it about him.
  How long does it take to find a cell phone? I dont know either.
 Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. Itll make it easier for him to find.
 I gave it to you in the car.
 I saw you program it in.
 Okay. Alright.
 Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir...
 Dwight!? Great goin. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
 Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they dont teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
 Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
 Toaster Oven 101?
 Hey! I know whatll impress everybody, Ill start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
  ...since the world was turning.
 Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. dont burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
 Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
 Ill give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
 Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... thats great!
 Ohh... OK.
 I know why shes calling. Its the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow Im supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.
 Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
 Well, Im gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said its best to wait till the end of the day.
 I dont know... yet. I will have to call her back.
 Okay... Sherri?
 If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
 Thanks.
 Ill call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
 Okay! Im sorry.
 No?
 Bye.
 I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. Its... these are peoples lives youre talking about.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yeeesh.
 Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing Ive ever had to do.
 Because its very scary stuff.
 Youre worried about the party? Theres a mans life at stake here.
 No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
 And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
 I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
 Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
 Hey.
 You guys excited about the party?
 Its gonna be fun.
  Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
 All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
 Well, you know what? Go buy some more. Ill approve the overages. Sound good?
 Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, Im  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. Im going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
 Well, thats not what Im saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
 Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
 "Bend It Like Beckham."
  Yeah. That would be perfect.
 Well, I dont really have two heads. So...
 Who do you think it should be?
 No, Jim brings in money.
 Eh.
 Its not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
  What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
 Youre right, I didnt even think of him.
 Yeah, thats actually a really good idea.
 Yeah... I could.
 Im not saying thats what he said.
  What?
 That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
 Are you kidding?
 I agree. Hed land on his feet.
 So. How did it go with Stanley? How... howd he take it?
 Ahh, come on.
 I dont wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. Im certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...
 Oh, God.
 Fantastic!
 What?! That wouldve solved all my problems.
  Oh, you idiot.
 If you left, I wouldnt have to fire anybody.
 Big deal. Oh, it wouldve worked out so well. Can you get it back?
 You can call. Can you call em?
 Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
  Can I speak to you a minute?
 Help. Me.
 I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
 Yes.
 I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
 No, no, no. Thats just the first thing... came... in head.
 Yes, thats a good idea.
 Aaaahh! Im gonna kill myself!
 Im going to kill myself, and its your fault!
 Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And theyre saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
 I... this is Creed.
 Im improvising, so just try to keep up.
 And Im very angry, and I want...
 Im gonna kill you. Im going to kill you for firing me.
 Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
 Uh, hey... Creed?
 Could I talk to you for a second?
 You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that youd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
 I... were gonna have to... You... you want something better.
 No, you wanna leave.
 Why... why are you making this so hard?
 I think youre right.
 No, of course  you cant go. We havent even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think youre a great guy, and I like you, youre... youre, goodbye.
 Hmm?
 What old days? What are you talking about?
 Its right here on the desk, yeah.
 I cant, I cant...
 I cant change anything. This is the way...
 I dont... okay, just listen.
 Dont...
 Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
 I have to fire someone today, okay?
 Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, youre always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
 Dont...
 Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
 Well, he...
 Well, maybe I did.
 Huh. No! I cant, no. I cant go back. I would look like an idiot.
 No.
 No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
 I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
 Devon, wait, please.
 Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chilis. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
 I  love Halloween. You know, its just, its just fun. Every year, its just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jacksons boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
 He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
 You look great! And youre a princess?
 A fairy princess. Youre very... .
 Youre a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, thats all yours. Thats all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
  I dont want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
 Uhh, yes, I did, heres the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
  Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
 Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
 Last year they were out of order, werent they Pam?
 Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. Thats pretty good. Um, actually, Im sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
 Is it a priority? Oh I dont know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? Peoples legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I cant because we dont have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasnt a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. Thats the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
 Catch-22. Yes. Why dont you give me your contact information to start with, ok, whats your cell?
  Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
 This is Tito.
 Calling from...
  Pick up.
  This is Mike Tyson.
 And this is more a ying-yang thing. The Michael all cursive, the Scott all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
 Yeah, yeah, I dont think that would happen.
 Because I would kick his ass.
 So? Ive beaten up black belts.
 They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, Im just lucky I got out.
 And after that, nobody ever messed with the Damn Rascals ever again.
 You were a Jet?
 Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some ts and dot some is. Alright, Im going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. Thats my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
 Im friends with everybody in this office. Were all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that arent dentist appointments. And thats when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
 Just hit me. Youll see.
 Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. Thats a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
 Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
 Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented Armageddon...
 ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
 Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
 Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
 Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
 Yeah.  Thank you.
  Go away.
 I havent signed them, ok?
 Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight cant stop you from being mugged. Hes just not tough enough.
 Oh, I could beat up Dwight. Thats ridiculous. I could murder him.
 Oh, so thats what they are saying?
 Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
 Ok.
 Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
 No, Really?
 Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
 Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.
 Really?
 You know what? Youre just lucky that we are at work right now.
 No, they must have class.
 Look...
 Hey, Toby.
 Ive got an idea why dont you leave right now. Why dont you walk away from the room, kay? Fine. Well go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
 I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
 I think it is. A guy told me about that.
 Oh.
 Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didnt have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
 Hey!
 What the hell was that?
 No.
 Alright, thats the way you want it.
 Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
 Im comin atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
 I got his pants.
 Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!
 Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
 You cant see. You cant see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points.
 Open your mouth.
 You talkin to me? You talkin to me? "Raging Bull." Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. Thisll be hilarious.  Oh, were playing phone tag.
 My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
  Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
 He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
  Yeah.
 Yeah, just throw them on the chair. Ill take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
 If youre doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
 Alright, bye.
 Dwight?
 This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
 Well,  busier. Making the time.
 Well, you dont even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
 I know, but Ive been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, itd might help me out. What do you say? Lets gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
 I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
 And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
 I know, I know, I know, I wouldnt be offering it if I didnt think you could handle it.
 No, no, title change only.
 No, no. Three month probationary period. Lets not tell anybody about this right now.
 Absolutely but not really.
 Yes you do.
 And, ditto.
 I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
 Wow, graphs and charts, somebodys really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
 I changed it.  To Chilis.
 Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, Im doing business at the Radisson".  Its kind of snooty.  So.
 Heres the thing. Chilis is the new golf course.  Its where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
 It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
 Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
 Ok, lets do this thing.   Wish us luck.
  Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
 Well...
 No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just dont get very much work done when Im not here.   Thats not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when Im not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.   Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what were gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesnt matter, its an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.   Adios!
 Uh, Ill drive.
 Its just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really dont know Scranton, do you?
 At all!
 You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
 Dar de dar.
 Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasnt moving, you might think she was dead.
 We should come up with a signal of some sort.
 Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
 Well, I... it could be either of us.
 Yeees.
 Hello?  Christian?
 Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
 No Gould?
 Uh, Jan, what happened?
 Is Gould dead?  What uh-
 Wow, youre kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
 When did this happen?
 Ok.
 Alright, after you.
||
 Awesome blossom.
  I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
 Ok, its done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now its done.
 I heard a-
 Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
 Ok.
 Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if its just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... lets see... choo choo choo.
 Pam, its Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
 Yes.
 No.
 Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
 Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
 First guy says "Well, Im an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn".  And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort".  And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, Im a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".
   Yum! Yum yum yum!   Thats delicious!  I love it!
 Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
 Thats why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldnt have to just shout non-sense words.  Thats her fault.
 Did somebody say "baby back ribs"?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back
  Chilis baby back ribs...
 Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
 Oh, so youre not gonna play?  Shes not playing.
 Shes not playing the game.
 Check please.
 No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
 You know?
 Its true.
 Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  Its home, you know?  I know the challenges this countys up against.  Heres the thing about those discount suppliers.  They dont care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once were all gone, they jack up the prices.
 Its bad.
 It, you know what, it really is.
 Well, corporates gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
   See ya.
 We did it!
 Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
 What!?
 Goin. Ok.  Where we goin?  Doesnt matter.  Goin to the go go.  Oh-ok.
 Morning, Pam.  Hey.
 No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, Im, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, Im not, I dont want to go into it at all.  Its off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.
 Hello, Dwight.
 Who.
 Uh, no, no, no Gould.
 This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
 And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I dont think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.   Jan, I defend your honor.    Is that all?
 I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I dont know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  Its, uh,  Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  Hows traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No.   Would you excuse me?  No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no.  This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights were gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I dont understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think youre still a little bit drunk  Excuse me?  Excuse me?!   I think youre, yes, why dont you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didnt slip you something!
 Pam, could I see you in my office?
 Pam, youre trustworthy-
 And a woman-
 And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, its Jan. I guess I missed you.  Ill, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope its understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."  First impressions?
 My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that well be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didnt want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didnt want it, we both didnt want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say somethings mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
  "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
 But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".  That doesnt mean anything, those are just words.
 Ok. Yeah, what, what?
 Ohhh, great.  Well, now Im in a terrible mood.  Lets do your performance review-
 Ah, why, thats great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
 Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, lets listen to that again.  "Michael, its Jan.  I guess I missed you".
 Really?
 God, Stanley, thats frickin brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
 No kidding.
 Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
 Yeah?
 Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
 Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasnt so mutual after all.  Yeah?
 Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
 Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chilis.
 Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chilis.
 Oh.
 Been thinking about you.
 Um, I dont see how thats unprofessional. Just-
 Yep.
 No.
 They are not.  Yes, they are.   Thats my girlfriend.
 Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A "Michael-idea" folder?
 Thats unfortunate.  How bout the suggestion box?  Theres tons of ideas in there.
 The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe theres prizes?
 Why dont you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, Ill tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinsons coming, very soon, and so, were going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
 What did I say?
 Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. K?
 Hi, Jan.  How are you?
 Good to see you.
 Ok.  Ok, why dont we just step into my office?  Were gonna go in here.
 Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous.  No calls.
 Alright .
 Its nice to see you.
 Really?
 Oh, well.
 Alright.
 Yep.
 Absolutely.
 Im a little confused.  Cause first its all like kissy-kissy.  And then its like all regret.  Because "Oh, I regret that."  But, "Wait, Im still gonna call you."  But, but, "Were just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you dont do your job."  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.
 No, no, no, I finished all of that.  Im very fast.  Im not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya maam.  But I do say thank ya maam.  But, Im, Im not like wham-bam.  Not that theres anything wrong with wham-bam.  If its consensual.    Were talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
 This is a business question. Its nothing personal, I promise.
 Are you wearing a new perfume today?
 Well, youre wearing it at the office. And  it, Im sorry, but no offense, but its really sexy.
 I dont understand-  Hold on.  Sorry.   Yes, Pam.
 Im kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldnt interrupt.
 I did not, not, not use those words.
 No, its in like ten minutes.
 Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of dont think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, lets, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"
 Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
 And, um, one down.  Next suggestion "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
 Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
 Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
 Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
 Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
 Ok, I dont know who this suggestion is meant for, but its more of a personal suggestion and its not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
 Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
 Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when were on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think its something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that weve learned this, lets continue.  See, this is good, were learning and were figuring some stuff out.  "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
 Ok.
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I dont think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
 Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
 Ill work on that-
 Lets keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebodys piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I dont wanna have to read these tomorrow.
 Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
 "Dont sl-", ok, thats blank  Dont, just put it-
 I dont understand why youre so upset.
 Let me ask you-
 Ok, let me ask you this.
 Let me ask you something.
 Where did you get your outfit?
 I just dont understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
 Look-
 Oh my God...
 What do you want Dwight?
 Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
 You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
 Why on earth would we give you a raise?
 You do?  How do you get in?
 That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a mans heart.
 Ok, third wheel, why dont you do that?
 That was deer!? Gross, oh!
 Oh, did not!
 What do you say, Jan?
 Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
 Thats from Superman?
 Wait.
 Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
 Ok, so youre saying that there is a different time or place?
 Well, ok, well never as in never ever ever, or never as in theres still a chance?
 I just want to know, from the horses mouth, what is the dealio?
 Am I too short?
 Really?
 I appreciate that, thank you.
 No, I wasnt, I didnt cry-
 So my looks have nothing to do with it?
 Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesnt matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; Im good.  I can go home now.
 Hey, its 1220; where the hells Dwight?
 Never missed a day, my ass.
 It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.   Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend youre not here.
 Theres no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody.
 The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
 Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
 Oh...
 Oh, umm...
 Yes.
 AH! Guh-oood.
 Please dont do that.
 I cant tell you.
 I dont have to tell you anything.
 Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  Im in the best shape of my life.  Look at this.  Brrr!  Thats strong!
 Im not going get a brain-
 Stop it.
 Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why dont you just go... away?
 There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that Ill be reading their e-mails.
 So how do you search?
 Try "profits".  No! Try "Michael Scott".  "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  Oh my God, wow!    E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.    "Sorry I didnt write back sooner; I cant go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."  Well, Stanleys an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
 Oh, no, everybody; Oscars gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That Im a robot?   I will destroy everything in my path-
 Beep! Bop!
 Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.   Oil can. Oil can.
 Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
 You know what the problem is?
 The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think its scary or bad, but I dont. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
 Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jims tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... . No.
 Theres always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just natures rule.  Its intimidation mostly, its the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
 Of course.  Hangin with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
 Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybodyd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
 Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
 Hey there.
 Almost quittin time.
 One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I dont know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya dont, we could hang out.
 You have plans.
 I do, too. I do, too.
 I do, yeah. Big plans.
 Tonight, I cant do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
 Yeah.
 Its the best.  Its the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
 It is. Ok.
  What?
 Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
 Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
 Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
 Ok, alright.
 Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin off to?
 Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
 Liar!
 You are a liar.
 Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why dont we watch that show that youve been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
 Thats, whatever stupid show you want-
 To watch tonight
 Were watching it.
 I didnt know you played soccer, Dwight.
 You, too, Dwight?
  Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
  Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  Im with the FBI.
 Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun.   Thats why I always start with a gun, because you cant top it, you just cant.
 Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom!   Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didnt you?  Didnt ya!?  Well, you didnt, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.    Boom! Boom! Boom!
 Boom! Boom!
 Boom! Boom!
 Why
 Well, if you hadnt stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
 Boring.
 I could of-
 Ok.
 Yehhhehh.
 Im in.
 No, no, no.  Im looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
 What are you...
 Nothing.
 Good, its good.  Good work, everybody.
 So Bernies, huh?  Were all going to Bernies?   Go to Bernies?
 Right, right, right.  Well guys, Id love to go to Bernies with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Cant get out of it.
 Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
 Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  Im just driving by, thought Id drop in.   Theres some wine. I would love a glass, if youre gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!   Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, lets get this party started, ha! Ok?  Wheres that wine?
 Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.    Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I cant explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin on.  Tender love is blind---
 Were making love!
 Talk! Just talk!
 Shut up!
 Funny story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey youre funny, youre the funniest guy Ive ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."   And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
 Here we are.
 Oh god.
 No, no, turn it around.
 Youll break it.
 You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Dont break the branches, Dwight.
 All right.
 Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
 On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
 Merry Christmas!
 Did it work?
 A, thats what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
 Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. Thats what Christmas is all about.
   Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. Im kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
 Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
 It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 Gs. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
 I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And Ill be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
 Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
 No! No way! It... no.
 You wanna be Santa?
 Have you ever seen Santa?
 Okay.
 Well, Im sorry. It just doesnt work.
 That makes sense because he has elfish features.
 You get something good this year?
 Yeah? Who did you have?
 I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
 I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
 Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
 It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
 All right, lets count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
 Not great.
 No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, lets do Secret Santa.
 Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. Its like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
 No, dont!
 Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
 You dont know that.
 I did?
 What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesnt matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
 Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
 An oven mitt? Okay.
 So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitts worth." I gave Ryan an iPod.
 I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
 One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that persons gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose a new gift.
 Well, I call it fun!
 Because its better. Because its more special.
 Shut it. No, its not. Okay, just give it a shot.
 Okay, Meredith is up first. Heres the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten, like the oven mitt.
 Yankee Swap! Thats what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
 I think this is going great.
 Everyone wants the iPod. Its a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
 Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
  I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. Its beautiful.
 Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
 Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I dont know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
  "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
 Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
 Last gift. Kevin.
  What is she so upset about?
 Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think its a success and Im the one who ended up with Dwights stupid paintball pellets.
 Well, I didnt. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
 It wasnt. It wasnt that much. It was $3,000.
 Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your partys so lame.
 All right, now, youre the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
 Cool, cool. Box it up.
 Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
 This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
 Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, its a party. Come on. If I cant throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
 Go, here we go!
 Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, hows it going in here?
 No, no, no, no. Well find some, dont leave the party.
 Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
 Not bad. And if it couldnt go to Ryan, you are the guy Id want it to go to.
 Youre welcome.
 No way. Oh, youre kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
 Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
 Oh, lets fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Tobys gonna fix you up.
 Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
 No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
 Hey, Merry Christmas.
  Lampshade on head! Its happening!
 Yeah, that sounds good.
 Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. Whats better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. Its really the greatest day of all time.
 Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richards?
 Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, lets head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
 Okay!
 Hello, everyone.
 Ah! Ha ha ha!
 Yeah?
 Stanley! Bo banley.
 Banana fana fo fanley.
 Be my mo manley.
 Stanley.
 Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isnt it?
 Maybe, I dont know.
 Well, no. But... okay, dont spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
 Its cheaper.
 This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? Im going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
 It is now time to unveil the destination of this years retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. Its a booze cruise!
 No. This is mandatory. But dont worry, you know what? Youre gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
 Well, this...
 Yeah?
 To throw you off the scent.
 Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
 Well, thats not my fault, okay? Just.. were not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what youre all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
 I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasnt the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And Ive incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
 Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But were all in the same boat. Teamwork!
 Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
 Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
 All right, lets not get hung up on the furnace. This just... its the sales... I see the sales department down there. Theyre in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
 Titanic?
 No, Im Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
 No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. Theyre happy down there in the furnace room. And theyre dirty and grimy and sweaty, and theyre singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
 The... no, no. No, I didnt... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what Im saying is... leadership. Well talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
  A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
 Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
 Id rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
 Okay.
 In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? Its nebulose.
 Hey, look! Im king of the world!
 And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
 Okay! So...
 Right.
 But dont worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
 Im your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
 Rock it!
 If the boats a-rockin, dont come knockin!
 Yep.
 Were all gonna have a good time tonight!
 Hm? Okay. Yep.
 Having fun?
 Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
 Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
 So, okay.
 But before that, I have to do my presentation.
 All right, well have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
 Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss thats always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
 Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
 No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
 Okay, well, obviously you dont know anything about leadership.
 Okay.
 Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
 I dont want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
 Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
 Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
 Then Ill give you away!
 Captain Jack is a fart face. Im on medication.
 Vomicillin. Okay. All right. Its time to be boss. Its time to motivate. Lets blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? Were going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, its my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there arent enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? Its a scary... its a...
 Its a predicament, and its something that each and every one of us has to think about.
 Im in the brig. See? The boats not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
 Is somebody there?
 Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
 He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
 Well, its nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
 Roy said the first one didnt count.
 Really? Youre kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
 Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
 Well, if you like her so much, dont give up.
 BFD. Engaged aint married.
 Never, ever, ever give up.
 Its a fake wheel, dummy.
 Pam! Its Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
 Im hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
 Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
 No, I want you to pick me up.
 I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
 I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up.
 OH GOD!
 Oh God!
 OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
 I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I dont have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, its good for me.  Its the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... thats it.  I dont see whats so hard to believe about that.
 Pam, could you come get me?!
 Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
 Theres no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell em that?
 I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
  No one wants to pick me up!?
 Im not sick! Im burned!
 Dont... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
 I dont want Dwight!
 I dont have a girlfriend.
 It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
 Hellooo? ... Please dont send Dwight!
 Morning everyone.  Dont freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that Ive been through.
 Did you explain why?
 Burned my foot, Pam.
 Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
 Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
 Thank you.  Pam, messages please?
 Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
 No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
 What?
 I dont want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member whos undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I dont think thats too much to ask.
 No, I dont want some aspirin, yeah Im a little fussy.  Aspirins not gonna do a damn thing.  Im sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
 What?  Part of your duties are to what?
 You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
 Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
 Where is my cornbread?
 Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
 Where are the yams?
 Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
 And they had no yams?
 How strange.  Because they always have yams.
 Pam... PAAAM!?
 Come here please.
 I want you to rub butter on my foot.
 Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
 Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
 No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, Im not gonna call Jan.  Shed just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?
  No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
 I fell off the toilet.  Im caught between the toilet and the wall.
 Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
 Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
 No, hes not.
 I just saw him.
 Ugh, forget it.  Ill just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
 Can I have everyones attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, whos supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what its like to be disabled?  Oscar?
 No, never heard of it.  No, a
 Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although Im sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
 Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!
 Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
  I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybodys in there!
 While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
 Good question.  Forrest Gump mentally challenged, Philadelphia  AIDS.
 I dont think so, no.
 He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
 What you mean uh hmmm... ?
 Ok.
 Yes, right in here, come on in.
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
 You are so brave. You are so brave.
 But its hard for you! Right? Because youre in a wheelchair.
 Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
 Oh my God, thats three times as long as it takes me.
 How did you get in your wheelchair?
 Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
 Well, thats good, he still has a sense of humor.
 Well they notice it.  Dont you?  You notice it.  Its the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isnt it?
 Ok...
 Ignore him.  You know what?  Were not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
 Yeah...
 Ok.
 Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
  Hey!
 You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
 Did you get the yams?
  Ok, Ill just have the pudding.
 Yeh.
 You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
 Yeah, baby, I am feelin better.  My bodys literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
 Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
 Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
 Why dont you go with him?
 I cant take you, I dont have my car and yours is all vomity.
 Oh, ok, thats, great.  No, I cant drive.  Jim why dont you drive.
 Well go.  Im still recovering. So lets just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
 Shotgun!
 The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout "shotgun" when youre within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  Thats how  the games played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
 Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Merediths problem?
 Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  Shes not gonna find one driving this thing around.
 Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, Im so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
 I know, just sayin.
 Dwight, what are you drinking?
 Give it to me.
 Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.   Give me the bottle or youre fired.
 Give it to me Dwight.
 Give me the bottle!!
 Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
 Just give it!
 Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!
 Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
 Dwight, what is your middle name.
  Something with a "K".
 What do I write under "reason for visit"?
 Nothing.  I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
 No... you know what Jim, this isnt about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.
 Hi Dwight.
 Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
 Well, you dont have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
 Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
 Ok, what kinda machine is that?
 Thats my joke, damnit Dwight.
 Its ok, theyre with me.
 Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
 Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  Well, see you when you get out.
 Fine. Fine.
 Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Wheres the funny? Give it to me.
 Whats up-dog?
 Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, thats brilliant!
 Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
 Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
 I dont know, nothin, whats up with you?
  No, damn it!
 What does what mean?
 Just forget it.
 Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
 Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin how ya doing?
  Damn it.
 Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you dont have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...
 No, thats not... no, thats not what I was going to say.
 Yes.
 On a Friday?
 I will do all the talking.
 What difference does it make whether your here?
 Hi, Oscar its Michael.
 Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
 Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know its cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
 What are your symptoms?
 Umm, hmmm.
 I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless youre still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
 He sounded sick.
 Thats exactly what I was thinking.
 Yeah. Drop what youre doing. Make this a priority. Because an office cant function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
 Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why dont you wear your hair like that all the time.  Its much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.
 Hey Jim-bag.
 Really?
 Who else knows?
 Wow!
 Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
 My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.
  Can you hear me, they talk about us...
 Hey, whatcha gettin?
 Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
 Any of em?  So, uh, whats the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
 P-A-M. P-A
 No its okay, were talking code.
 Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
 Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
  Peach iced tea. Youre going to hate it.
 Its Grrrrrrape! Soda.
 Not so much.
 Nothing.
 Fact I love grape soda. I always have. Fact Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
 Um, I dont know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
 Ok.
 Good.
 Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin for lunch?
 Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why dont, why dont I take you out to lunch? My treat.
 Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some za. Talk about you know who.
 I know just he place.
  Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
 Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
 Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 oclock. Hi.
 Were not worthy. Were not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
 Im his boss actually.  And I treat him well. Im taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
 Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
 Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
 No, Im gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
 What do you like best about Pam?
 Is it her boobs, or...
 Really?
 Never gets any of my jokes.
 Her boobs, definitely.
 Oh, thank you.
 Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
 Woo! Yeah!
 Thank you very much.
 Hilarious. Hey.
 Just go to his house and see if hes sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
 Just do it.
  Expenses.
 No. Its... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
 Yeah, its a business lunch.
 No he did not. I dont need his permission.
 Uhhh its ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they dont understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
 I put a cigarette through a freakin quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
 Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
 Youre not his friend, you dont know. He is in love with a girl he works with whos engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
 You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
 I know, I know, I know.
 I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. Im just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesnt affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
 Ok, Im fine, no I know, Im good, Im good, its just.
 Yeah Im good.
 Yeah Im fine. Look, about you and Jim.
 No, I feel its my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
 It wasnt that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
 Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. Im done. Thats it. Im out.
 People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I dont, I dont want to live like that. I like it here. I dont want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
 Spamster!
 Hamster.
 Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
 Yeah?
 Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
 I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay.  Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
 Wow!  What happened in there?
 There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
 Is it a bird?
 Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
 Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
 Check it out.
 Check it out.  Dont be a wuss, just get... no, Im not holding your coffee.
 What is it?
 What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
 I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
 How do you know that?  What is it, then?
  Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great.
 That is worse.
   I am a big Fear Factor fan.  Im a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um...    I cant stand it , I cant stay in here another second.  No!
   Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
 Oh... Its ...
  Yeah ...
 No, no, no!  Seriously, I dont mind sharing.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
 Dont ape me.
 This is great.
 The pressures of my office are insane.
 I just... you couldnt understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
 Yeah.
 Ed Truck.   Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work."  What a jerk.  Hes... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
 You know who used to sit at that desk?
 Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
 Yeah.
 He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  Hed come in and sit there sometimes.
 When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office .  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that
 I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
 Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
 Another time, Packer held this guys head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasnt hired.
 Charley horse!
 Charley horse!
 Oh, okay.  Gah.
 Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.   It was hysterical.
  Dwight.
 Lets send up Accounting.
 Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
 Hey guys.
 Ahem.  Whats up?
 Yeah! Oh ho ho
 No, no, no, no.  We dont do that.  We dont do that.
 Watch out, Pam. Youre next!
 Maybe!
 Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I dont know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesnt do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.
 You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
 Stop.
 Stop it.  Stop.  It.   Dont.  Dont.
 All right.
 Hi, guys.
 Im just walking around.
 Well, yeah.
 Oh, and Im not?  Why would you say that? Because Im having fun?  You guys just are workin for the weekend, arent you?  Im workin for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what were gonna do.  Im gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, Im gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
  Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and Im going to ...  ... Im gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jims clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Lets see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
 Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
 God, this is gonna be fun.
  So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that!   Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  Thats my sale!
  Nothing.
 No.  Just ...
 You know what, guys?  Its none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
 Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
 Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
 This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.
 You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  Were... were not... were not doin this today.
 You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and Ill explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
 I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what Im talkin about.
 Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, wed be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.
 Youre all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly.   No.  NO!
 Do you remember Ed Truck?
 How would I know?
 My biggest fear is turning into him.
   I wasnt talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
  Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin back.
 Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really dont wanna be up there right now.
 Oh, no, no, no.  Youre good.  It was clerical.  Youre good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
 I didnt get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
 Really?
 Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
 Well... s-sure I can.
 Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
 Well, okay.  Different management styles.
 Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I dont have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney."
  Yes.
 Who is this?  How did you get this number?
 Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin?
 Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
 Really?
 Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
 Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
 Are you kidding me?  Oh!
 That was Packer!  Oh, youre... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
 Oh.   Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
 It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I dont expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  Its ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun.  We just have fun!  Oh, Im just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
  Hey, whats going on?
 Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
 Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that todays woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
 No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
 They did this up in Albany...
 And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
 Well, Im their boss, so I feel like...
  Anybody want any coffee or...
 Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. Women of the workplace. About what? I dont know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
 Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. Youre a guy... too... sort of. Lets do this!
  Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Lets just clap.
 Lets just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!
 Thats what Im talking about!
 Just having a little guys in the workplace thing.
 Why cant boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
 We have nowhere else Jan. This...
 OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? Theres another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, theres another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real mans work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
 Oh, I think its going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I havent been there in months.
 So lets meet the warehouse! Lets get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
 You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. Theres Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, shes our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
 Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
 Roy and Pam. Its a Ram. Its a Ram thing.
  Uhhuhhuh. Just in case theres someone down here who shouldnt be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I dont see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
 Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I dont think... You.. Youre... My job sucks compared to this. I dont think youd like it up there.
 Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
 Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
 Hey, youre going to, going to hurt yourself.
 Stand clear.
 Im fine, Im fine. Im fine.
 Oh, oh, oh!  Well get somebody to clean that up.
 We ought to have this thing serviced.
 So! Guys gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. Thats going to happen, you know. Were guys, so...
 No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
 Stay or...
 Lets start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
 OK.
 OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
 I... That was just...
 I was breathing.
 I hate shushing. You know, thats the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
 OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. Thats what guys do... and we love it.
 I feel you.
 Yes.
 Ah, you do. So...
 I know. God! What is that?
 It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
 No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
 You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
 Dockworkers?
 Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
 The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
 Yeah-es.
  This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
 Dont get hysterical.
 Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
 Lets... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
 Dont talk to me that way please. Just... theyre going to want to hear this from you.
 But were bonding down there!
 I mean I just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear.
 Ok. Come on Jan. After all weve been through...
 We have a history...
 ...between us.
 I wont
 Im just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
 Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
 Hi.
 Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
 I have essentially. Yes. Ive taken some...
 Im just going to put this over there.
 You did uh... okay.
 Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
 Hey. Um... look guys, Im sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
 Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
 Thank you to our hosts.
 Ahhh! Excellent.
 Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
 Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
 Nope. The opposite of that.
 Ok, good.
 I probably will, why do you ask?
 Yeah.
||
 This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentines Day. Its New York. City of Love.
 Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
 Alright.
 Dude, Im gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
 Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
 The meeting isnt til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And Im gonna go get me a New York slice.
 Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when youre in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, thats pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
 Everybody takes the subway in New York. Its fast, its efficient, gets you there on time. Its a way to  Okay, theres a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
 This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and its, thats Tina Fey . Thats Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, Im sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasnt. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
 I would love to live in New York someday. Its a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. Itd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, thats either the Hudson or the East, so were back,  should be back this way. Theres a lotta pressure on me right now. Its like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as its over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Lets do it.
 There they are. Whats up? Hey hey.
 Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
 Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.
 You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
 So whats going on? What I miss?
 Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...
 Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, thats not. Cool it.
 Maybe because shes my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. Shes... we hooked up and...
 You know, months ago, just once, Its, just stupid. Just forget it,
 Yeah, yeah.
 Ditto.  How are you Jan?
 What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.
  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And thats the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, were not just in the paper business, were in the people business. Lets meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanleys dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business were hoping to build our bases on.
 Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably wont. You know, not what this is about.
  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What its like to walk a mile in Oscars shoes. Or try on Phyllis pants.  Maybe even one of Angelas famous brownies. And youll know, that youre home.
 Questions?
 Yes, thank you.
 Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...
 Oh, ok. Alright.
 No youre not.
 Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
 Yes. Im sorry. I will fix this. Ill talk to him. Ill talk to David.
 I am serious. And dont call me Shirley. Airplane.
 No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, heres the deal. Its my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.
 I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, hes not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
 I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, Im really sorry. It will never happen again.
 Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
 Yeah, Happy Valentines Day.
 Oy vey... schmear.
 Lets think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
 Could go either way. We dont know what they are going to say.
 Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
 No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I dont like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
 Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
  Hey, Dwight.
 You all right Ryan?
 Pam!
 Thats what she said!
 Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
 Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
 Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, youre awesome! Heres a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Heres a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
 That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
 Thats because youre incapable of doing it because you dont know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, theres no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
 But I can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company.
 Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
 Dont. Dont try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
 Insult.
  But seriously, whats the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
 Its a joke, Dwight. Its not a Sex Ed class.
 Yeah, youre right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
 I do. Both of them.
 No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesnt matter what you say. It just matters that youre saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
 Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
  Congratulations.
 You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
 No, no! Its not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. Theyll eat it up. Theyre a great audience.
 Hes kidding. Dwight was kidding and I dont know why because it wasnt funny... and it was just horrible.
 Yeah.
 All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Lets go. Lets do it.
 As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. Were all going to go around the room and were going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
 Pam! Im public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
 Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
 Oh ho hokay. You know what? Thats not a toast. Youre not standing up.
 Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
 Well, its mostly made up. So...
 Dwight is not going to do a job. Its sad. And theyre expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
 Confidence, Dwight.
 Its time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
 All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. Its a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. Were down here. Right.
 Dwight, they called your name.
 All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. Im going to cover for you.  All right!
 Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
 Im very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the Police Academy movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?
 Car starting.   All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
 Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
 I got thirsty. Howd it go?
 You would not believe what happened here.
 Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
 Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like I dont have my ID, please give me one. And he was like I cant do that. I cant serve you.
 She might have been. So she says Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. Ill show you my ID. She hasnt come back yet. Shes probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
 Dwight gave a great speech. Thats the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
 Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
 ... Oh, God is that today?
 Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kids environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what Im going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still.
 Well, Ill be in my office.
 Theyre cool.
 Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. Im Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, whatll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
 Okay, Im Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
  I work with a bunch of nerds.
 Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, youve really grown up. You know what? Dont mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
 Oh.
 Yeah, middle schools amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
 Its not that children make me uncomfortable, its just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? Ive never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
  They want how many spiral pads?
 Okay.
  Just compare last years order to this years. Uh-huh. Yeah, Im looking at it right now.  ... Yes. We--yeah, theyre very--theyre different.  Yeah, we can stick with last years, youre just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
  Yes. Well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? Ill call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. Thats--- thats alright.  Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My names Michael. Whats your name?
 Nice to meet you.
 Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like Im the conductor.  But Im sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?
 All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!
 Dwight! Dwight!
 What the hell are you reading to them?
 Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids dont want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
 Whats a Nazi?
 Dont!
 Dont! Dont! Dont talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? Theyre going to have nightmares, so why dont you just shut it?
  Why dont you just leave? Okay?
 Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
 Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.
 This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? Thats paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
 No, we dont actually cut the paper. Thats a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
 Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
 Im not just a middle... man...
 You are describing Office Depot, and theyre kind of running us out of business.
 ...Theres Creed! Lets take a look at what hes doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
 Say hi to the kids.
 Yaaaaay.
 What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
 No no no, were not gonna see--- were not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
 You know, theres something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
 Its true. I did.
 I am totally serious. There was a show called Fundle Bundle and I was the star.
 Its true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mothers house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled Fundle Bundle. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
 I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
 Oka--
 Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
  Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
 I dont get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... Theyre adults, for Gods sake.
 I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called Fundle Bundle. Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
 That... is Miss Trudy. Cant tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
 Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
 Yeah.
 Uhh, I dont know.
 Can everyone please shut up, please! So you dont miss it.
 Oh! Thats me. Shh. Shh.
 Coulda sworn there was...
 ...uh, no.
 Uh, just never happened.
 Uh, nope.
 I do okay.
 Yes.
 Okay! Alright, okay.
 ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and Im going to go do my work. Bye.
  Yeah?
 Oh, thats okay, she can keep those.
 Thank you.
 You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
 Well, sure, playing the field is great, dont get me wrong, but theres more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
 Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
 What about...
 ...Jan. Kay.
 ...Or biologically.
 Thanks, thats, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
 Oh... kay.
 Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
 Hey, uh, no, please? You cant leave yet. Theres still one more thing we need to do.
  You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
 One more time.  You...
 So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
 Dont worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
 You know what? Thats a nice attitude, Ryan, Im just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
 Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
 You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
 Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money were all going to make. Its not a pyramid scheme, it is a... its not even a scheme per se, its...  ... I have to go make a call.
 Oh ho ho! What?
 Thank you! Thats really nice.
 Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I dont know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
 Whats up?
 Ah, thank you sir.
  Yeah.
 Ohh, god.
 No no no, no, new suit, please.
 Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
 Good luck. One of a kind.
 Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  Theyve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
 Dont! Nope! Please, dont want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
 Lets get the party started.  Not the way I taught you!
  Yeah?
 Oh, great, put her through.
 Hey, you.
 It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
 Really? Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
 Thanks.
 Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
  ...You can take a five, if you want.
 Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
 Thanks.
 Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
 You didnt know it was my birthday.
 Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
 Mmm.
 Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
  Okay. Im so nervous.
 When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
  Stop it. Stop! What is that?
 Yeah, well, its on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
 Youre making it worse. I bet Luke Perrys friends dont treat him like this .
 What?
  Ohhh, God.
 Ohhh, no.
 Ohh, no, no, no! I cant... Ryan, come on. Lets do this.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
 Get in here... everybody.
 Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
 The best.
 Yes.
 Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
 Just the bread, its fresh baked.
 Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
 When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasnt even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
 Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
 Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
 Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
 ... I asked for trick candles.
 Okay. Well, when she comes back well do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Havent had a hug all day.
 ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, thats good timing. Thats... thats, sorry, thats terrible. Terrible news. Thats terrible... terrible news for both of us .
 There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
 Yeah, but its not brain cancer. And it shouldnt stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
 And laughter... also.
 Why are you here? I didnt even invite you to my birthday party.
  Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesnt speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
 Well, youre pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
 Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, were going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
 How dare you sir. You are gross.
  That should not be there.
 No, its alright. Its already up. Just leave it. Wheres Kevin? Come on! Lets get our skate on!
 Yeah, Ive been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, youre on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
 Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, its pretty scary. And Im thinking that uh, next time youre in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
 Kevin. You heard anything yet?
 Okay. Well. Live strong.
 Alright.
 Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
 Oh, these... all your kids?
 Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
 Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin now!
 Push. Good! Thats great. You got it.  Excuse me.
 Oh... God...  God!  Were gonna beat this, okay? Were gonna... come here .
 Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
 Okay, whos this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
 Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
 Thank you... Dwight. Thats great. Thanks.
 Yeah.
 Oh! You didnt need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
 Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, youre totally harshing the office mellow.
  Narc!
 I wasnt attempting to compliment you.
 Uuf, well...
  Okay...
 Why dont you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, wheres my office?  I totally lost it, cause I was half-baked. Smokin doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
 Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
 Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Whos he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
 Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, whos in trouble?
 Waa... what? What are you talking about?
 Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I dont know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and Im sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
 Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
 I can do that, it is my office.
 It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
 No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, hes right? What hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
 I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
 Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
 Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
 Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
 Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
 Yes it is.
 Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Tobys urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
 I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
 Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? Im going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
 Really?
 Jim its okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  Its okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, hes doing it, okay.  Its okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.
 The point Im trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all dont quite hate em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
 Yes, I will not be.
 Okay, well Dwight just know that Ive been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasnt planning on going to the bathroom and I dont even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
 So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
 Just forget it.  Just the urine.
 Just. I need your urine.
 Yes in a cup, were not animals, Dwight.
 Its none of your business.
 Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
 I need clean urine for the lady.
 Dont think of it that way. Its like, urine goes all over the place. You know, theres no controlling it. It just... goes
 A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
 No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
 Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
 Whats wrong? Wheres your costume?
 Why?  Wha...
 Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and Ive decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
 Yes, sir.
 So you wanna? Thanks.
 Okay.
 Good.
 No. Oh. Uh...
 Alright.  Well, Thank you.
 Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sams. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. Were doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
 Thats a nice tie.
 That is... who makes that?
 Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
  Whats the dealio?
 Whats the problem?
 So what, youre having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
 Yes.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
 Okay... what?
 Yeah, well... thats not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we dont get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
  A mediators tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
 No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
 Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
 Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
  Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
 Come on, seriously, that?
 Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
 Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
 Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
 Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
  It is done!
 Yes.
 Are those all the other complains?
 I would like to see those please.
 You cant do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
 Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
 Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
  This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
 You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
 How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
 Thats what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
 Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
  All right, Pamela. Come on down! Lets do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
 Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldnt she do that at home?"  Who else? Why dont we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
 Here is a Kelly complaint "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.
  Makin progress.  Yes?
 What?!
 Stanley.
  You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
 Someone complained that the mens room is "whites only". Stanley, you know thats not true.
 Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angelas giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
 And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
 Oh... ok.
 Okay, well... all settled, then.
 OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
 All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
 Uh. Dwight.
 Okay! Calm down.
 Hey, hey!
 Stop.
 Okay...
 Dwight...
 Stop...
 Oh... kay...
 Okay.
 Yes.
 Mm-hmm.
  You know your I.D. says youre a security threat?
 Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
 Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didnt work, everybody would still be in the cage.
 Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."  "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
  "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."  "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the womans room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."  Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
  "Every time I typed my name, it said Diapers."
 "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
 The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. Ive never had one. They sound awful.
 Hey, theres like, 300 more of these. Lets get to them later.
 Maybe, I havent decided yet. Lets get to work.
 Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrows not good. How about later in the week?
 Good. Okay.
 Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while youre here?
 Well... thats... what, a computer camera, right?
 Itll take like two seconds.
 Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
 Come on, everybody.
 We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
 Good, lets check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. Well take one more.
 What?
  You just press the button.
  Okay, good. Check that out.
  Thats terrible.
  Lets pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.
  It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
  One, two.. Didnt say three, did I?
 But, Im sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You cant outrun your problems.
 And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But heres the thing about cage matches sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
 Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know its illegal in Pennsylvania, but its for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. Its just... Its nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good.
 I try not to think of it as lagging behind. Its more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
 Top 80 percent!
 Yeah?
 Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
 Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but were having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
 I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
 Oh, come on. Come on.
 You know, itd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
 Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but weve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
 Okay, everybody. Tonights event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
 Well, they need our money. They dont have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
 Well, Oscar, if you dont like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
 So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
 Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
 Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
 Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? Were gonna...
 Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesnt exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
 No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
 What?
 Thats a dog.
 Thats a shawl.
 No. Humans with AIDS.
 Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
 There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. Its one of my dreams.
 I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
 Its Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
 Well, actually, its my warehouse.
 Why are you here?
 Not. I said, not that.
 Thats ironic.
 That you are afraid.
 Dinkin flicka.
 Give me some.
  Yes
 Who?
 Do I know a Carol Stills?
 Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
 Hi, Carol. How you doing?
 Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
 Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. Its okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
 Actually, Im sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
 Yeah, itll be good. You know what? Why dont you come by? Bring the papers, Ill sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
 Yeah. Itll be fun. What do you... What do you...
 Oh, Im sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
 Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
 Hey, Jan. How you doing?
 I am?
 Oh, okay.
 AIDS.
 Okay, sounds great.
 Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
 Right.
 Yeah?
 What?
 Okay.
 Problem. Good.
 Good, All right. Sounds great.
 Bye.
 Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
 Hey, hey.
 Hey, Carol.
 You look great.
 Oh, well... Kiss.  Thats how we do it in the paper biz. Its European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight
 Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
 Okay.
 Billy, your nurse is hot.
 Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
 Chilis is great.
 Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
 Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Lets get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
 All-in.
 Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because Im not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
 What are... Thats insane.
 Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesnt that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So dont be stupid. Just take it back.
 Okay, all right, whatever.
 You really screwed that up.
 Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck werent involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 Jan.
 Look, okay, I think were all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
 After you said you werent coming, I invited Carol to come and I dont think that I did anything wrong.
 Um...
 Hey. What...
 All right!
 Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!
 Yeah!
 So close. So close.
 Hey, okay.
 Thank you.
 Okay. Thanks for coming.
 Okay. Talk to you Monday.
 Good night. Shes a good boss.
 Oh, shes great.
 Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, Ive got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
