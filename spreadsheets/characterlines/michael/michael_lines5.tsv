  All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.
  This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
  Dwight, Dwight!
  No, I will ex-squeeze you.
  OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
  Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
  Jimbo.
  Did you see Hollys butt?
  Why?
  I know.
  I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that shes allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
  And that her butt refuses to quit!
   You have to agree with me.  Thats insane.
  I thought you had to pee.
   Hey, hey!  Pam, Pam! Hey!
   I wrote you a goodbye poem. Its really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
  No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
  I took a lot from other poems.
  All right, call--
  OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
 Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Lets move that up. Here we go.
  All right.
  All right!
   Im MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. Shes DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
  Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Whos your daddy? You dont know who your daddy is, do you? No, you dont.  Come on. Lets go in.
  No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Dont we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
  Pam, Id like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
  Oh, calm down, weirdo. Its just a joke. Shes such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She cant find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
  Lets go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
  OK, everybody, lets suck in our guts.
  Damn it. Come on.
  Here we go. Everybody on.
  Hows it going?
  Good.
  Cake? Who suggested cake?
  Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
  What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.
  Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
  No.
  Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we dont follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
  Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
  If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
  This is how were gonna do it. Five pounds. Im asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jims 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
  Booty call.
  Here.
  Wait a second.  I dont want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
  You want more?
   Its a pretty lame party.
  You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
  Lets go mini-golfing.
  Uh...
  Um, I think youll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
  You know what? Were pretty much done here today. Why dont you just take off early?
  Yeah.
  Good luck.
  Oh, Holly doesnt need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
  OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
  And what is that?
  You know, were gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
  Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.
  I did!
  Yes.  Gooooo-tee!
  Hey, you know what?  I cant do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
||
    Mmm--- mmm...  Um...
  Close the door.  This is your fault.
  Your stupid friend zone.
  I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
  Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.
  Gah, the dreadmill.
   Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
  I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! Ill take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
  Its my sumo suit.  I just didnt inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
  Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
  If its me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
  How do you know Michael Clump?
  How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
  No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why dont you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
  Hey!  Why dont you just sit down, please?
  Were doing this because of you.  So why dont you just go stand somewhere else.   Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
  Why?
  Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
  Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
  Youre right, youre right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
  Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why dont you have a seat?   Lets all clap at Phyllis.  Ok!    When Michael Clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.    Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go.  Ok, I want you to look at her.  Shes a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
  Ok, be more specific.
  What about her looks?
  Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
  I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.   Mmmmmm.
  Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
  Ahaha, Yep!
   Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
 Hey!
  Excellent!  Good job.
  Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?
  No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
  I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  Hell call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, hell call.  If he doesnt, he is loco.
  Ugh.
  Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
   Hey, is that healthy food?
  Were trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
  Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
  Aww, really?
  I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
  ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
  I know.  I love Counting Crows.
  Wow, really?
  Thats a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
  I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
  Ok?
  Alright.  Alright!    Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
  Is that good?
  OK.
  Darryl, would you do the honors?
  Nonono, no, no, I dont want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I dont care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
  Whats going on?
  To be married?
 WOO!  Alright!
 "Why are you helping her?  Youre not even dating."  Shes my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
 Ok, lets give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!
  Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, youre a good guy.
 Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
  Cant set em up like that.
 Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
 Yeah.
 Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
 Do you... just... youre kind of losing them.
  Lauren,  enough with the pencils.
 I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
 Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
 I will go first.  When I discovered
 To tell you or not.  And Im glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
 Yeah, .  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
 A siesta!
 You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
 Who hasnt?  Good.  Good!  What else?
 Mmm...
 Well, lets keep this party movin on.
 Bruuuuuuuuuce.
 Ach! Wuh---
 Thats crazy.  Thats crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got?  You know what?  Thats a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Whos to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, lets give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work.   Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
 Oh...
 Meredith, why dont you tell Holly... its not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
 No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
 Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  Its a miracle, youre at your desk.
 Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  Youll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and theres no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people cant, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
 Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
 Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.    Sorry!  You know what?  Lets go out!  Dunder Mifflins treat.  Um, actually youre not a client... so... well just split it?  Ethical.
 What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
 Istnt it?  Yeah, its kind of... business/romantic.  So youre from Des Moines?
 Wow, that sounds so... warm.
 Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
 Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  Its just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
 Wow, terminator, terminator.
 Yeah.
 I just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
 Ok, new idea.  We dont report it at all.  We just punish her.
 Mmhmm, tell her she cant have sex for six months.
 I dont know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
 No, its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
 I am just saying that I dont think that you understand what I am saying.
 Yes.
 Well... bleh busted.  I dont...
 Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
 I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I dont want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers.
 Whats the only thing worse than one HR rep?
 You get me.
 I dont know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
 Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
 How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so."  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like its a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
 Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
 Get in there right now or Im gonna lose it!
 Now is really not the time, Meredith.
 Yeah.
 OK, just remember to keep breathing.
 OK, good.
 Oh, OK! OK!
 I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
 I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
 I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
  Andy, would you like to have my baby?
 All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
 Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
 Aaaaaaaa!
 Just keep pushing...
 Im right here.
 Im right here, Im right here.
  All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
 Shhh. No, you cant have it.  Its too late.
 No.  You have to just push it out!
 Keep simulating.
 OK!
 Keep simulating.
 Yes, I do!
 OK.
 Yes.
 Aaaaaaaa!  Its coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
 Nice touch.  Good.  Lets try that again.
  It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
 Hello ladies, hows my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
 Damnit, Phyllis!  Im sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
 She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
 I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if Im not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, wheres my golden shower, Phyllis?
 It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. Its like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... its so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
  Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Dont talk to them.
 Make the party.  Dont - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
 Ahoy, matey.
 Ahoy. So, how you doin?
 Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  Its all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while shes here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And Im treating Ryan the same way.
 So this is Astird.
 Oh, OK.  Why didnt you call me?
 I could have helped.
 Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
 No, I dont!
 Can I hold her?
  All right, OK.
 I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think its because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst...
 ...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  Youre going to know them for the rest of your life.
  Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go.  Lion King!
 OK, come on, lets get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
  Im fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
 Ready to play some games? Lets do it!
 Uh, duh.
 No, the baby doesnt ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Lets just do what you were going to do.
 All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
 Whatta we got?
 Oh!
 She already has a stroller.
 OK, what else?
 Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
 I could have helped.
  Uh, yeah.
  I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
 Phyllis?  Could you take-.
 Hey guys.
 Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
 Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
 I just saw this baby daddy-
 Why, Darryl, because Im quote white quote unquote?
 Well-
 Its- thats different.
 Thats not a baby.
  Could I?
  I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
 Sure you cant stay a little longer?
 All right.  All right, everybody, were leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
 OK?
 Wha - thats, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, cause I dont, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
 All right.
  You wanna go out?
 I didnt feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
 Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
 Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
 Hey.
 That was really fun last night.
 Im actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
 Yeah?
 Oh really?
 Well...
 I, uh...  I let her win.
 So, when, um, can I see you again?
 No.
 Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonights no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
  Why?
 Wow... Oh, wait a second, I cant tonight...
 Tonights so...
 Too many times. Its all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
 Youre welcome.
 In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I dont know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me Ill know for sure.
 Yeah.
 Some of what we order depends on whether were having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think were going to have sex tonight?
 Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... Well just do the restaurant thing first.
 Probably get soup or something light.
 No. No. Reservations are at 800, so weve got like an hour and 45 minutes.   Im a crazy eight, Im crazy.
 Do you need em?
 All right.
 Thank vous.  What? Oh!
 Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they cant hear us at all.
 Were totally alone.
 Oh, my God, what happened?
 Yeah. Oh... oh!
 No, did you?
 Oh, no, my God.
 Oh my God!
 So much for sex without consequences.
 Were gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
 To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. Im calling it crime-aid. Its like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
 Thank you.
 Okay, Im gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didnt get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
 Okay. Okay! Well, come on, lets have an auction. Lets do this. Well auction off people like in the olden days.
 I dont know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. Theres a point there. But what is the point? I dont understand what hes saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, its not a little foggy theres actually something going on here-
 Do I?
 Yeah, I think thats pretty boss.
 Whoa!
 Twice. ... Right?
 Mm-hmm.
 Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.  And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.  Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? Youre auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
 Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga!

 Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, Im actually going to bid on this. Im going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
 Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you dont win it. It just says "Creed."
 Lets hear an opening bid, everybody. Whos first? Kevin do your taxes. Hes the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
 Federal and State.
 Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.

 Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cats Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
 When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
 Road trip!  Right?
 Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
 Were not.
 Were not doing anything.
 All right everybody. Im out of here. Jim, youre in charge.
 Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
 You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
 Cool!
 Were gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes well just meet in the middle. Itll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
 Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!   Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
 Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
 All right. Whats the scoop, how far?
 Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
 Yeah. I dont know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
 Here we go, fourth times a charm. "Lifes like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you dont, sometimes you do, what you want... theres a world out there....  Hey. Are you crying?
 Allergies?
 Did Darryl touch you?
 Whats the matter?
 Sure it is.
 Oh no no no.. Its gonna work, itll be fine.
 Listen to me. I like you so much.
 And Ive dated four women in the last--
 Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
 Ive dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
 Thats what she said.
 Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. Im gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
 Yeah.
 Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So were talking constantly all the way.
 Ill tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
 Maybe Ill see an accident one weekend?
 Years!
 Yeah.
 Heres my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
 My wish has come true, incidentally, because, youve met me, and you are happy.
 You know what? I think were a great couple. I think were a classic couple. I think were like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  Were like peanut butter and jelly, dont you think?
 Then dont do it. Please dont do this. Please dont do this.
 I dont know what Im gonna do!
 Please?
 Im not gonna be okay.
 No I wont! Im not strong! And Ill go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
 Oh thats mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
 You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, Ill just ride back with you.
 Ill be down in just a second.  Holly?
 So um... I think Im gonna go back with Darryl  Okay.  Goodbye.
 We didnt break up.
 Okay.
 Thats a really pretty song.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na!!
  Da  na na na na.
  Da  na na na na.
  Da  na na na na...
 Hey, sport.
 Ow! God!
 No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
 Yeah, so there you go.
 Oh, wow, so quickly.
 Nope. Nope. Not yet.
 Ill call her later.
 I dont want to do that.  All right.  She is going to freak out!
 Thats -- thanks.
 Mom, Im getting married.
 Why do you always do that? Whenever Im getting married, you dont believe me.
 No.
 Im not, Im not getting married. So...  Psych.
 And Im out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
 Ill take care of that for you.  Thanks.
 Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoors List. "Schindlers List" parody. ... Thats not appropriate, no.
 Alrighty, Dwighty, lets see how you did.
 No.
 Wow.
 Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
 A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Do I look like I am joking?
 If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
 Youre not.
 Jimbo, lets do this thang.
 Oh, come on.
 You too?
 Jim, they are a poopy.
 No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
 I agree.
 So lets see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
  Arrogance.
 And theres our smudgeness.
 Heres whats going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
 Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, youre going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Lets go.
  Ask him his name.
 Be respectful, Dwight.
 Its up to you to change his mind.
 Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
 Hes hard of -- hes an old man. Lets go.
 Stop it! Stop it!
 That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
 Here we go.
 Give me the phone.
 Give me the phone.
 Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
 Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
 Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
  See how its done?  Thank you very much, sir. I dont think youll regret it.  See what I did?
 Yes.
 ...  Its a million-dollar sale.
 Why dont you tell us?
 Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
 Whats going on?
  Kelly.
 You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Dont keep doing that. Ill give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
 Dont. Dont. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? Shes got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
 You were lying.
 Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
 I will call you when it is time.
 I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I cant tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I dont even know why I make it in such great quantities. Heres what were gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
 I think you should do that.
 Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
 I am jetting off on an international business trip.
 To Can-A-da.
 Canada.
 My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
 Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
 I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
 I have my passport.
  I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
 Well Ill just... Ill use different money for that.
 And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
  Well that is all in the past.
 They have one of those?
  Lets do this!
 Two are for souvenirs.
 I do. Its right here.
 No, I dont want to wear a bra.
 Stop it! Stop it!
 Okay.  Where is my translator?
 There he is.
 Yeah baby! Thats what Im talking about. That could be you  if you hadnt forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
 There we go. Our town car awaits.
 Its not just a van.
 Dwight, can you get those please?
  Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
 Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
 Take a sip of that.
 That good?
 Dont drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
 You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
 Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
 Yes...
 Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
  Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
 Shhhh! Keep it down.
 Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
  Hi.
 Um. Id like to see a menu please.
 Oh... okay.  Doesnt matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I cant see because I am in a--  GAH!
  This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
 Alright.
 Very cool.
 Okay.
 Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
 Wow!
 Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
 A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
 Guys, shes in there.
 Lets do this.
  Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
 Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
 Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
 ...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
 And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
 Shes foreign.  I am--
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you, Andy.
 Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think its better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that theres somebody out there that you love that youre not with.
 How about this one? Its Christmas eve---
 ---and everythings closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 1200 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
 Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
  Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
 Okay.
 Slept like a baby.
 Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings.
 Yes.
 Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
 No. Actually the trip sucked.
 The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
 I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
 And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
 It was not, it sucked.
 Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---
 That was a really good choice.
 No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
 That was a really sucky thing to do.
 Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think its because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  Thats respect.
 Oh brownies! Im taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
 Yeah why dont you send that to him in Costa Rica?
 Heh, okay, weirdo.
 She said she was going to give it to him right now.
 Yeah, they used to.
 Oh, can you imagine?
 Uhhgh.
 I dont know.  What?
 Hmmm, dare I?   You know what? Im going to, for old times sake.   Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.
 NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
  Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
 No.
 He looks worse.
 Uh, well Im afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
 Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
 Yes.
 I learned a while back that if I dont text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
 I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
 Thats true.  People say its icky.
 David, wait.
 Is there no way we can get rid of him?
 I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
 No.
 I dont.
  Dont do that.
 You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
 Youre welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
 So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
 Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
 Whyd you come back?  Why didnt you stay?
 I bet, for you.
  Shhh hot, why didnt you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
 Yeah, I am.  I am.
 I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like Im dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
 Okay, just summarize.
 Thats it, thats it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
 Mm.  Me too.  Okay, lets get this started.
 What are you doing?
 For what?
 No, no, no.
 Youre the bait for Toby?
 No, for one thing, hes not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
 Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
 Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
 Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. Im kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
 Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
 Good.  N-no no no, dont.
 Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
 Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
 Toby can I see those? Ooh.  Whats the matter?  Whats the matter? You scared?
 You mad? You mad at me?
 Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
 Huh?  He might do it...
 I dare you to.  Come on.
 Whats the matter... haaaww!
 Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, whos side are you on?
 No do it, do it.  I dare you.
 Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
 Son of a bitch.
  Just stop it.  You havent done anything helpful all day.
 Whats that?
 Frame him?
 Ive never framed a man before, have you?
 Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
 Hello.  Ive seen you guys around.  Im Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?   Uhghh, so I guess you know why Im here?  I need to purchase something.
 No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
 Grass, weed?
 I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
 Im not wearing a wire, so...
 How much? How many pounds is it?
 Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
 Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder whats going on.
 Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
 Yeah, lets just cancel this, okay?
 No, no no no... No, no.
 No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
 Oh God!
 No, no no no no.
 God! No, thats not... I dont know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
 Ahh, thats mine.
 Yes, its mine.
 Are you kidding me?  Thats my salad.
 You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
 Hmm.
 Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
 Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, thats who youre worried about?  Youre... youre worried about the cops time?  You think I framed you, and youre worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
 You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
 Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
 Do you want to hear a lie?
 I think youre great.  Youre my best friend.
 Mmm... okay.
 Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why dont you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
 Yes.
 Theres the x-ax...icks.
 Mmhmm, okay.
 Why dont you explain this to me like Im five.
 Ho-oh!
 Yeah.
 Ill be six.
 So the dollars a surplus. This is a surplus.
  Whoo.
 Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think Im getting you...
 Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?
 No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
 So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
 Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, lets just decide and agree upon one.
 Alright, so, teams forming.
 You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
 Yes.
 Why me?
 Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, Im going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
 Yes.
 I dont know. I havent decided yet.
 Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
 Yes.
 Ohh, God!
 Yeah!
 Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 All right! Cool!
 I have no idea.
  Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
 Yeah.
 Yeah?
 Oh, hey.
 I do.
 it was fun. We had a good time.
 Oh, thank you.
 Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
 You think thats good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
 Nine dollars. The boys department.
 Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
 Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
 Yes they were.
 They were.
 Mmhmm.
 Sits on a copier.
 Yeah.
 Very valid.
 All right.
 See ya.
  Hahaha!... well...
 Okay.
 Oh, thank you my dear.
 Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
 There he is! Hello, hello!
 Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
 Mm!  Yeah!
 Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
 Oh... ah, I almost choked.
 Hank, thank God youre here. The office is at a crossroads.
 Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
 Yes.
 Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
 Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, heres the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
 It is, yes.
 What?
 Okay.
 Oh, there we go.
 Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
 So, the copier.
 All right, yes.
 Well, what should I do?
 All right, get out. Get out.
 Hey David-  Im sorry. Im sorry. Im eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. Im stopping now.
 No, no, no, no, no. No. Im calling-  Im sorry.
 Mm. Im calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
 No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so Im not the bad guy.
 The what now?
 ...Like a tip?  $645?!
 I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
 All right, attention everyone.
 I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
 Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... its a good chair. I think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They dont have copiers. They dont even-  Gah! They dont even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
 Do I know what?
 Mm, no...
 $645.
 Right.
 Because that is how my mind works.
 Lets see...
 I dont need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
 This is so stupid.
 This is so, so stupid. And, God...  thats my phone.
 To be continued!
 No, I dont-this doesnt change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
  You think its easy?
 Okay, you know what? Why dont you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise Im taking the bonus. All right?
 It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put em in a room, and you just-  Hey.
 What?
 Good work. Im proud of you.  Mother-
  What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,  you should know that some people think its cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
 Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
 Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
 Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
 Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
 This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
  Alright... One more time around the block.
  Jim, Jim....
 That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
 Yeah.
 I know.
  Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadnt left India.
 Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
 No, no. I celebrate privately.
 Why dont we just do it now? Well do it quickly.
 Well do it quickly.
  What if we cant do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
 Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
 An intervention.  Its sort of hard to describe, but really its-- its a coming together... its a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.
 Okay, how do you feel?
 Uck... T.M.I.
  Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
 I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
 Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
 The ayes have it.
 Alright, well, lets look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
 Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
  Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
 Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
 I got it on a website, thats not important.
 Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  Im doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
 Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Heres what Id like to do.  Id like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  Ill begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  Thats how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Merediths drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we dont say anything shes not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.
  Thats-- you didnt-- you werent hurt by that.
 Okay, no, thats not what were going for.  Who has a problem with Merediths drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, dont you have anything?
 Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
 Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
 I want you to say Im an alcoholic.
 You can say it as loudly as you want, but were not going to believe you.
  Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and youre dead?
 Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
 Dwight--
 ...okay.
 Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  Its Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
 You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  Thats my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so Im not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
  Ill be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
 We did?
 Oh, shoot.  Oh well, well have to go someplace else then I guess.
 We could go there, sure.
 Yes, yes.
 I have a new place.
 It-- yep, recently.
 All right.
 Yeah, oh there you go.
 Thats good.
 Were party girls.
 Its okay. Its all right.
 Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
 Here we go. This is gonna be good.
 Yes you are.
 Shhh... just calm down.
  Come on. Shh...
 Heres the door. Heres the door.
  Lets start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
 I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
 So do I sign?
 As it turns out you cant just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.
  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
 No. No, no. There was wind.
 Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
 I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
 I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
 Go, Oscar. Thirty-ones my number.
 Beat it!
 Todays a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, Ill be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
 Wait, you still dont know...
 You still dont know.
  What are you doing?
 Andy.
  No, what Im saying is...
 No, thats not it.
  How can he still not know?
 I cant take it anymore.
 I am telling Andy.
 Who should it come from, then?
  Are you still having intercourse with her?
 Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
 Well?
 You know this cant go on.
 We have to put an end to this.
 Come on.
 When will she be ready?
 Is she crazy in bed?
 How so, specifically?
 Really?
 Its too late.
 I am already walking.
 Okay, what does that mean?
  Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
 Thanks.  Andy?
 Walk with me.
 Ohh, I do not have much time... cars all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldnt want to hear...
 Well... no, Im not. So I... Im not very articulate today, so Ill just leave it for another time. Another day.
 Which will be fine. I am off!
 Thank you!
  Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
  Dwight and Angela are having an affair. Theyve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
 All right. See you later.  Ahh.
 Yep.
 Right what?
 David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Dont ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where youve been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
 Sometimes Ill start a sentence, and I dont even know where its going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
 This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when its cooler.
  Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
 So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that Ive never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed."
  Oh, thank you.
 I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
 Okay.
 Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Heres an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!
 What you talking bout, Wallace?
 Hi, I am well, how are you?
 Oh, have you not?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Fax, why dont you just send it over on a dinosaur?
 Oh, well, then, email it to me.
 I will seduce her.
 No, I will seduce her.
 No, I got it.
 Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
 Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
 Michael Scarn.
 Okay.
  No.
 No, no, I never said Dennys. IHOP.
 Oh, dont start,
 You know what? I dont want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
 You will have pancakes and youll like it.
 So what?
 Maybe they are shrinking.
 They could be shrinking.
 Ah ha  Yup.
 Mm hmm .
 And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
 Argh, why are you all...
 Shut up.
 Ready to do this?
 Good. Here come the sharks.
 In nature, there is something called a food chain; its where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
 Hello.
 My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
 Thank you.
 We are a law firm.
 You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didnt feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
 Really? That many? This doesnt seem like a very big operation.
 Ah, so when did you set up shop?
 Oh Vietnam, I hear its lovely .
 So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
 Well that is... because... I am a genius.
 Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
 Try 80.
 Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
 Dont blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
 I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left
 Whats going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, thats not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
 Why is this little 2 so small? Its, its weird, you dont, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
 Excellent! Way to go! Nice!
 Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. Its going to be an incredibly hard decision.
 I... Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
 Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
 I cannot wait to contact your clients.
 Haha, we struck the mother load!
 Wallace is going to freak.
 Hes going to absolutely freak.
 Oh shoot.
 Oh God, what was that?
 Aw, its alright.
 Aw, my car.
 No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
 Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
 No, no, really not necessary.
 You know let me give you some money for this.
 Oh coffee, thats too much.
 Thank you.
 Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
 Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
 Ok. You know, our sales are fine. Were doing fine. Theyre doing fine.
 Why dont we just, live and let live?
 Live and let live.
 Its from James Bond.
 Im not going to make this call.
 My heart says...
 That is true.
 That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
 Jan... Ryan.
 Youre right.
 You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
 Just something I have to do first.
 Somewhere safe, where it cant hurt anyone
 Oh shoot!
 Those people will be ruined.
 Give it, give it. We cant do this to those people.
 Im not a shark.
  Mpfh.
 Thank you.
 Okay, bye bye.
 I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. Thats what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I dont even... whats the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
 Oh, hey what is this?
 Oh, she is hot.
 Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
 Stay  calm!
 Everyone, now  calm down!
 What does warm mean?
 Dont run.
 Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
 Okay, were trapped.  Everyone for himself.
  Help!! Help!!
 No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! Im gonna give him mouth to mouth.
 Hes going to swallow is tongue.
 Open your mouth.  Come on. Dont swallow it.
 Leave me al--
 Saving him!
 Electricity.
 Hed. Hedded
 Take hedded of.
 Heed. Heed.
 Take heed of.
 Take heed of.
 Okay.  This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
 Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
 I am not a mind reader, David.
 And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesnt like.
 Do you?
 You talking to me?
 What?
  No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A mans life is in my hands.
 Yeah.
 Thats not gonna happen. Im taking over as safety man.
 Yes.
 Im a smart guy.  Ill figure it out.
 No, I will.
 Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today."  Thats what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
 Shhh! Dont excite him. Dont make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley.
 Andy.
 No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
 Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
 Shut it.  Shut it.
 We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
 You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
 Come on.
 No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops?
 And youre okay with that?
 Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Lets do this.
 Come on Stanley.  Youre losing you.  Youre losing you. Do it!
 This is you were talking about.
 Okay, okay.  Ill show them. Here we go.  Stanley.  All right.
 No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
 Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
 How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You dont do anything.
 okay, thats uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
 I will divide and then count to it.
 Yes, yes I do.  I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
 Okay, I got it.
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive.
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
 He is an organ donor.
 Yeah.
 Hey, Stanley.
 Are you okay?
 Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
 Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
 Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
 Lets hear it.
  Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.  Ohmmm my God if youre wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
 My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. Its kinda nice...
  It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
 And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
 Too expensive.
 Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
 Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
 You have stress?
 During our relaxation exercise?
 No no, Ill help you. Ill help you up. Here we go.
 Let me getcha.
 Ok, alright.
 Ok.
 Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? Thats what HE said! Right guys, cause of gay?  Lets give this a shot.
 Hellloo...
 So... it wasnt Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that youre the killer... its uh... great twist. Great twist.
 I dont get it. Do I stress you out?
 Oh...
 Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. Its what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
 Ok everybody, Ive figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is whats causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
 What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh cmon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? Youve seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybodys laughing, and everybodys hugging each other...
 Si senor.
 Its not! Its not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Dont hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that Im so fit, or Im a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I dont want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
 I can already feel peoples stress starting to melt. I think theyre very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
 Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If youre here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
 Hey Hey, I dont go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
 Youre so lucky! Good one...
 Well...
 Pow pow pow...
  NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.
 I know where this is goin.
 No...
 No.
 Spite her - ok
 Oh, stop it Dwight.
 No no no no no no!
 Dwight youre supposed to do it this way.
 That is the way youre supposed to do it, idiot.
 Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
 Idiot.
 Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
 Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after theyre done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
 We are, we are a family.
 Oh very funny.
 Uhh... hehe hah! Im thinking Roy?
 I dont believe I have had the pleasure.
 Jefferson.
 Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isnt tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...
  Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
 You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems dont matter to him, because were just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  Im okay. No, Im not.
 I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
 Well I wrote them down so I wouldnt forget. Jim, youre 611 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, youre a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, youve slept with so many guys youre starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I cant decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, youre teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela wheres Angela?  Whoa there you are, I didnt see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...  Oscar, youre gay.
 Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And youre gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.  Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.
 They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.

  This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
 Could I stick it with a pin?
  Toby Flenderson to the principals office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and theyre wet with your urine.
 You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
 What?
 You find it?
 All right.
 Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
  Hello, good morning.
 You ready? And were off, like a herd of turtles.
 Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
 No! That is a toboggan, you never know when youre gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
 Yeah, oh dont say bucks, its not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
 Well that goes without saying.
 Hey! Look at what youre wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magicians assistant?  Thats...
  ...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
 No. Oh, all right.
 No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
 Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
 Well then... hey you know what then lets just talk.
 You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
 Is that why your wearing makeup today?
 Hello, Rolando, how are you?
 Rolando,  Id like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
 Okay, dont be nervous, just picture her naked.
 Thats what I do, steal my trick.
  Oh my God. Is that Jims?
 Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, youre huge! Thats incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... Im just, Im trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
 Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
  NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. Ill talk to you...  This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didnt! He is alive. And this isnt even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you cant return it. Or can you? No you cant.  Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
 I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
 Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
 I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
 I dont know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
 Got it. It works.
 But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
 Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think its worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
 Oh, I still have more.
 She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, lets go.
 I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."
 No, dont worry, the chain is off.
 Emails not scary. This is an opportunity. Dont, dont blow it.
 Its really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
 Oh, great.
 No, its really dorky. You were right the first time.
 Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. Its a really wonderful moment.
 I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
 Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
 Why?
 No.  Im just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
 Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
 She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didnt... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I havent talked to her since. I havent seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
  Ill just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
  Okay.
 I am on a lecture circuit. Im goin around to all the branches, and Im telling them my secret recipe for success.
 I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
  And I turn it on and I say Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.
 You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? Shes the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
 Do I look okay?
 Hi.
 Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
 Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
 Oh- Shes not here?
 A.J.
 She has a boyfriend.
 How could she do this to me, Pam?
 I cant do the presentation, I cant-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!
 I know, just... uh, please, Im going through something, okay?
 And then shell move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
||
||
 I can do this.
 Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Lets see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, youre a salesman. Whats, uh, whats your name?
 A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
 What do you race cars?
 Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. Youre funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
 Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so youre dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
 Huh-  Does she ever talk about me?
 Its all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention Michael Scott?
  Does it feel good?
  Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so lets just- Well just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay.
 Yeah, yeah... uh, I cant do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
 No, no, Im okay. Im all right.  Okay... okay.
||
 Want some pie?
 I went through Hollys things.
 I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
 I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
 I shouldnt have done it. It just- I couldnt help it.
 No, sh- she didnt. Im gonna read it.
 Yes.
 How?
 I know, I know. Youre right, youre right.
 No, that wouldnt-
 No, you dont have to do that.
 Okay.
 Well?
 She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
 Youre sure?
  Okay.
 I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
 Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
 Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
 Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
  Hello, may I help you?
 ...Jim.
 Ayyyy!
 Ayyyy!
  What was that?
 That was funny.  Lets go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
 Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
 Yeah, I hear ya.   Its been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think youre hurting...
 Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.    Theyre very pretty and I wouldnt want them to fall.
 Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentines Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
 Pam, really, theyre back?
 Can I have a word with you, Jim?
 Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
 Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, its creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
 --that none of us can be a part of--
  --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentines Day party.
 So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely hearts convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
 So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
 I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, thats a big needle, that --
 Okay.  Hello.
 Oh, OK.
 Yeah, me too.
 Oh, well, thats fine.
 Yeah, can I point something out to you?
 Youre actually talking a lot.
 Okay, here we go.
 Oh, God.
 Yup, Im good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.
 Type O-Ocean Spray.
 Yick.
 I looked at the bag.
 I looked straight at the bag.
 Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that dont have blood in them?
 That was mean.
 A hat.
 That is full of soup.
 What?
 Oh, already.
 Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I dont think I ate for three days.
  Oh my God, how long was I out?
 Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
 OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, thats hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if Im gonna return her glove.
 Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us.  Relationships, we dont need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
 Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, lets, who else?  Oscar.
 Come on, Im sure theres something you need to get off your chest.
 If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  Im sure whatever you did it wasnt your fault.  OK well, who else?
 Moron, if he was there wouldnt be a story.
 Really sad.
 Oh my God.
 Well then its a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
 Alright whos next?  Wheres Andy?
 What?
 You know what guys? I dont think we need to do this.
 No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentines, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  Theres a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
 No.  Not a giant net.
 I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
 Old fashioned meet market --
 -- I dont think it is.
 These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "Im in love I was hit by cupids sparrow."  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
 Hey.
 Ah, still early.
  So how you holding up?
 No.  No, I meant about being single today.
 Meh, exactly.  Eh.
 Oh, here we go.
 Hello.
 Babe alert!   Hello, Im Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
 Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
  So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.   Where you from?
 Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
 So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
 Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so thats sort of a repair.  Alright, Ill let you guys talk.
 Its going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause thats what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.  Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so  its not too late.
 No reason.
 Nobodys after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
 Its not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
 Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
 Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
 Hey, you dont deserve her.
 Hey, if anybody wants to go...
 Really?   Oh, thanks.
 You know what, you guys, you guys can get out Im gonna soldier on a little bit.
  OK.
 Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that Ive even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes its not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but its about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   Theres a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
 Pam?
 Pam? Knock, knock.
 I know you are. Knock, knock.
  4-9-1-7-4-5-1
 They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.
 Buddha.
  Buddha this bread for me, wont you?
 I, I need something to wipe my hand.
 That was helping. It was classic.
 No... God.
 Alright.
 Whos there?
 KGB -
 What the hell was that?
 What are you doing?
 You, you like that?
 Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. Thats it.
  Whos there?
 Dwight, get the door.
 Answer the door.
 Im not gonna answer it
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
 Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
 No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
 The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. Its probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
 Ive written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm.
 Too many words. Good ideas are simple. Golden ticket.
 No. Jim. Were a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
 No, you dont. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
 Woo hoo.
 Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
 ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
 Invite them on the tour.
 Really? Thats kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 I thought I did. So...
 Well no harm no foul.
 You didnt, but... itll be fine. Itll be good.
 Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
 Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
 Irrelevant.
 OK, Im going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
 My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybodys golden ticket idea.  That...
 Nobody panic. The good news is... they cant fire all of us, right?
 No, they cant.
 Oscar, you dont know what the hell you are talking about.
 Alright, then were screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
 Thank you, Jim is with me.
 Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
 OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
 OK, dont get that. Please?
 That is not constructive.
  Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
 How are you doing?
  My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
 Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just dont... I dont know.
 I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
 Youre breaking up.
 OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
 Yes.
 No.
  Yes.
  Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
 Woah, wow, who told you that?
  No, I dont think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
 Im not taking... Im not taking...
 Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
 Yes I do. Youve just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
 Why do you have a diary?
 OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
 Yes, you did.
 What are you writing?
 Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
 We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what youre thinking--
 Umm, nacho chips.
 Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
 Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean whats the point? Youre cooped up in there all day. You dont get to do your farming. Youre not dating Angela anymore. It doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesnt matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
  Its not ready yet.
 I have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called Shoe La La. And its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
 May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
 Yes they are, you just dont care about the information.
 He doesnt love it that much. Wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
 I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
 Right.
 Thats it. Thats it. You cant put a price on freedom.
 Thats why you made the decision. Thats why you made...
 You kind of have.
 Yes.
  Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- whats it gonna be, what are you gonna do?  Whats it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?  Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
 Yes it is, but it had to be done, didnt it?
 Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. Howd you come up with that idea?
 Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
 Give me the details of how that happened.
 What?
 David? David?
 David?
 Could I be a part of the meeting also?
 There is no movie called Willy Wonka. Its called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
 I cant... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
 OK, heres what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that its a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
 Oh how dare you.
 You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? Its a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
 Oh please.
 Toilet sponge. Its a hollowed out sponge...
 ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
 Theyre not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
 Thank You!
 Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
 When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And thats what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
 I want to see it.
 I want to see it.
 Give me...  Give me the diary.
  I like it.
  I think youre right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
  And classy, yeah.
   You know, thats good but its not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
  Yes.
  He is.
  Thats what makes him classy.
  Strawberries?
  Not classy at all.
  French. Classy.
   Yes?
  Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
  Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is.
  Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? Cmon, here we go, dont be shy, dont be shy, youre one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
  Yes.
  What? No, I didnt want to make everybody nervous.
  You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
  Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Lets go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
  Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from Os into Cs, for Charles.
  Took me all night.
  I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each others vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  Its gonna be mental! Its going to be mental.
  All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. Id like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
  Oh, nerd alert!
  This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didnt bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
  This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange
  There you go! Wheres the other?
  Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
  Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner.
  Oh! Well...
  Above and beyond.
  Thats true.
  No. Absolutely not.
  Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didnt want to worry people.
  Well, why dont-
  Charles is going to tell you.
  Well, its not official.
  Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
  Well-
  Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesnt it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
  Oh no, no, no. You dont have to do that. Ive got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
  I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that Im supposed to have. Thrilled.
   David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
  It was my understanding.
  Listen, why dont we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
  But the branch is still mine?
  Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
  Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?
  I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that youve never told anybody before.
  Come on. Whats your wifes name? Where did you work before you came here?
  Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
  Youre not from paper?
  Does David know this?
  Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
  And that- I-I dont need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, its all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
  Ok, alright, well Ill just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
  Whatever David wants.
   Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
  No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.
  Hi Stephanie, its Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the sons going to be returned, everythings fine.
  And I really really need to talk to David.
  I was never given a name.
  Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
  I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
  Nobody thanked me.
  For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think its a little hypercritical.
   Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
  Yep.
  Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
  Kevin? This is my branch. You dont ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
   Yes it is!
  No, it is not.
  Ok, so were on the same page, great.
  Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
  No, seriously.
  How old are you?
  Five years old?
  Im gonna walk away.
  Im kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, its just a joke. Its fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, lets continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
  What is that smaller stripper holding?
  Ok.
  Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
  Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jims? Go ahead.
  Its a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
  But its cool, and its-
   Whoa. Youre talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
  Yeah, why dont you do that?
  Yeah, here we go. Ok.
  What?
  Newsflash  Ive been here for fifteen years. Headline  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
  Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? Im going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  Im going to tell him everything. And Im sorry to say, youre screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And Im sorry. Im sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? Its not like steel. You dont put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? Youd ruin it.
  Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he?
   So is this the meeting youve been in all day?
  I drove.
  Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. Ive already bought em. And I dont have a place to store them. So, I feel like Ive been sort of boned.
  Do you talk to him about this? Youve talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
  Ok. Then I dont get it. It doesnt make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
  Clearly thats what you wanted.
  Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
  Ive put having a family on hold.
  And Ive never gone hang-gliding.  And Ive never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
  I dont understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesnt seem right to me. That doesnt seem fair. And I think that Ive earned more than that.
  Ok.
   I quit.
  You have no idea how high I can fly.
  I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Shouldve peed before I left.
  Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
  No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
  I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
  Why would I do that?
  You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
  Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
   What am I gonna do? Ill tell ya what Im gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. Im gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And Im going to stop worrying about calories.
  I have a job.
  Pam, what you dont understand is that at my level you just dont look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
  Any good headhunter knows I am available.
  Youre I need you to is my command.
  Hey.
  You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
  Oh! Hey. What is this about?
  Oh.
  Me too, me too. Is this wine?
  I already have wine.
  Hmm?
  For?
  Yes I am.
  Where you from?
  Thats a drive!
||
  Thank you.
  You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.
   What am I gong to do?  Uh... .
  PSST! PSST!
  Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
  Just close your eyes. Im going to start my own paper company.
  yeah!
  Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
  Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
  Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
  Close them.
  Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
  Obviously.
  Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
  Hey hey... whats up Chuck?
  No Im staying.
  Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
  You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
  This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
  Before you got here, Im the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  Im on it, dont worry.  So, how do I do that?
  Cant I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
  Thank you very much.
  Im starting my own paper company.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.  In all climates.  Its going to be worldwide.  And Im looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  Thats where you come in.
  Can you believe it? Well, well see, well see. Its just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
  Potential, lots of potential. yes.
  Its... its very courageous, very exciting. Um...
  Thats what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever Im gonna put my thing.
  So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
  I made it sterile.
  I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
  No, no no.
  Okay.
  Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You dont have to convince me.
   Stanley?
  Listen, Listen, Stanley. You dont have to answer me now.
  Just... I want you to think about it, Im starting my own company.
  Oh-okay, youre not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
   You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said Yes to that either.
  Hmm?
  Okay, I have immunity. Its my two-weeks...
  Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
   Well here we are... I would just like to...
   Alright then everybody, Im outta here!
  ... and I feel free!
  Shh shh shh... dont look down, look straight up. Come on please!
  Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
  I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
  No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
  So which way are you leaning?
  Thanks Jim.
  Okay, Okay, we dont have much time.  Just act normal.  Dont look at me people. Stop.  Dont look down. Dont look down. Hes going to see me.  Dont look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  Youre older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?   Alright.

 That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
 Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
 What shape?
 Alright.
 After breakfast.
 So how you feeling about the new company?
 You excited? About the new company?
 After breakfast.
 No, Im whipping them.
 Just let go.
 Let go, please. Just gimmee -
 I cant do this! This is pathetic, isnt it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
  I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
 Im not overwhelmed, Pam.
 Dont patronize me, Pam.
 Im not getting dressed. Im not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
 Its totally impossible!
 Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
 Okay, Ryan.
 Hes everything Im not and everything I am. Hes the whole package.
 Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman Ive ever met.
 He worked at that telemarketing place.
 Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
 Yeah.
 Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
 Yeah, I guess its not so bad. Got a few things cookin.  Umm...
 Alright.
 Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
 How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
 Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
 No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
 We can do this.
 Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If youll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
 Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  Its Michael.
 Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
 Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
 Im...
 Excuse me. Yes?
 Yes, it is.
 Yes.
 It is.
 Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
 Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
 Uh, nine.
  Look what hes doing.
 Hes stealing them. Okay, okay.
 Hes already paying for himself.
 Right here.
 Oh yeah.
 Sounds awesome.
 People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nanas investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then Im sure thats what she would have wanted. Does want.
 Well Im sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
 Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
 By wanting it more. By working hard-
 Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
 And I offer same day, free delivery.
 Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
 Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We dont - it doesnt have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
 Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We dont have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
 Whats that?
 Blech.
 Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And thats why God made so many.
 Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, lets get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
 I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. Thats what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
 So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... thats it. Thats our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people dont believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So Im gonna go inside. Im going to make some calls, Im gonna get us an office space, and Im going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
 You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. Theres gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
 I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. Thats what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Dont think a woman can be a man? Well, then thats your stereotype, not mine.
  Okay.
 Its right in the middle of the paper belt.
 Yeah, Im good. You good?
 You know what they say, keep your friends close.
 Yes, I am, Charles.
 Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. Were gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
 Its Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one.
 Hello! They took away my parking space but they cant take away my pride!
 I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
 We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
 We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
 I dont know I think weve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. Ive updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
 I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
 Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
 Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
 Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I dont make copies, Im the boss. Got it? I make originals.
 Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
 Would someone just make the copy?
 Just make that copy okay?
 Theyre getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks hes too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
 Im on the phone, please. Mom, Im gonna have to call you back. Ps being a giant B.
 They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
 Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
 Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
 Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
 No, youre supposed to say, "Rock the house."
 Thats my corner.
 No, this is where I work. I cant relax in the same corner where I work.
 Pam, I dont make the rules.
 Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
 Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
 What for?
 Yes.
 Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. Thatll show em.
 Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
 Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, youre the face of this company.
 Hey Pam.
 You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
 Yeah?
 Well, at least youre still being honest with me.
 These are shaped like paper.
 I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone.
 Dont tell them we have free delivery!
 They dont know that!
 Give him a guarantee.
 Just say the word.
 Yes!
 You did!
 Oh yeah!
 She did it!
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we dont have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really whats important.
 Hup!
 Hup!
 Hey.
  Is this good?
 Oh. Okay. Eds Tires, huh?
 I really appreciate it.
 Its for your trouble.
 No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
 Yes, I do.
 That was four years ago. Why dont you let it go?
 Eds Tires. Why dont you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
 That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
 Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
 Bring it in. Morning cheer.
  I need you to get me the prices that youre charging Eds tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
 Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
 Im not following you.
 Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think Im getting your drift.
 Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that youre writing?
 Can I use it?
  Dwight, are you talking about us?
 Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
 So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, dont you?
 Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
 Dwight?
 Is the cool new guy Charles?
 Is it Stanley?
 Hello, Dwight. Whats with the shirt? Are you alright?
 Oh my God! Run! Run! Its a setup. Setup!
 Dwight, run!
 You be cool.
 Just-whats going on?
 Mm-do... Dwight would not-
 I. Understand. Nothing.
  Wow.
 It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
 Its like, a girl says shell make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
 I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I dont know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I dont know. Is that clear enough for you?
 Hello, traitor.
 I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
 Im just getting hardcore with him.
 Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
  Is Mr. Schofield there?
  Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
 Wow. High score?
 Hello, Dwight, Ive been expecting your call. What do you want?
 So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
 No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? Theres no-
 Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
 Toward the sun.
 Noon.
 You have two seconds.
 Dwight.
 I hope youre not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
 So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
 If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
 I do too.
 Coopers.
 Damn it.
  Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
 Really? Thats weird. We didnt see any.
 What?
 Yeah, sure.
 Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. Hell be here in a sec.
  Yeah.
 Dwight, not now, weve been robbed.
 No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? Youre still stuck in traffic.  You?
 What about our truce?
 On purpose?
 Why?
 Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
 Oh.  Bastard!
 Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
 If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
 Oh, one more thing. Im going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
 Oh, uh oh, Im turning you down right now.
 You can hear me, but I cant hear you.
 Oh, great. Mr. Schofields ready to see me. Thank you so much.
 Walking in the door...
 Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And Im closing the door.
  Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
 Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
 What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
 Thats very rude.
 Im going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
 Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
 That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
 Good, good, good. I will see you.
 I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didnt bring it up?" Most colors mean "Dont say it."
 I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesnt feel as important though. Thats just how the world works, I guess.
  Its 430 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryans parents or Pams parents or my parents, you do.  Theyre gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
  Time to make the donuts.   Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I wont do it again.  Come on.   De-nied!
 Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!   Hey Pam.
 Milk and sugar.
 Thats what I said.
 Every morning.
 Were, uh, were doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, were having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
 You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
 Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
 Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
 Most do in the magazines.
 We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
 How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
 They are correct, sir.
 Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
 Lowest in town.
  Okay, sure. Right, so-- why dont you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
 Explain that.
 Well, we dont--
 Whatever, yeah.
 Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
 Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
 Just crunch em.  Just crunch em please.
 Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, Im going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but were just going to need a much, much bigger check.
 Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
 I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  Its this.
 I would love that.
 Was it nice?
 I love Pad Thai.
 No.  Theres a lot I havent done.
  Hmm?
 Were not hiring, Jim.
 Listen, I cant make you laugh right now.
 Jim, what you dont understand is that this companys worthl--
 No-- We dont have--
  Uh... Yes.
 Yes, well, were not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
 Thats a pun.
 Yep. Oh... wow.
 Of course not.
 Nope, nope, nope.
 Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that were broke.
 Oh, Im really worried that Im going to say it.
 Ah...
 Im good, Im good.
 It is.  Im good.
 Hello.
 Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe were expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables...
 And we are prepared to reject that offer.
 Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
 Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I dont even want to hear what your first offer was.
 Ill see your situation and Ill raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and youre going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I dont think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
  Well have to talk--
 Just amongst ourselves.
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 We are so rich.
 No.
 Its a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldnt you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
 Agreed?
 Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
 I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
 And I want Charles gone.
 I need him gone.
 Okay, then I want Pam back.
  Sales.
 Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in its heyday.
 And Ryan.
 You know, David.  I dont care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
 And dental this time.
 These are our demands.
 Our company is worth nothing.  Thats the difference between you and I.  Business isnt about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
 Thats one of em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
 Can we have the room please?
 Yes! Can you believe it?  Thats what Im talking about!
 There are certain defining moments in a persons life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I dont even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
 No, no. Youre done.
 Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now hes back.  Who could it be? Ill give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
  Its Michael Scott.   Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
 Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.   And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  Im going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
 If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
 Yes.
 Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
 When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
 Oscar, what were you going to say?
  All right.
 Not important.  Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
 Its going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
  No, you lost those clients.
 Okay.
  Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  Its a trash can.
  There you are, my friend.
 Pamela.
 Yep.
 I know.
 I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
 Michael Scott Paper Company only.
 Okay, well---
  I will--no, no.  Ill talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
 Against who?
 The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
 Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
 That was  us, right there.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, the Commish.
 Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
 Hey gang. Where you been?
  Whered you eat?
 Whatd you have, Stanley?
 So since you guys already ate, you wont be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?   Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
 Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
 Im going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
 Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
  Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
 Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
 Who quits?
 You guys gotta be kidding.
 I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, Im going to give you some seed money.   There you go.  Theres some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
 Yes I do.
  Its frontwards.
 No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  Im the bad guy.
 I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
  Whatever you guys did earlier.
 Just do it, okay?
  Get em there.  Get em there.
 Are you kidding me?
 Okay, okay, okay.
 So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
 If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
 They wouldnt make it unless people liked it.
 Okay.  If I give you your clients back there wont be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
 Fine, have your clients.  I can see thats what you wanted all along.   However, I rescind my apology.
 You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
 Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
   And Bingo was his name.  Lets go.
 I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
 Youre close with Pam too.
 Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, hes my number one choice.
 I like his hair.
 Okay.
 That sounds pretty biased.
  Okay. Pam, pros.
  I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesnt always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
 I dont need to tell you that.
  I dont think you are being totally impartial though, because you havent said one bad thing about Pam.
 Okay.  So be it, then youve lost credibility.  And Im going to go with my guy, and thats Ryan.
 Oh, wow!  Whoa!
 Ho-ho, man!  Wow.  Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  Cause Im not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
 I have a very difficult decision to make.  Its like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophies Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
  Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.   Well, theres no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
 I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just werent enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
 Im sorry, sorry.
   Yes, you did.
 Yep.
 No, you--no.
 No, youre the best person for the job.  Youre going to be great.
  Oh, oh!
 You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
 Oh, really?
 Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
 I dont know, I offered him his temp job back.  Well see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didnt get the job, so--
 I dont appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
 Oh! Whats our receptionists name?
  Could you send her in?
 Hello.
 Have a seat.
  This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.   Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
 He will be ushering you out.
 Oh, your face!  Oh!
 No, Im kidding.  No, youre not--youre not fired.  Yet.
 Oh...
 I dont know, actually.
  Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
 Guys, Im scared. Im really scared. I think Im growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
 Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
 Oh, really? Ok.
 What about the rest of you?
 At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I dont know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
 Who else? Who else? Ryan?
 Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
 What?
 Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
  I... was just learning... to... love.
 No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
 Thats good.
 If you ever want to come down here, doors always open, locks broken, so...
 Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
 Now you got it.
 Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
 You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
 Ok. I love it. I love it.
 I love it.
 Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. Theres no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
 Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Busters People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I dont know. Its like  Dave died or something.
  Daddys here and daddy is going to take care of you.
 I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
 Andys afwaid?
 Are you all afwaid?
 Daddys here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
 Funk is the problem and the solution.
 Ive taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
 Why dont you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
 No. Dwight is confusing you. That - its, its more of a disco.
 ... with coffee but without the haunted.
 Its a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
 Exactly.
 Wha - No. No. Not even close. I cant force you to go down but I can entice you. Im gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
 Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
 Holdin down the fort.
 Thank you.
 This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
 Kevin, stay.
 Kevin, stay.
 Stay, stay.
 Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Come on.
 Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly youre just some terrible monster.
 Phyllis?
 Hey!
  Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
 Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
 Oh, wow! What did you do?
 You didnt do that. Youre ok. Youre ok. Lets lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
 Ok. Thats ok. Thats not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
 No. No. No.
 Its her back. We just - We need - Lets - You know what?
 Were going to take care of you. Were gonna get you help. Lets - come on.
 Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
 I dont need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
 Its just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
  Alright. Here we go.
 You having fun?
 What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, were going to put you in here. Dwights going to take care of you.
 Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
 Oh, you know. Nohting. Shes  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But shes a tough, old bird. So...
 Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I dont think she would trade that memory for anything.
 You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
 I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
 I dont care. Bury it. I hope youre happy.
 I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
 Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
 Its better than I imagined it!
 Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
 Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
 Oh. Alright. There you go.
 No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
 I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. Were not going to eat you."  No.
 Hey, thank you, Creed. youre really getting this place.
 Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
 No... cleaning... up.
 Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? Its really happening.
 You guys are the best for coming. You dont have to stay if you dont want to. I understand.
 Really?
 Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. Its not even to "Y".
 Would you like to dance?
||
  Uh oh. Whats so funny?
 Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, lets all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
 See you later!
 Were just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
 Mmhmm. Yeah, thats right.
 All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
 A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
 Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
 Okay.
 You can go to hell.  Im kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
 I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and Im going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesnt make any sense. Were soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
 What is up with you two, Holly?
 Cool. For who?
 Wow... Im designing a chair. Its part of your pants. You sit down, youre supported.
 All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
 You bet your fat ass we are.
 Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
 Thats right.
 Newspapers for sale!
 I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
  What?
 Um, no, I just thought wed wing it. That cool?
 We could do a movie... sort of thing.
 Oh!
 Could we get a Delorean?
 Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
 Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
 No. No.
 Were circling it.
  Uh, its a sketch now.
 And now, presenting...
||
 Yes, I am.
 Ohh, Im thinking... Im going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
  Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
 Yeah, Im definitely getting in. Im a shoo-in.
 Im Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay.
 Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than Ive ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
 Yes!
 I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
 David Wallace told me!!
  I guess not.
 Well... I didnt know they didnt know.
 Thank you.
 Well, hes just thinking about his own gifts.
 Probably shouldnt have mentioned Buffalo.
 Shouldve had hindsight.
 I think it went well. I think it was good.
 No, it was a tough audience.
 Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
 Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next years sketch.
 Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
 Good to see you.  AJ.
 I didnt find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year shell be with somebody, and the next year, Ill be with somebody, and its gonna take a long time... And then its perfect. Im in no rush.
