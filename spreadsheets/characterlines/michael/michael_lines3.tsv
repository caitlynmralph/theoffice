  No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive?
 Thats what faggie means!
 It wasnt just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
 Exactly!
 Yeah, I know.
 OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
 I would have never called him that if I knew.  You dont... You dont call retarded people "retards".  Its bad taste.  You call your friends "retards" when theyre acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.
 Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
 No.  No its not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I dont know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  Im just... I, I cant even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
  Can you tell whos gay and whos not?
 What about Oscar?
 Well, he
  There could be others...  I need to know.  I dont want to offend anybody else.
 Yeah, Im sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
  Hey, what about Angela?   Shes hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
  I dont know, I can imagine her with another woman, cant you?
 Do some research.  Find out if theres a way to tell by just looking at them.
  Thats ridiculous.
   Lets call him and get the website.
 Well, theyre sold out.
 I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
 What?  What does that even...
  Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  Its not like gay... shame festival.
 I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
 I dont kn--
 Anythings possible.
  Well, Im not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
 The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
  Trick question!  Cause you cant always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
  Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, its all goooooood!  I dont particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.
  All right, everybody in the conference room!  I dont care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!
  Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
  Were all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays arent necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  Im doing this for you.
  Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
  Yes, thats a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
  Thats great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!   See?  Everybody has a chance!
  But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
  Right!   And I take that as a compliment.
  Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
  No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
 No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is
  Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
  You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, Im gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you cant catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
 ...and I just dont care who sees it, doesnt bother me!
 All right, um... sorry.
  Im sorry I called you faggie.  Youre not faggie.  Youre a a good guy.
  You know what, Im going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.    I did it.  See.  Im still here.  Were all still here.
    Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
  We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe its supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
  I am glad that today spurred social change.  Thats part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didnt, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...thats what she said.  Or he said.
  Oh, theres Gill.  Oscars roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
 Pam?
 Did you see Oprah yesterday?
 I, uh... I am going to be a father.
 Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
 I know.
 Well...
 Just do it, okay?
 Um... find out if theres a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
 Eight months?
 I dont even know if Ill want a baby in eight months.
 You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I havent had a baby, and you havent had a baby...
 Twenty years.
 Thirty.
 Its a deal.
 Yesh.
 Right there. Ah.
 Per diem.
 Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. Hes been stuck working under Josh, the poor mans Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
 Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
 Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
 Yeah, do it!
 Really? Okay. Well, word of advice unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
 Um. Okay, um.
 You got that?
 Write it down.
 Um.
 Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
 Good to see you. There he is! Theres the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
 I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. Its like the firemen. You dont leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
 Yeah! Wow, I didnt expect that. Its good to see you too!
 Hey!
 Ah.
 Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
 The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. Im still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
 Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
 I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
 That is crooked on that side.
 Hey hey!
 Yeah.
 Well, thats how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There aint no party like a Scranton party, cause a Scranton party dont stop.
 Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
 Wish I was. I love inside jokes. Id love to be a part of one someday.
 All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
 Ugh, that would be gross. Its not even lunch yet.
 SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
 Check it out. Hi, Im Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
 You know what? Im having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
 Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people youre gonna be there?
 So maybe. See ya.
 Because hes afraid to fly.
 Do you remember me from last year? Theres a party in my room, 308, cant miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
 Yep. Yeah, shes up front.
 I dont have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
  See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?
 I need you to do something for me.
 I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
 And?
 Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
 Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
 I will call him later with that message.
 Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
 Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
 Hey, Jan, Jan? Dont worry, I have got the tip.
 Youre welcome.
 No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
 I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
 The party Im having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
 Any messages for 308? All right.
 Hey hey, fellers.
 Whats up?
 Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
 Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
 Okay! Excellent. Oh...
 Shut it.  Hey, Pam, whats up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!
 Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
 You first.
 Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
 Well, lets...
 Come on!
 Come on!
 Fine.
 Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think its talking and being friends, and Jim thinks its moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, Im done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
 Okay, let me tell you what were looking for.
 Sorry, my meeting ran late.
 Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
 Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
 Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
 Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
 This is the party.
 Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.
 People have been filtering in and out.
 What?
 Sure. You like Cosmos?
 Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
 I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And thats just...
 Im not better than Josh.
 Oh my God. You dont even know. Shes single now.
 Im sorry, man. Im sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
 Yeah.
 I will. Ill talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how youre feeling.
 Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
 Evan, this is Jim.
 Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
 Best friends.
 Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, Im popular." But not me. Im very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, youll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it cant be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
 Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.
 Whoa. What are those stains?
 Oh, God, I hope its urine.
  Ahhhhhhhhh.  Im hungry.
 Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
 Lets gooooo! Lets go, lets go, lets go!
 Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
 Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
 Entourage!
 Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
 Dont whine.  Get the window.
 Previously on Varsity Blues...
  Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
 People work faster after...
 No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
 Ok.
 Ouchy.
 Three hours, wow.  Have fun.
 Hi.
 Oh.  Thats nice.
 ...what?
 ...you were at the dentist?
 Ok.
  What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  Shes my ex-lover!  ...ish.
 Hey Dwight.
 Do you want an M&M?
 No seriously.  You should have an M&M, theyre really good.
 Theyre good, huh?
 Hey.  I thought you werent supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after youve had a crown put in.
 Sounds like a good dentist.
 Whats his name?
 Your dentists name is Crentist.
 Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
 Let me see your teeth.  Let me see em.  Let me see em.
 You should... floss.
  Well then... I am glad youre ok.
 Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?   Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tigers head.  We dont have the technology.
 Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
  Wow, this is tough.
  Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!
 Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
  Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
 And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
 I know.  I told her I didnt know whether youd wanna do it... because youve always been so loyal to me.  Youve been my most trusted ally.
 Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
  Perfect, well, were settled.
 All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
 Ohh..
  Cant you?  Thats so nice.
 Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
 Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
 You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
 Because, Dwight... never lies.
 Because thats all it takes.
 Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
 Oh, Ill be fine.
 No, no, I dont, but---
 I... wont.   I wont.
 Well, I guess its time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
 Its a corporate lease Dwight, youve earned it.
 What?
 But you said you liked it.  Youve always admired it.
  Take it back.
 Thats my car.
 THATS MY CAR.
 I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
 Jan called me about your little meeting!
 I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
 Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
 Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
 Not.  Good.  Enough!
 I have a laundry machine!
 I dont know if I can trust you anymore.
 You can get up.  Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.
 Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And theyre done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesnt translate.
  Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and Im making him do my laundry for a year.
 Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
 Oh, its okay, Im going down.
 All right, Ill be right back.
   There you go.
 Youre welcome.
 Dont mind if I do.  See you in a minute.
 There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
 Theres coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
  All right.  Okay.
 I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.
  All right.
 Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
 Oh, wow.
 Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
 Yes, I am.  Its very sad.  Because he was my boss.
 Thats right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, Ill be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
 So did you hear the news?
 Yeah.
 Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  Its... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
||
 Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
 Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin.
 The older you get, the bigger the chance is youre gonna die.  You knew that.
 What?
 Oh my God.
 That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, Im sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
  So, Im not exactly sure how to say this...
 What are you doing?
 I didnt... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And thats when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
 I dont understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didnt even work here.
 You really dont get it, do you?  You dont understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
  A statue.
 Yeah.
 Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
 We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
 I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
 Life-size.
 Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
 Mm hm.
 Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
 But Ed truck cant because he is---
  DEAD.
 Thats perfect.
 Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
 What?
 Well, you know what?  I didnt wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I cant stop picturing it.  He leaves work, hes on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
 Well, you know what?  Theres something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you dont wanna talk about it, you dont wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
 There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad.  And thats   hard.  And its making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then Ill have done my job.
 I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and Im crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
 Okay, fine.  Hurry back.
  Okay, we can start.  Um...
 Yeah.  Pam, youre a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
 Okay, why dont you throw the ball to somebody else.
  Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
 Okay... Im going to toss the ball to Pam.
 Wow.  If you wanna cry, thats okay.
 Do you want to talk about it anymore?
 Wait a second.  Thats Weekend at Bernies.  Do you think that this is a game?
 All right, were starting over.
 You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
 Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk.
 How do you know?
 That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
 Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didnt.  Youre not a veterinarian.  You dont know ANYTHING!
  Oh, God!
 Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
 Oh shhhh--oot!
 No, hes not.
 No, hes not.
 Well, you cant get diseases from a bird!
 We dont know if its dead.
 Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
 Well, Im sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
 No, no, no!  Thats enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.
 Its okay.  Its okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. Its been a tough day, but its good to let it show.
 What are... What are you doing?
 No, God, no its not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
 Glad you could all make it.
 Dwight, do you have the box?
 You made this?  Wow.  Thats... thats very nice.
 Yes.
 Shhh.
 Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, thats baloney, because grief isnt wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
 Uhhh... nothing.
 Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
 Wow. Well. Ok. I dont care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
 I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
 Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
 Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
 Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So Im just going to have my soft pretzel, then Ill get to work, and Ill be super productive. Look out for me.
  Oh, shhh... Come on.
 Uh huh.
  Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
 No, I think youre cutting in line.
 No, Im not going to settle down.
 Get in the back please.
 Boooooo. Thank you. . Thats right.
 No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman Id like to see. You read my mind.
 I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. Youre an angel.
 Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
 Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. Ill be back.
 Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
 Thank God.
 Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
 All right! Thank you!
 Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. Whats going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Lets make a deal. So what is the deal?
 Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
 Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
 And I will be taking questions.
 Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, Im going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think were getting a lot done, dont you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
 Hey, what time is it?
 AM or PM?
 Oh, good.
 Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
 Yes. Right. Good.
 Goodnight!
 Nice dress, Ryan.
  OK.
 Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  its ada blah blah blah, its so super fun and its going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
 How come you didnt get me one?
 Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
 Its important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
 Wha? Really? You should! Its fun.
 I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... dont really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I dont want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
 Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, Im a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
 Kelly?
 Um... why dont you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
 All right, all right, all right, all right. This isnt Lord of the Rings.
 Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and thats true, but its also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense, Sig...
 Okay. Spoiler... alert.
 Just stop it.  Whats the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from?
 And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Whos seen that before?
 Thank you, Kevin.
 Well, I find it beautiful.
 No...
 No, Youre not going to collect them.
 No. This is delightful, charming culture.
 My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. Its just sex. People... everybody does it. Im doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
  What does that look like to you?
 No ones even going to notice.
 Hey, Kevin. Its a costume. Why dont you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
 Ill have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
 Oh, yuck.
 No. These smores are disgusting.
 Do you think they have any smores?
 All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
 Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
 Wow.
 Oh! Shes not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, were not married... yet!
 She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. Its still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
 Im going to be.  Hi, Im just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? Im sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know youre all thinking who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about? Well, Im not crazy. Maybe Im crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
 What do you say?
 I didnt hear you.
  Oh, youve got to be kidding me. Okay.
 No. I get it. I get it. Youre not ready. Well wait. This is a classic...
 Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like Ive known you many lifetimes. Maybe Im Hindu after all. Okay, Im not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
 Yes.
 Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why dont I come with you. Cause Ive got this book called the Kama Sutra.
 All right. Good night.
 Oh, God!  Oh. Wow.
 Thats so spicy.
 Oh. You waiting for a call?
 Wow. Pam. When Carol said No. tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
 I was in that marriage arena, though.
 Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
 Were so alike. So alike.
 What are you doing?
 Im... what? I didnt
  Can I have a ride home?
 These are not my shoes. This is just like that show Taxi Cab Confessions.
 Sorry.
 This is going out to Indians everywhere. Its a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, its time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But its not Christmas, its Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Dont invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If youre Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
 There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
 ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
 Yes.
 I dont understand.
 On whoms authority?
 What?
 Youre welcome.
 Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
 Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I dont really get it cause were not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
 Well...
 Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
 Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
 It is an outrage, thats all. Its... heyre making a huge, huge mistake. Lets see Josh replace these people. Lets see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they dont. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
 Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.
 Dont say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
 Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
 Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
 Nothing. Just checking in. I cant tell you, so...
 Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make?  Well be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
 What?
 Do I have any messages?
 Ok, ok...
  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
 You knew about this all along, didnt you?
 Traitor. You are a traitor.
 I dont know. Probably not. This is the worst.
 Darryl. Noble Darryl.
 I know, I know. Well, Ill land on my feet. Dont worry about me.
 So, youll be okay too. Youre a warrior. Youre smart, capable. Youll find something else and...
 Awesome.
 This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
 All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Lets go.
 Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
 Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him hes making a mistake... save the branch.
 No... way.
 No. Theres no one else.
 Okay, okay. Um...
 Why?
 You sent him cards? You never met him.
 Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and hes like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. Youre a bad person." Its very dramatic.  Although, I cant say I was a big fan of  Bowling for Columbine, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like Kingpin. And it wasnt. It was something else.
 I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
 All right.
 Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
 Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
 Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. Hes not going to say any of that.
 Because hed be intimidated and I, just... lets start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
 Dont touch me this time.
 Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
||
 The office.
 No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
 Anything?
 What if this doesnt work? What is the office actually goes under?
  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
 That was hilarious. The foam ...
 Oh, right. Okay, thats enough. Thats good.
 Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
 God, Dwight!
 What are we still doing here? Its over. Lets go home. Get the car.
 Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybodys jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
 What?!
 We did it? We did it.
 Right here! Right here!
 Yeah, baby!
 We did it!
 How did we do it?
 I dont understand.
 Here... Whos here?
 Yes, please.
 Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
 Okay.
 My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. Thats all Im going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.
 Whos next?
 Andy Bernard.
 Saint Bernard.
 What?
 Im not...
 Im not firing somebody on the first day.
 Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man whos way out of your league.
 Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
 Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
 You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as Im concerned,  this says Worlds Best Dad.
 Ah! There he is Tony... whats your last name?
 Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
 Well, theyre just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
 Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
 Welcome.
 Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
 Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
 Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
 A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
 Oh.
 They are nifty! Theyre nifty gifties.
 You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
  No way. Get him out of here. We dont want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
 Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
 Right.
  I present the orientation video.
 Not now.
 I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
 It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
 I dont care! Dwight! You all report to me! Thats all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
 Work it out amongst your selves!
 Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
 Will you?
 Please?
 Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why dont we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
 Yoko shack.
 Nope, no. Guests only.
 Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
 Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
 No, its not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
 Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
 Lets face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But its not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. Its funny. Its got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what were all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what were all about here in Scranton. So lets just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
 Sittin in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin.
 So check out how we live
 They call it Scranton.
 The Electric City. Scranton.
 The Electric City. Call poison control if youre bit by a spider.
  I am so scared... when people dont label their personal food.
 You like coal mines and you wanna see em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
 Well, so far, I think it is killin. I thought it would either be an A or an A+ but I completely forgot that theres an A++.
 Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
 All right.
 Okay.
 What is that? A squids eye or...
 How did you...
 People hate people that are different from them. Thats natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the Integration Celebration. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
 I know what a lot of you must be thinking. Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. Theres supposed to be music and its... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
 Ssshh stupid! Um...
 Thats it!
 Yes, yes! Okay!
 Okay, here we go.
 Oh!
 Oh! Oh! Oh!
 Scuse me! Scuse me!
 You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
 You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, whys my nose so itchy!
  Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
 Okay! Okay!
 All right, all right, Im on a roll.
 Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
 Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
 I understand. Were all friends.
 Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
 You know what? Ill help. I will...
 Dont be shy! Dwight! Lets do this!
 Come on. Were doing this thing! Lets get up.
 Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Im under this... Im under this hock here. I dont know what Im grabbing here.
 Weve almost got it. Push it! Push it!
 Im right in your crack!
 Up and over.
 Up and over.
 Youve got it.
 Youve got it, youve got it.
 Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
 Easy.
 Dont...
 What...
 I dont understand.
 Well, well squeeze you in.
 You cant quit! On the first day. Thats  heresy, my friend!  Okay, lets talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause hes... what?
 My management style? So... didnt you think Lazy Scranton was funny?
 Okay. Well, dont bother quitting because youre fired.
 You are fired! Im sorry, but we dont have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
 Dont try to apologize to me, man! Its too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
 Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
 Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
 No. We do have to get along. Cant we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
 The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
 Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
 Yeah! They punkd us! They punkd us good! Come on. Come on!
 Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
 Yeah.
 Go home, Toby. Just...
 Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. Its so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
 No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. Youre playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Dont, oh...
 THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
 See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although thatll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!
 Hi, Jan!
 I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
 Yes.
 But do you realize that that was actually Dwights idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
 What?
 Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
 So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
 Uh... that I have not decided yet.
 Thank you, Andy. Thats... very kind. Thanks.
 Shut it...
 Shut it! Thats...  suck up!
 Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
 Ohh. May I?
  Hey, look at me, Im a baby! Im one of those babies from "Look Whos Talking." What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! Whats a stapler!? I dont even know, Im a baby! Hey, Mom, Im thirsty! Im thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
 Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I dont know.
 I didnt hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... Im just kidding.
 Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
 Hannah?
 Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
 Because you think hes black.
 Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
 Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guys lake.
 In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
 Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
 Good. All right.
 Just... try to be cool.
 Okay, are you cool, really?
 Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
 Hey Martin, hows it going?
 Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesnt is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
 ...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
 Who?
 Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
 Yup.
 Apollo Creed.
 Close your eyes. Picture a convict. Whats he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... yo, thats shizzle. Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
 No. Thats not cool. You dont have to tell them.
  That is awesome.
 Well, we are running a business, so.
 Ah. Well. Thats not true.
 No you would not.
 This place is not prison. Its... way better than prison.
 Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So lets go!
 Why dont we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
 Its uh... two and a half. Im not going for bulk, Im going for tone.
 Yeah, its... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, youve got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
 Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
 Ah. A ten inch black and white?
 These people dont realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
 All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, theres somebody Id like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . Im prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
 Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, thats just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebodys bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Dont drop the soap! Dont drop the soap!
 Internet.
 And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what Im saying. Its not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
 I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... presidents son. And held him for ransom.
 And I nevah got caught, neither.
 Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
 The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And theyd come down, and theyd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
 No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobodys bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesnt sound so great, does it?
 Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.
 No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what its like to have freedom. And if this doesnt bother them, then I am out of ideas.
 They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
 Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
  Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why dont you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
 Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
 Im looking for the toy drive box.
 OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope itll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
 Umm... I dont know? Average kind?
 Well, that is probably from the test drive.
 No.
 Oh, thanks.
 Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didnt have to do that.
 OK. Did everybody get one of these?
 Terrific. Good.
 This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  Ive got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, were leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
 There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  Youre about five hours early to the party. Youre such a blonde.
 Hey, everybody. I dont know who you havent met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show em, show em the other side.
 Turn around, turn around. Come on.
 No, you get outta here.
 Yes.
 Thank you.
 Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
 That is my Christmas card. Its a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
 I know.
 Right.
 Yes, but what you didnt realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
 And next to your kids. What?
 I dont understand?
 OK
 No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, youre not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaicas largest fresh water pool.
 I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
 And its all inclusive.
 Yes.
 No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
 Id like everybodys attention. Christmas is canceled.
 Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Years.
 Jim, take New Years away from Stanley.
 Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just dont think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
 Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
 Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
 It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
 Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
 And not that you didnt want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what Im referring to?
 Take it from Toby.
 Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
 Its all...  OK.
 What are you doing?
 Carol?
 I dont have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
 This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
 All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
 Hooters?
 Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. Cmon, were going to Asian Hooters.
 Why not?
 Ok, feel better.
 Cmon Jim, lets go.
 Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly shes not yo ho no mo.
 Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. Theyre on a date. They look very happy.
 Carol used to drink lattes.
 She would get this little foam mustache...
 And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And shed say, thats not funny.
 She totally got me. She understood that we didnt have to laugh to enjoy ---
 Im already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I cant, OK, Im gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
 Im just gonna call her.
 Nothing hes doing is cheering me up.
 Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
 Youre right. Thats good.
 I dont know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
 Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak.
 Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.
 I dont think... I love it!
  I dont know what hes doing.
 You know what we should do?
 We should invite them to the Christmas party.
 Oh, you are such mench my friend.
 OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
 The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
 Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, its yours.
 Oh.  Thats what she said.
 Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
 Oh, party in the break room! Lets go, lets go! Thank God! Lets go to the break room.
 Shhh... Shut it! Cmon! Party.
 Were going to ...
 I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree?
 Do you agree about what?  Wow. Youre  lucky youre so darn cute.
 Whatre you talking about?
 When you know, you just know.
 Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
 Its... its one of those two.
 Yeah... well, its been hard, theyre wearing the exact same uniform. And Ive been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
 I honestly dont see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesnt love his wife just because hes not sure what she looks like?
 Hey. Wheres my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I dont know where she is. Cause Im drunk, I cant even find her.
 Haha, I do! I just havent hugged you in awhile
 Oh, good. That felt good. Lets go. Party.
 Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
 No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
 Where do you wanna go?
 I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
 You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
 That waitress was the one.
 How can you be sure?
 Dont make fun... Youre making fun of me.
 I guess, I didnt know her very well. I marked her arm.
 I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I dont... I know, I know. I cant believe I gave her my bike!
 Oh, why do I feel like crap?
 I had rebound? Yeah.
 I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didnt score and Im not sure whos actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesnt matter. Its all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. Theres this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you wont be disappointed. Umm, Its all-inclusive...
 Hey, mon!
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
 Just relax, OK? Ill get to all of it later.
 Arent you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
 It was
 Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
 OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
 Well, I am just getting settled in. So, Im gonna...
 You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
 Feelin hot, hot, hot!  Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Thats all I know so far, but Im gonna keep practicing.
 You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
 Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
 Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
 Inventorys at the end of December.
 I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
 Inventory is boring. In the islands, they dont make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
 Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
 The Jamaicans dont have a word for "impossible."
 How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. Thats all you need.
 Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
 No, no, no. No, thats a German woman named Urkel Grue.
 Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. Thats all Im gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
  Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
 Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
 Well Im looking at a photo, right now. And Im telling ya, could be in Maxim.
 Oh no?
 OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
 Check it again. Hit refresh.
 OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
 Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Wheres Darryl?
 OK, Hey, man, hows it going?
 Thats great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
 OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
 OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
 And you sent that out to everyone?
 I have a special assignment for you.
 A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
 Not important.
 OK, forget it.
 Not now, not ever.
 Aww, none of your business.
 That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
 This is probably the icebreaker you need.
 I bet you would love all the details, wouldnt you? Skeevy little perv.
 No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
 OK.
 Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her Im not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
 She bought it?  OK. OK.
 There an accident? Somebody hurt?
 Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
 All right.
 Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
 No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
 My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Lets be professional, all right?
 Feelin... feelin hot, hot, hot!
 Hey.
 Island living. You know?
 Did she say what its about?
 There are copies in the bathroom?
 All right.
 Guh.
 OK, yup.
 I...
 I... I... Yes.
 OK, yeah.
 Who is Dr. Perry? I...
 And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
 So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
 Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -
 Jan, you... complete... me.
  Jim, could you come in here please?
 Sorry, oh wow, thats so rude. Im sorry, I cant control him.
 You know what? Get Pam.
 Pam.
 Oh, that is gross.
 Damn it.
 Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
 Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
 Oh.
 Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
 Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
 Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
 You cant pass. Youve got to pick somebody.
 So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
 Dwight?
 Here ya go.
 Please.
 Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
 No, were just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
 Just bragging rights.
 Its just... brrrrrr... Its "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? Were in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Lets do it.
 Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
 Here we go.
 Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
 Hawkman.
  Lets go. The mens room was disgusting.
 Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
 You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
 You know what? Lets get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
 I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
 No.
 Stop it.  Stop it.
 Yes.
 Ah, no. Dont worry about it.
 What?
 I dont know. Who knows how words are formed.
 Yes, Andy.
 He didnt say.
 No, you are remembering it wrong.
 Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
 I knew it.
 Where were you this morning?
 Why do you lie, liar?
 You are lying right now.
 I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
 Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
 Dont. Dont you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
 Good luck.
 Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
 Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
 I said was.
 What does that even mean? That is impossible.
 But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybodys spirits.
 Hey, whats up.
 Yep.
 I dont know. Maybe.
 Bathroom.
 Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
 Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
 Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
 Yeah, do you?
 What did I say?
 Huh.
 Oh, no.
 No, hey, hey. Dont be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
 No, no, no. I mean, not because youre gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscars Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
 Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, lets get him one.
 Whos that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
 Hey guys. Hows the workload on all of Dwights old accounts? Handling it okay?
 Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
 Really?
 Dont - dont do that. Thats not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
 Nice to have Oscar back.
 Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
 Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
 Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
 Um.
 No. I dont want to do any of that.
 No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. Youre going to drive me crazy.
 Hey.
 Whats up?
 Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
 Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
 Hows this place treating you?
 Oh, well.
 No. Im sure.
 So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
 We can talk about that.  All right.
 Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
 Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. Youre gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
 Guilty.
 Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
 So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
 Wow. Thank you. Wow, thats-- thanks so much.
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?
 It takes a big man to admit his mistake and thats what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I dont want somebody sucking up to me because they think Im going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
 Hello son.  If youre watching this, that means Im already dead.  Life is a road---
 How, would you stop interrupting please?
 Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
 Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother wont be able to.
 To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
 Number eight, learn how to take off a womans bra.
 We will demonstrate on Pam.
 Come on.
  You just twist your hand until something breaks.
 Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
 And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
 Hes not going to be a murderer.
 You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
 Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
 Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis wedding.   So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you dont already have one.  This may be Phyllis only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.
 Im sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
 Im trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which wont be hard, because its going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, thats for sure.  Itll probably be on a boat.
 Whats up spinsters?
 No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 230 to 315.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guys night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, its more of a guys afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- its uh, not gay, its just a, its a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
 Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh!
 Oh God-
 No, no, no!
 I cant believe youre not going to be there.  Its going to be good, its going to be a great bachelor party man.
 You should get out of them.
 Its the only time he can do it.  230 to 315.  Its going to be great.  Were going to be doing some darts, were going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
 I did not order a stripper.
 Um, not personally, no.
 I cant get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
 So thats what that means.
 Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!
 Gay.
 Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
 Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
 Well get on it.  And make it happen.
||
  Gotcha, oh!  Yes?
 Im in the, Im in the sex shop.
 Squarepants?
 And you think thatd be sexy?
 Oh.
 Oh.  Hello!
 You wearing a thong?
 Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Whos a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
 Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
 Hes in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
 Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
 And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
 Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one.
 Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
 No.  Yes.
 But I got all the foot off of it.
 Guys, beef!  Its whats for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
 Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
 I call shuffle.  Here we go.
 Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody Id like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
 Nice outfit.
 Hes right there.  There he is.
 Okay.  Alright, Ill do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
 Alright.
 Okay.
 Here we go.  Alright!
 Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
 You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
 Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and Im sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!
 On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand Im afraid shes going to dump me.
 Really.
 Well, Ben Franklin, youre really kind of a sleezebag.
 Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
 Wow.  Thank you.
 Not really, look I dont know how to say this so I just will.
 I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
 No, today at work.
 Yes. I kind of arranged it.
 So you dont want to end our relationship?
 That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
 You are.  You are.
 So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth cant.
 Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
 Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her fathers wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like Im paying for the wedding. Which Im happy to do. Its a big day for Phyllis. But its an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
 There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
 How you doin? You excited.
 Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
 Youre probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? Its okay, if you did. Its a very natural reaction. Its your wedding. And youre nervous...
 Okay... umm... Im sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
 Here, let me...
 Just cover up that bald patch.
 Okay.
 You might be surprised to learn that Ive only been to one other wedding. Its actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
  I hate you!
 Long story short Jeffs dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said boo.
 This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies man, arent you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I cant believe Im actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Lets do it.
  Thats ok.
 This is bull****!
 Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
 I cant believe I pushed that... that guys lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. Thats... well... I got news for you, Albert. If thats your real name. The shows not over.
 Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
 Oh, shiii...
 Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! Thats what Im talking about!
 Congratulations, Bob. Youre a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
 Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
 Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
 Im already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
 I will take care of that.
 I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
 Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, Im Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, Im going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Websters Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who dont know me, Im Michael Scott, Phyllis boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige...
 The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
 Phyllis and Bob their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and shes kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was Easy Rider. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
 is a guy that...
 he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didnt say anything when Phyllis dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
 No. Im not going to...
 Ok. All right.
 Oh. Yeah. Youre out of here! Youre... Yeah. I hate you!
 Come... Come on!
 Dwight, just...
 Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. Im not even going to dance one song.
 OK.
  ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
 I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
 We are great together. We are a great team.
 Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I dont want this to ruin her honeymoon.
 Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
 Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. Im sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
 Yeah. Yeah. Hes kind of a weirdo.
 Youre... Youre welcome.
 They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say thats crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
 Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
 Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
 Huh?
 Pop quiz.
 Why is today a special day?
 Todays a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
 In business school, Kevin. Business school.
 A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
 Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing Ive ever said to you?
 Will they throw their hats, you think?
 A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
 Yeah, I know, I know. Im just saying if they did throw their hats Ive got a great line for that "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
 I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes youre such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
 We have fun.
 Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
 Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
 I cant hear what hes saying, but he looks like hes really into it.
 Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someones textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think youre inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
 So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?
 Okay, Im seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
 ...And products!
 Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
 We cant overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
 ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee youll come back.
 ...We dont want them back, cause theyre... stupid.
 Nice try, hows your Pollack-says-what index?
 Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
 ...Wait, Ryan said that?
 Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
 David will always beat Goliath.
 Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what were learning in business school?
 Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Cant you understand that? No, you cant. Youre too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks hes a tease. Well you know what? He doesnt know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!
 Business is always personal. Its the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
 You heard me, pack your things.
 Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
 A good manager doesnt fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
 Pam-casso! Sorry Im late, I had to race across town.
 Wow! You did these... freehand?
 My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
 I dont see a... price.
 Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, theres my... window, and theres my car! That your car?
 That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
 What?
 ...Chunky. Do you want half?
 Okay.
 It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
 Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
 And now, the chains.
 A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And thats why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. Its um, its really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
 MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I dont see how he can.
 No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
 I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
 No. Alright, this is getting hot. So lets just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
 AHHHH!
 Yes.
 I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magicians code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
 Alright.
 Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
 Pam, would you smell my breath?
 "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my bosss bosss boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So its kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
 Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
 Sure? Might be a good idea.
 Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
 Play some games?
 I spy?
 Oh, sure. Really didnt give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you.
 Hey, Buttercup.
 I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
 Thats what she said.
 Uh, yes you are.
 No problem.
 Ok.
 Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
 Ummm... I dont know.
 Maybe.
 Ok.
 Alright. Bye.
 Beauty. Thank you sir!
 Thank you.
 Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
 I dont care. Oh, wow. Here. Dont put my jacket. Dont give me that.
 Yes.
 Ok.
 Hi.
 Actually, its polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
 Oh, um, potato salad.
 No, its not.
 Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
 Its been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
 What are you looking for? You bring dip?
 Awesome. Im going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
 Over our love.
 You dont have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
 Its a heart.
 I love this woman!
 Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. Its weird. So...
 Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
 Ok.
 It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
 Yeah, but youre great now, right? Were all great. Arent we great?
 I could go for an appeteaser.
 Bagel bites or something.
 Dwight, wow. Thats not appropriate.
 David, how much did this house cost?
 Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.
 Yeah. Do you have any ice?
 How about some Splenda?
 This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
 You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
 Oh yeah, they dont allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But its fun. Its an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
 Crazy.
 Ok. Excuse me. Whats going on? What is it?
 What are you doing?
 Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
 What has gotten into you?
 No, no, no.
 Come on, lets go back to the party.
 Dont take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
 No, no, no, means please dont. Please.
 Im not going to slam you up against the wall.
 Youre acting inappropriate. Jan.
 Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. Its funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. Its just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
 Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
 You didnt have any of the potato salad did you?
 Well, if thats the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
 Im not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why dont you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
 I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
 Whatever.
 Thats all, you didnt mean it?
 I love you, Jan.
 No need for consternation, everything is under control.
 It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
 No...
 No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and hes just using this Roy thing as leverage.
 Yeppers.
 I dont... remember.
 Yeesh...
 Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
 Wikipedia.
 Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
 Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
 Hmm, well thats interesting Darryl.  I think...  that maybe you should...
 What Im saying is that,
 Ok, see what I did?
 By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
 Ok, lets try another one.  Um...
 Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
 Its a surprise.
 Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
||
 What?
 No, what did you say?
 Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
  Yeah.
 Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
 You know what?  Actually, lets go into the conference room.
 No, you know what?  Lets stay here.  No lets go... Yeah lets go to the conference room.
 Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws em off.
 Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
  I am declining to speak first.
 Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just dont think corporate is going to go for this right now.
 What?
 No, this is a power suit.
  I do not buy womans clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
 Ohh... kay.
 All right.
 Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a womans suit?
 No, I do, I, I wear mens suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
 There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I dont think that this is totally just a womans suit.  At the very least its bisexual.
 Uh,  MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... thats the mystery.
 Okay.
 Would you stop it, please?
 Its European, OK?  Its a European cut.
 No, they dont.  See?
 Italians dont wear pockets.
 No, I dont want to do that because Im twice your size anyway.
 Um, lets just do this in 15 minutes.
 Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the drivers seat.  And make one tiny mistake, youre dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore womans clothes.
 Lets get down to business.  Why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
||
  That was a very good point.
  You make a very compelling argument.
 I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
 Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
 Oh.  Come on.  Be serious.
 I... I cant give you that, I--- I dont make this much.
 I dont.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
 Plus perks, yes.
 Fourteen years.
 No, please, please...
 Ok, lets take 15, again.
 A bosss salary isnt just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Cant put a price tag on that.
 Oh, thank you.
 I didnt give you $40.
 Okay.  Okay, heres the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
 I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
 Well what am I supposed to do?
 Im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
  Thats true.
 You know what?  I should.
 I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
 You know what?  I deserve a bump.
 I am makin it happen, sergeant.
 No, Jan.  Ive never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
 Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  Ill leave right away.
 Yes, Im bringing Darryl.
 Mm-hm.
 Hey, Id rather kill myself.
  No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being Ive ever known.
  Fine.
 Toby, come on.  Lets go.
 Where?  Im gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, lets go.
 Yeah.  Fine.
  Dont ever touch a black mans radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
 Well...
 Mm, the Big Apple.
 Maybe Ill stay.
 Well...
  Oh, I...
 Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
 All right.
 Whos the boy toy?
 Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
 Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
 Pippity poppity.
 Six percent?  After all weve been through?
 I got you... jade earrings.
 No!
 No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex.   What are you writing, perv-ball?
 Why dont you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
 Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  Im not going anywhere.
 Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
 Well thats ridiculous Im not gonna make---
 Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Heres the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
 But you just said 15.
 Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  Its about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
 Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryls presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
  "Hey Darryl, hows it hangin?!"
 Bailer?  I hardly know her.
 Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
 Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
 Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  Thats like... a half an hour, every hour?
 Ok, you know what?  Youre making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
 Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.    Sorry, he is very lame.   Um, lets see.  "Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
 Ok guys, you know what?  I didnt--- I didnt interrupt when you were having your presentation.
 Yes.  Okay, lets do another one.  This is a good one.  "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
 Yes.  "Which can contribute to heart disease."  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
 Mmmm, no, no, its... sedentary...
 No.
 Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
 Okay.  ... What, Nerf isnt cool anymore?
 Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Mens Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  Id like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  "Hello, Im Michael.  Welcome to Mens Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example.
 Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
 Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
 I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
 Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You dont go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
 Indubitably.
 They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
 I dont know, I dont know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
 Nn--- Depression.
 Yes.
 You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?"  Well, I thought Id bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Heres the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, were going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, wheres Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, "Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?"  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."  But thats... not why Im doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin-da!
 Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
 Go buy some watermelons.
 Just...
 Lets do it!  Drop that sucker.
 BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
 Find out whose car that is.  If its Stanleys, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
 Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
 Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
 Yes, thank you for seeing that.
 I dont know if I wanna do this.
 No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, were not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
 Rock n roll!
 Thats right!  I am not thinking.
 Yes!  Yeah!
 Woo!
 Woo!
 I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point!
  My life!  Oh, my life...
 Everythings wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
 Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
 Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
 Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
 Okay... thats...
 Thats the whole point, dummy.
 Okay.
 Oooooh, my life!
 Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
 Dwight, you ignorant slut.
 And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
 What is it?
 Dwight, find out what the present is.
 Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
 You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
 What do I have to live for?
 Its complicated with Jan.  And I dont know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isnt nearly as good as it used to be.
 An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  Thats the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really cant say.  But, yes.
  It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, were going to recalling all of that paper.
 We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  Ive never been a fan.
 Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
 Crisis Management Squad.
 Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
 To save time, Jim.
 You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
 Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
 We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
||
 Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
 No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
 I want you to bring a partner.
 No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone whos actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
 No, no.  I need two men on this.  Thats what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
 No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
 Heres the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  Thats what happened to O.J.
 I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
||
 OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
 Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though shes a pretty unimportant client, really.
 And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
 So, let us consider this matter ended.
 I know, I know youre angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
 Well, we are extremely sorry.
 We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
 The watermark... its a one time thing.
 OK...
 What... can I do, for you?
 Well...  OK, well...  Um, wasnt really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
 The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
||
 No, Im a regional manager---
 No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
 Thats insane.  Well give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
 Doesnt matter.  Out please!
 Yeah, well Im calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?
 We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
 No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
 Youre right.  It will blow over.  But its not... going to take... a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?
  OK, I think thats good.
 "Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."
 Thats how devoted I am to this job.
 I know.
 I understand that, Dwight.
 Do you think youre taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now were wasting tape.  Im gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
 So Ill know where---
 Im asking Pam to do it, please.
 OK, ready?
 Five, four, three.  "There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldnt be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Lets not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasnt me.  Theyre trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day."
 Thats... they always give an ultimatum.
 Good, cut?
 Thought so too.
 Whats happening?
 Really? Is she OK?
 OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.
 Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
  Im sorry. Its pretty funny when you think about it.
 Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  Hes back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!
 What? Oh.
 Oh, Phyllis got flashed. Its, uh...
 Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but shes not even here, so no harm, no foul.
 Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe youre the flasher.
 Uh-huh. Prove it. Lets see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
 In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women cant have fun if they dont feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didnt hear me.
 Huh?
 I dont know. I feel... I drive a lot. Im spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
 Um, that... I dont know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
 I... uh, well, I dont know.
  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that cant happen. Not in my house.
 OK.
 This is the last
 Dwight, are those your pants? Thats a Polaroid.
 Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
 OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why dont you just take these women, put em in a burlap sack, and hit em with a stick? Because thats what youre doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
 See? Thats what were talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
 No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? Thats it. Conference room, five minutes. Womens appreciation.
 Oh, I dont know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
 That is not current.
 You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
 I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
 Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
 OK, no catfights. Please. Lets - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
 What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones arent really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesnt care. Society sucks. I dont even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
 Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
 No. Im being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
 Yes.
 Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
 I have to know whether youre serious or not.
 Ye - OK, yes.
 Youre right. Youre right, youre right. And you know why? Its because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where were gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
 OK, lets go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Lets go!
  I dont think shes gonna make it. Dont think shes gonna make it -
 Many women
 All right. Hope nobodys on a diet.
 Youre welcome. Youre welcome, youre welcome. OK. So, lets dish.
 Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
 What, um... what do you think of role-play?
 Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
 I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
 Jan says anything that doesnt scare us is not worth doing. I dont know. Maybe were different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
 No, its not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
 No, shes... shes fooling around. Its a woman thing.
 No... No, its all right. Im OK. Im OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?
 OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
 Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. Im unhappy when Im with her. Flat-chested.
 Shes totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
 Im unhappy when Im with her.
 Im happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
 Yeah, thats smart.
 That sounds good too. I dont know whos right. I just dont - I dont know. I dont know.
 I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
 Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
 Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.
 Lets face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. Theyre caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
 Mm. You dont want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
 Oh. Oh, no.   Its Jan. What do I do?
 OK, it stopped.
 Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
 Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Lets see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.
 Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
 Uh... you know what? Im going to... you take care of that. Im gonna do traffic... detail.
 OK, I am really going to do this.
 You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Lets do this. Lets do it.
 I love you guys.  Now Im getting her voicemail.
  Hey, Jan. Its me, Michael. Im just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so Ill talk to you later.
 Thank you.
 Abso-fruit-ly.
 No... No...
 Yeah.
 Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you. OK, buddy."
  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Theres a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
 Ughh... Blech.
 Just... all over. I dont want to do anything... Im dying...
 Right there.
 Maybe.
 Not it. I dont have eggs.
 Thats possible.
 Uh-huh?
 The CFO? Ohh...
 OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
 To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
 And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
 Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jans heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
 ...you just gots to get your freak on.
 Yeah.
 Hmmm.
 Really?
 Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
 May God guide you in your quest.
 OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
 Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
 Well, you cant swim in leather pants.  Im just yankin your chain.  Not literally.
 Oh, you know what? Uh, youre not going.
 Yeah, I know. Im sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
 I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then itll suck.
 Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
 We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about peoples character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
 What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. Its like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
 I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
 This way to the partay bus.
 Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
 If you dont like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
 Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
 Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasms turning people off.
 Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
 Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just dont...
 Well write it down before you forget it. Thats... Youve just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I cant stay mad at you.
 Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!
 Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. Americas eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
 Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
 Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
 Jim Halpert. Pros smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
 Im not playing.
 Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
 We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
 Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
 Then I will name your team the Red team.
 I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
 Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
 Andy Bernard. Pros Hes classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons I dont really trust him.
 It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
 Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
  Pam...youre missing things.
 Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
 Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so its not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest Im going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
 Like umm... ten minutes?
 Thanks a bunch.
 A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
 OK, whos hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
 No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
 Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Lets just... OK, its very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
 No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so itll slide down your gullet more easily.
 Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
 I cant say.
 The winner gets a regional managers salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
 The winner of today gets my job. Ok? Im interviewing for a job at corporate. And theyre only interviewing a handful of people and Im the most qualified and Ill probably get it. Alright?
 I didnt want to tell anyway. I didnt want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I dont know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
  Word.  There we go. Lets see it.
 Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
 13 hot dogs, everybody!
 Its very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
 Probably left them in the trunk of my car. Its alright.  Its alright. Here we go.
 Aaaaaand, go!
 Nice, Stanley!
 One. Two. Three.
 Excellent!
 I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... whos ahead in points?
 Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
 Please just check.
 What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
 Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
 Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
 No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
 Pointless.
 Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, youre up.
 Ji.. why not? Cmon.
 You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
 Whos next? Andy? Wheres Andy? Andy is never here today.
 Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
 Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
 Yes. Count to three, please.
 Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
 Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
 Okay.
 Dont, dont.
 Im not going to give it to you.
 Being the boss is also about image.  Ive never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I dont see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire."
 Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I dont want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
 God! Hes a comedian.
 Whos Amanda Bynes?
 Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
 You are being too modest.
 Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
 That is a very, very funny story.
 Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
 WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
  David!
 Are we all set?
 Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought Id drop in and say hello.
 Thought Id catch a show.
 Naaah. You know what? Since Im here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
 Um, how many people are you interviewing?
 Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
 Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
 Ah, great. No further questions.
 Okay.
 And Im really looking forward to working with you.
 I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. Ill be like three hours late.
  Yeah.
 Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
 Okay. Uh...
 Uh, okay.
 Stop crying.
 Ohhhhh...
 Why so you can do it?
 No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
 Moon each other.
 All right.
 Your loss.
 Cruise control.
 There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
 No. Not at all. I havent talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
 No, no, no. You know what? Its a done deal. I basically have the job already. Theres nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
 Yes, I...
 I have to buy another place.
 I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
 Who is D. Abramson?
 Why... are you here?
 Im good. How are you, Janet? Its good to see you.
 Why privately?
 Okay, sure, fine. Um, why dont you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
 Okay.
 Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
 Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
 No. Shes an alternate.
 So, how you been?
 Good.
 Yeah.
 Weird. Yeah, I didnt get both of your messages.
 Hmm.
 Sound good. Sounds fun.
 Hmm..
 Would you excuse me for a second?
 Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
 I dont know, thats why youre here, help me. Please...
 No, no. What do I do?
 What if she makes me?
 She made me do a lot of things I didnt wanna do.
 I wasnt.
 Youre right. Youre absolutely right. Im gonna go in there and tell her that we cant be together.
 Wow.
 Im in a very good place right now. Thank you.
  Okay.  Jan, we need to talk.
 Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
 Yeah.
 First got priorities.
 Lets get back together.
 No.  No, no, no, no.  Ill tell you this, it is
  Remarkable.
 Wait, wait. Check one more time.
 Very good
 Yes, indeed.
 So, I guess were getting back together.
 Your advice was good, but Jans was bigger.
 Heres the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didnt connect, I was miserable. Now, Im in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
 Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, Ill be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,   I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
  How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
 I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybodys names.  If you need to know somebodys name, just ask me.
||
 I am by far the most qualified person theyre interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  Theyre like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
  Hey!  Hunter!  Whas up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
 Jan in yet?
 Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
 Just say, "I want to squeeze them."  Its code.  Shell know what it means.
 Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
  Hello, hello!
 Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
 Why dont I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
 Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
 Thank you.
 Ive never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  Were GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"  I dont know, could be good.  Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper.  Its super duper."  I dont know, something like that.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 It is always a treat when
 Hey.
 Pretty good.
 Could have gone better I guess.
 Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
 Daaah, lets just run away together.  Lets just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  Wed have fun.
 I cant tell you.
 So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
 Good, Im glad were on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
 You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I dont think I could take... my girlfriends job.  Thats not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
 Good.  Very good.  Im glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
 Good.  Thats all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
  Ill be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
 No.  No, Pam.  Im baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
 Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  "Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in."  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
 Thats stupid.
 You shouldnt have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing Im baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.
 No, its for me, bimbo.  Kids.
 So Im back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
  Back to work.  Still waitin on that coffee.
