 I suppose summer had to end sometime. Its sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw Inception. Or at least I dreamt I did.
 Hes not the worst, okay? Hes not the worst. You know whos the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! Its not cappuccino.
 Its just coffee, guys! But, yeah, Ill look into it, okay?
 Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
 To get some ice cream for everybody. Its national ice cream afternoon. Great.
 And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
 Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of Ace Ventura II and that was 95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
 Dont bother Luke.
 That means dont. Havent you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
 No, it... Yes, okay, right.  All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.
 Come on. Okay, um...  Thats as clear as I can make it.
 Because I dont want it getting back to Sabre that were yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
 Nope, it wont be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
 Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
 No. No, Toby. Hes not. Yes he is. Hes my nephew.
 Luke is my nephew.
 Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
 Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldnt even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
 God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
 Thank you.
 No! No. Im just saying, why does God get to do something that I dont?
 Well, then, why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad? You just want me to fire Luke. Thats reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
 Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, its in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And Id point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I dont want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
 Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
 Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
 All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
 Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
 Im reconsidering sending them back anyway.
 Wait a minute.
 Dont-all right. Well, ok, youve just committed a felony.
 No, I know they fit. Its not about the fit.
 Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
 You dont have all the facts.
 I love him.
 No. No. Hes my nephew.
 Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
 I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
 Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and hell slow down, and Ill push him again. Thats the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. Its all about give and take, but mostly its about pushing each other.
 Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscars head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
 Give me the pointer.
 No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angelas boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
 Okay.
 All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So were starting with account setup-
 Okay, can I have that?
 Ok, I am going to count down from five.
 Im not kidding.
 Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
  You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
 Thats what youre going to do, Luke!
 I had to do that.
 All right. Are we good?  Youre okay. Hes okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
 Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
 Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldnt. These things seldom work out. I dont know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think theyd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hats off to them.
 Thats it? Really? Thats nothing. All right. Thats highway robbery.
 I can do that.
 Okay. Wait, what?
 Is there another option?
  This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
  Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. Its over. Its done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
  I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?"
  So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I dont think so. Were going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. Thats the key.
  One hour.
  One hour. Weve done one hour. Lets just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
  No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
  You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
  Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
  Toby, can I really tell you anything?
  Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think hes a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
  And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?
  Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. Were half way done.
  This is plenty complicated.
  Ive played it once or twice with Jeff.
  Jeff was my mothers boyfriend, who she married.
  Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
  Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasnt able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
  I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
  I guess thats why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
  Right. Why would a dog do that? Thats silly.
  When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But Ive never said it out loud, so...
  Well, lets not get too... This isnt a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
  You. Bitch. God! Youre very helpful arent you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
  You are good. But you know what? You cant help people. You couldnt help your marriage. You lose. I dont need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You cant help anybody. I dont need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
  Ok.
  Youll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.
  You forged them! You forged the forms!
  Yes.
  Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
  You dont make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing Im here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!"  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Lets do it to it!
  That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
 Really? They didnt call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
 Andy, what times the show?
 How long is it?
 Nope, cant make it.
 They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andys play, they took mine.
 I cant Andy, its too hard. Thats-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
 Wow.
 I wish I could, Andy, but I cant. I have plans that night. Im going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. Youre that friend. Im going to see your play.
 And scene.
 Oh, hey guys.
  I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
 Yes.
 Nope.
  This is ridiculous. Youd think theyd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
 No, Darryl. This guys a world-class actor. He doesnt daylight as your plumber.
 Are you kidding me?
 All right, Im sorry. God.
 Hello.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yes.
 Good.
 You enjoy the second act.
 Thank you. You, too.
 How is that funny?
  Boo! Boo!
 Mmm! Fruit is so much better when its dried. Ive already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
 Yeah, good job. Well done.
 Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasnt one of em.
 Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
 Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didnt think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
 That would never happen.
 Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
  I dont like that at all.
 Hey, whats going on here? Post-show blues?
 Yeah, I get those every day after work.
  Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
 I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
 I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
 Come on, Andy, seriously.
 In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  Im just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyones tightening their belts in this economy.  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasnt a victim, if you know what Im talkin about.
 No, that was- Im just getting into the first act.
 There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
  Look,  Its a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
 You mean cancer?
 It is?
 Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I dont have acne. I have a cold sore. I dont even have a cold. I dont know how I got it.
 How?
 What?
 Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
 No! It was like four years ago!
 Why at least? If youre guessing forty six just say forty six.
 How did this happen, how did I get this?
 You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  Its me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
 Dont even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
 Oh my God! What if I did?
 Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
 Theres no way Im gonna do that.
||
 Hi Donna. Its Michael.
 I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
 I cant even say it. H-I...
 ...R-P-E-E-S
 No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
 Does your stupid husband have it?
 Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
 No this is Holly.
 No this is Holly.
 Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
 Oh really? Was anyone killed?
 Any nuns?
  Were they in the missionary position?
  Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadnt been transferred?
 We would have twins.
 Mmhmm!
 Mhhmm! We would be married.
 Do what?
 I dont romanticize th-  No...
 He had no arms or legs, he couldnt hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
 We were more than we were.
 Ok, alright I gotta go.
 It didnt come up organically.
 Its nice to see you doing so well.
 Bringing home the bacon.
  Would you excuse us...
 He hasnt changed.
 Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
 What?
 Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
 Because we work together.
 Am I the princess?
  Ok, so Im the guy at the station.
 I have herpes.
 I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
 You know, I dont know if I trust Jans judgment. She...
 No, Im not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
 Yes, I dont...
 I know, I know.
 Got it.
 IM TRYING! GOD!
  Hi stranger! Long time!
 Im Michael. We dated for a while.
 Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
 Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
 Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
 Jerk.
 Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
 Carroll, how are you?
 Im great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, Im going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
 No.
 Weird...
 He sounds like a nice guy.
 Oh wow another living room!
 You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
 Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
 I have herpes.
 I just found out today. Its, uh, right there.
 Mmhmm, Im sorry.
 Im between specialists right now.
 Well I believe in love at first sight.
 I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
 Hi Holly its Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. Its just. You know?  Its weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? Youre wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I dont feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didnt joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I dont know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
 Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
 You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
 Herpes duplex.
 I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
 Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
 Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
 An electric car dealership.
 Oscar! Think abou- Think!
 Look at that.
 Nice!
 She is a beaut!
 Oh, look at that.   Smooth roll.
 Oh, god!
 Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
 I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
  Oh, my god!
 Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
 Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
 Oh, hey. No, Im not busy. Whats up?
 Its Jim, Okay? Yes.
 You need the big guns, yes?
 I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
  No, I dont have time for this. Are you kidding me?
 No! Okay.  All right.
 Oh, no, thats a male model.
 That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
 Nice to meet you.
 Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
 All right.
 Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
 Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, its showtime. Ready, one, two--
 Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
 Its showtime! Oh...never mind. Lets go.
 When I knock on your door, you know who it is; its Michael Scott. Weve been together forever and we-
 You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. Were going to deliver to you on weekends.
 And you know what else were gonna do? I cant believe Im gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so youd better shake my hand right now.
 Shake it, shake it!
 Okay. Thank you.
 Thanks, Steve.
 Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesnt even close the door?
 How do I feel about losing the sale? Its like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
 You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? Theyre a small company. Theyre smaller than we are. Whats our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
 Okay. You know what? You clearly dont care, so why dont you just leave?
 Why dont you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
 I dont know, your frame, your build-why dont you have a glass of apple juice and tell me youre not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
 Oh, my god!
 You know what this is? This is a stinger.
 Like the movie.
 Paul Newman, Robert Redford. Theyre bank robbers.
 Shhh! Hey! Thats my mug.
 Yes.
 Oh, no, no. No. Dont-
 Testify.
 Yeah, he is that good-looking.
 Okay.
 Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin at him.
 Oh...my god! Hes making her sell to him.
 Stay-
 Oh!
 Dont let us down.
 No, no, no....
 Im goin in!
 Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
 I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
 Dont! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
 I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
 A surveillance room next to this one.
 Yes. And its the sincerest form of flattery.
 Well-
 Okay. You know what, it wasnt just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
 No, we dont. Heres-heres my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
 You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
 So, you will?
 Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
 Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
 I know, I know.
 Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
 I can give you more money-theres your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-theres your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
 Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
 O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
 No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
 No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
 Yes.
 No, you may not.
 I said no.
 Were not-
 Okay. Lets-all right, all right. Lets talk. Please dont let him leave.  Dont leave. Dont let him.
 Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
 Okay. Well...get ready, cause its gonna get better.
 No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He cant now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, hes going to steal sales for us.
 He doesnt need to sit, hes a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
 Good-bye!
 This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we dont even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
  All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
 A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  Six seconds, MacGruber!  Pams got a lot of fun stuff planned!  Uh, two seconds MacGruber!  Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION!  MACGRUBERRRR!
 MACGRUBER!
 Oh, here we go!
  OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
 So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
 Blackula!
 Oh, so... I almost forgot. Youll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. Thats like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
 Yeah. Im sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
 Really? Were good?
 Okay.  Okay.
 Oh. Its a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
 Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what Id like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what theyre missing.
 Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
 Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
 You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
 Yeah, I bet it is! If youre gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
 This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbins. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
 I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I dont care if I take a bullet. Were gonna call them, were gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
 And we are going to straighten this out.
 Mmhm!
 Im a little peeved at Darryl right now.
 No, he didnt go behind my back. He went over my head.
 What is taking someone from behind?
 It was a good idea, though.
  What the hell are they talking about?
 Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I dont- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? Thats inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
 Oh, youre sorry?
 What did you just thought?
 All right.
 Okay.
 Well, dont let it happen again.
 I-
 Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. Thats not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
 You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
 Okay, that might help. If you said "Im sorry" in front of everybody.
 In front of me.
 So thats it.
 Is it?
 Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, its cool, man, I work in the warehouse! Im cool! Im hip and Im jive! And I dont care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
 Still dont know who I am? Ill give you a hint. I go over other peoples heads.
 Whats a bad idea?
 NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine.  Im not Darryl. And thank God Im not Darryl.
 Hey, can I play? Why dont you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
 Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
 Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
 If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
 Thank you.
 If theyre good ideas, Im not gonna say no!
 That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
 Oh...
 Well...
 Stop it! Stop, stop. Were thinking. Were thinking about it.
 You dont have to point to the fact that were thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
 I am not budging on the hat issue.
 Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
 Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then well give her a call.
 Sorry I was a jerk.
 Friends fight. Friends fight.
 Thats true, thats true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
  Um... kay. Uh, alright.
 Top of the Sunday morning to you.
 Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.
 I invited everyone in the office because its not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
  Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you cant refuse. Scooch over.
 But Im the Godfather.
 Are you talking to me?
 Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
 Yeah.
  Im not the godfather.
  So who is the godfather?
 Okay. Old friend, like, youve known him since kindergarten?
 No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
 I dont even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And thats not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
 Good morning.
 Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. Its as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. Thats great, because, you know, the paper industrys not gonna last forever.
 Good morning.
 Good morning.
  How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
 I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
 Oh, after you.
 No, I insist. After me.
 Thank you. You too.
 You know what, guys, lets just enjoy lunch.
 Shh.
 No.
  Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
 Are you kidding me? Stop it.
 Shh.
  Look at that. Look at that. Thats fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Lets go help Africa. Lets go build an airport. Well start small. Well have a car wash. Well send some cheerleaders to regionals.
 Yeah, well, thats just a pick-up scene. Okay, we dont have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
 Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
 Well, its, its-
 No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? Whats so great about your lives that you think youre better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? Youre mean. Youre mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you dont stop worrying so much about what youre gonna put in your gullet, youre gonna die in about a month.
  Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. Were proud of you.  Bye. Okay.
  Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
  Ill take a shirt.
 If youll have me, yes.
 Really?  Thank you. All right.
 No, Im not. Im staying on the bus. Im already on the bus. Im going.
 It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
 You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
 Hey, right?
 Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
 Tell them that Im in a meeting.
 No, you may not.
 Thank you.
  See you in a few months.
 Mm. Thats not gonna happen.
 Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
 How long till we get to Mexico?
 Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
 Why arent they building it themselves?
 Do we know how? I dont know how. You know how?
 Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
 What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
 Oh, God, you know what? Im gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
 And Cinco de Mayo.
 No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums havent even started. Now were those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
 Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
 Do that. Do it.
  Okay, driver, driver, if youre not gonna stop this bus, then Im going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.
 Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
 Stop the bus, okay?
 I didnt sign up for this. You guys are young, thats great. You want to give back to society. Ive done that. I need to take.
 Blah-di-blah!
 We could go back and forth all day. Its not gonna solve anything.
 Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you dont. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
  Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. Well keep an eye on America for you.
 Why quick?
 Is anyone still at the church?
 What? Shut up.
 It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
  They have him surrounded. Its the SWAT. The SWATs arriving.
 Ok, thats our street! Thats our street! Hes going down our street!  Come on everybody!
  There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!
  Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught?  Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And Ill tell you what.  You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
 Walk with me.
  Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
 Dwight! Sign please. I dont have time for parties I dont have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
 Cancel it! Are you still here?
 MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? Im a very busy man. I dont have time for your TV show.
 Im joking.
 Im joking. Im kidding around! Im not actually angry.  Im not busy at all, Im not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, Im a total Gleek.
 You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
 Kevin!
 Yes, I am. Are you?
 What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
 Why did you just say he was the boss?
 Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
 Uh huh...
 Big...
 All right!
  Okay okay okay.
 Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So Ill get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it Im ready for bed!
||
 Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.
 Wheres Michael? Wheres Michael? We cant start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
 Actually I think its not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
 Well some of us are trying to have a...
  Well I will turn up the volume.
 Okay...  Heeeeres what were gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
 Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until Im dead. Okay?
  Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
 Yeah, well I wasnt very hard to find.
 Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
 So these are pizza dogs, they arent pigs in a blanket per se.
 Well...
 Hes the longest baby in this room.
 You know what Erin you do have to.
  Thats what she said.
  Okay... Alright.
 I just went out for a walk.
 What? Really? That stinks!
 What does that mean? Partys over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
 Are you kidding me?
 Now thats going on?
 Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I dont know if its gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, Im gonna give it shot.
 No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
 What is there to like? Hes just, hes a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
  If you break that girls heart, I will kill you. Its just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girls heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
 Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girls gonna turn my hair gray.
  My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
 Uh... try "password".
 Uh... it was like eight years ago?
 Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been...  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
 You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
 The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
 Morning.
  Im Facebook.
 I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still havent heard anything back.
 A what?
 Dot com!
 I think an investors ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
 I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because Ive never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
 Your kidding?!
 You and me.
 Dont you work here full-time?
 Mm-Hmm.
 That does sound fun to me.
 Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention...
 MONEY!
 Pervert.
 Thats good to know.
 Wuphf! All right, Ive warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
 Whoo!
 We already have a buyer.
 At least.
 Thats right!
 Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
 No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
 Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
 There you go.
 Do not talk like that, Stanley.
 Here we go.
 "Its Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
 "Hes up there."
 Look at that! He threw em on the ground!
 No, its not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
 I wont sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isnt that right?
 I--yes. Were not selling. I will not sell.
 Cant talk, saving the planet.
 We Dont? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
  Eight Years.
 No, I wont even consider it.
 Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
 I think you are wrong.
 You may be right. I may be crazy.
 Im just saying that I think I agree with your point.
 I thought it might make me feel better.
  But it just may be a lunatic...  No.
 Good, good, bro.
 Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
 Nine days, though. Thats, like...
 Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
 Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
 So you would think thats a good idea for me to do?
 Mm-Hmm.
 Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
 Tonight?
 Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
 Hello.
 I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
 Im not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And hes also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesnt, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
 Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybodys money.
 You cant have it.
 The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that youre dealt.  Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. Thats easy. Gimme a hard one. Thats what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pams a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So...  Thats Uh...
 Thank God.
  Mmhmm, China. China.
 It was great. China.
 Everything here was made in China, Pam.
 They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But were falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
 Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?
 I found that in the waiting room at the dentists office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, thats the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
 My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
 What?
 So much for keeping our secrets up high.
 I know what were going to do. Were going to put our best minds on it.
 Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
 Welcome to your future.
 How do we stop it? With a big idea. Thats what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
 Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
 Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
 I dont know.
 Alright.
 I dont know what the  that was.
 No hes not right. Were not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
 No, no. That is right now.
 In terms of land, not population.
 No, no youre wrong about this.
 I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
 So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what?  I dont care.
 Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
 Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
 Very comedically humorous Jim.
 Try Control P.
 Not if the printer isnt hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
 Hey.
 Mmm.
 Yeah.
 Sure.
 Coffee Jim.
 Yes.
 Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I dont have time. Okay, okay, Ill just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
 Im pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California."  What?
 Pass.
 Pass.
 Lifeline.
 I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
 Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
 Is it going to be worth it?
 I dont need to cheat.
 Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
 Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, thats just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
 China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
 How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
 Dont... I...
 Yeah, I figured that.
 Wait. You forgetting something?
 This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
 Here we are.
 My point is... that as long as people like you and me dont stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
 I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I dont think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you dont, thats fine. That my friend, is your victory. Yknow, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they dont tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
 Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
 People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. Were gonna do a fun one.
 Thats it! Thats a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. Were gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
 Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
 Dont answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where were all in the air at the same time. Yes?
 I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
 We didnt get it.
 Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!
 Hows everybody doing today?
 Hows the party coming along?
 Are we over budget?
 No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
 Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. Whats the problem?
 So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
 Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
 Whatcha got?
 Well, thats a relief. Santas gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
 My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because thats what I want. Thats what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
 Yeah!
 Pam? Pam?
 Hi.
 Uh, because youve been on the Lam? Because the boring police have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
 Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
 You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
 That was the worst joke ever.
 Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
 What? What?
 Hold on, Hollys coming back here?
 That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
 Hollys coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
 You know what, well postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
 Cancel. Were canceling it.
 No, we have to cancel the party.
 No, no, no, were gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
 I know.
 Its not. Theyre not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
 Well then everybodyll chip in, itll be fine.
 You know what, Ill pay for it. Ill pay for the party. It doesnt matter. This is way too important. People, Hollys coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
 Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more persons breath away.
 We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but theyve never been cool.  The name is Bond... Santa Bond. Ill have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody cant get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. Hes not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!
 Well, this years gonna be different. Were gonna have fun. Its not gonna be tacky. Its going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. Its not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. Its gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
 Okay. Sure.
 You never know about the press.
 Could he help us with some parking tickets?
 Well, then hes not a senator.
 Okay.
 Okay...  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
 Pam, no, no. Hollys coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks its a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
 Yes, thats me. Come on it.
  Theres nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, whats better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
 When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
 She doesnt need an internet presence, you just know.
 What the hell are you doing here? Youre supposed to be in the courthouse.
 And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
 There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for Gods sake?
 Hello.
  Well, I never thought Id see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
  Why, youre some sorta wise guy, huh?
 Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
  Doh!
 Hi. Hi. Oh...
 Oh no, not the huggy monster! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
 Thats adorable.
 Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
 Isnt it wonderful? We love it here. Dont you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.
 What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
 This is weird. I cant believe youre here. This feels like you never left. Doesnt it?
 Oh...
 Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy...
 Well, thats understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
 You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andys mom.
 Because without Andys mom, theres no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
 Youre kidding me. Ahh!
 What a douche bag!
 Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
 Mmhmm.
 Good for him.
 Really? Thats creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
 Oh, you do?
  Yeah, Randy Newmans the best.
 Me too.
 Hey.
 Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. Im Santa Claus. Welcome.
 Its a sophisticated take.
 Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
 Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
 I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you dont. And thats just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.
 What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
 All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
 I havent told you about her.
 Im a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think thats pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
 I do. She is.
 Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it aint Tara.
 What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting.
 Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isnt that nice? Thank you very much.
 It is Christmas.
 Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
 Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
  I dont. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
 All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didnt mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
 Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. Thats what Jim and Dwight thought.
 When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I cant do this." But then, with this other guy, you dont have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
 And we did this whole stupid party for you.
 Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
 Hey
 Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
 Good trip down?
 Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
 I am dead inside.
 Oh, hey, hey, no, dont run. Youre gonna slip.
 Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
  Yeah, well, at least he was married.
 No, its not. Its not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
 Really?
 No.
 Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I dont want you to fall.
 I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
 No, thats not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
  From the mall. That...
 Well, that...
 Hey.
 Oh.
 Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
 Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didnt he say that?
 I think I know where he is.
 Mmhmm.
 Video games.
 A DSi?
 A horse.
 You, are you sure you dont want a pony? You want a real horse?
 All right. You have to pick up after them.
 January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, lets switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, lets push through. Well do this.
 Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Years or they break up. Now, if shes engaged, Im gonna go crazy, and Im gonna start attacking people. If shes not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
  Michael, I know what youre thinking. Hollys engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but its not.
 Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
 Happy.
 Sad. To soak up my tears.
 Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
 Sad, something to break.
 For you, job well done.
 Both sad.
 I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Hollys favorite. I hope she doesnt call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I dont know. "Whats your name?" Michael.
 Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
 So... high five me. Were back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
 Theyre so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! Thats a good firm handshake. Youre hired! Yes, lets get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
 Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
 Oh my God! Thats it! Thats it!
 Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
 Im trying!
 Im trying!
 What?
 Im not listening to music!
 Go! Oh, thats nice.
 Me? Okay.
 Im good.
 Oh my God!
 Hello! Oh, somebodys got a new phone!
 That is neat.
  E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
  Why?
  Bummer.
  Reeses Pieces.
 I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
 Holly doesnt seem to be engaged, but shes talking to AJ like she is. I cant figure it out. Do you think shes already dating a different AJ?
 When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
 But you did still love him.
 Do you love him now?
 No. Shed just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
 You think shed talk to you?
 Thats true. Shes really nice. Shed talk to anybody. Why dont you bring Erin to balance you out?
 Or sooner.
 Thats not a joke.
 Is it?
 Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 1201, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
 What is wrong with you people? Cant you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothings stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
 Youre just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know whats going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
 Just do a cartwheel!
  Eat it.
 No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
 Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
 I dont care whether you hate it! You said youd do it!
 Eat it!
 All right, all right, shh!
 Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
 No! You cant have any candy!
  Holly Flax.
  Not Michael, E.T.
 Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
 Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
 And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
 It was insensitive and I am sorry.
 I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
 Youre right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
 Okay, oh! All right.
 Okay.
 No.
 Yup.
 You can toss them.
 My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless its from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
 Look at where youre going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where youre going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
 You ready to do this?
 You know what? Im going to stay here as long as it takes.
 Its about you. Its about you. Go!
 You did?
 Okay.
 Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
  Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
 English?
 Oh no no, Im not picking on you at all. Youre English, correct?
 Im working on an English character. Would you mind gi...  Its called Reginald Pooftah.
 Michael Scott.
||
 I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
 No, no, no. And people dont understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
 Thats good. Pleasure to meet you.
 Dunder Mifflin.
 No, not right now.
 All right. See you around.
 Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
   Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
 Nein! Im greek! My name is Mikanos.
 Okay.
 I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
 You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
 Okay.
 Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, its been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? Thats what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
  If-a you change-a you mind, why dont you talk to Mikanos?
 Ugh. Youre the fifth person to tell me that today.
 Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
  Practice Olympics.
  I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
  Hello.
 She will have a greekaccino.
 It...
  I cant believe-ee. Its a miracle. She can talk!
 No more brain damage!
  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. Im going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since its a secret, and Ill tell you.   All, you have to close right now.
 No, youre not. Youre getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
 Andy, whats the problem?
 You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Dont let them down. Dont let yourself down, Andy. Im gonna go back in. Im going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?
  No, no, no.
  Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
 What? Come on. Its time for grapes.  Real fun day.
 Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
 You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
 I dont understand. I really dont. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
 Sure we do.
 Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
 Yeah, I understand. I just dont agree.
 Yes I do.
 Yes I do.
 I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
 Lets go.
 Lets go!
 Just drive faster. I want to get back.
 Okay, fine. My feelings dont matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
 No Im not. Im not in a bad mood. Im not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Lets just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?
 I need to pee.
 Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
 What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? Im upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
 Well I hope I make it.
 I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isnt here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
 There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. Hes my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
 Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you dont have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
 You know what, I can dial 411, get Jims number.
 Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, thats enough. Ok.
  Hey you guys. Listen to me. Dont get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. Youre so colorful. I wish I could understand you. Thats a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. Youll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  Im being serious. Seriously.
 Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I dont have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
 Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
 With that I can buy... half the menu.
 All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you dont sell?
 Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why dont you just throw one away now into my mouth?
 Okay. Youve just lost my business.
 Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
 Okay. Ill be right back. . Okay. You know what? Im sorry. Im sorry. I dont have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I cant do that to you fine people.
 Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
 Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
 I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. Ill be back later with the money. Im just gonna leave right now.
 Well, I think I can get through the door.
 Hi.  How did you know I was up here?
 I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
 Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much.
 Really?
 Can I kiss you?
 Okay.
 Miss you. Okay. Ill be in my office if you need me.
 Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
 Dont go. I dont want you to go. Oh dont go. Dont go.
 Holly and I are dating. Its been a week, and I still cant believe it.  It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you cant work for it. It just comes to you.
  Are these numbers correct?
 Okay.
 Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? Cause youre grossing me out.
 Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.
 Oh, yeah.
||
  Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
 Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
 What, are you talking about me and Holly?
 Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
 I... Okay, yeah, thats pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
 Thank you.
 All right.
 Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
 You win. But heres what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
 Anything goes.
 Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, were gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
 Pro.
 What? Problem solved.
 No, no, its great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
 Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing its working.
 Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I dont... I dont sit on your lap because its comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
 Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then well stop.
 Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
 Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentines Day.
 I love you.
 I love you-love you.
 I am really disappointed in the offices policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
 Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
 Hello, Holly.
 Here, shake. No!
 No, we cant.
 No touching. Ah, Im trying not to touch you.
 Oh.
 Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we cant do that. We cant do this. Ohh.
 I dont know what your body feels like cause I cant touch it.
 Grab you here.
 I will grab you here anyway.
 Never.
 I did say I would, but I was wrong. I cant stop. You dont what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
 Yes, it was that. Its that one.
 Were not supposed to PDA.
 I havent thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
 Thats what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. Hows this gonna be any different?
 I was in love with you.
||
 Its like a time bomb...
 ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
 Sexual time bomb.
  Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
 No.  Saving the world has never been this hard.
 No, I cant talk to her. I cant even look at her without thinking about it ending.
 Do the monkey face.
 I love that. I love that face.
 No. The monkey!
 Dont do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
 Thats good.
 Thats good. Hes throwing it.
 I know.
 Holly. Hey.
 Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
 Actually, its Valentines Day. Shouldnt be doing this today. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 Youre gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I cant handle it. So lets just...lets...
 Who?
 Okay. Okay.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay!  Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
 Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentines Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
 I do.
 What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
 After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight.
 Erin... what are you doing?
 Thats... Thats. Well, dont put words in my mouth.
 Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
 Mhmm! Its got action, its got heart, its got some bosom.
 Its got a lot of me.
 Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level Midnight.
 Dwight does not play a robot.
 By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
 That was not scripted.
||
  Well thats a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
 Okay.  No, its not good enough. Its not good enough...
 Hey.
 Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says its great!
 Did you? What did you love about it?
 No, no. Holly, this isnt Oceans Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and dont care about how it turns out. Whatd you really think, honestly.
 Is it, is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
  It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you dont think its great than youre basically saying that you dont believe in my dream.
 I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I couldve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
 Because, if I dont have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
 I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
 Yeah, youre a real pain in the ass. And Im gonna go watch the movie with people who think its great! And Im sorry I called you a pain in the ass, Im angry, and I love you.
 I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although Ive only seen Antz, but Ill tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bugs Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bugs Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, dont listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
 Who likes Threat Level Midnight?  Okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
 We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
 No, no! Actually its really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. Thats why there were so many people there.
 Hey...
 No its not.  Its not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
||
 Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
 Oh yeah!  Yes he is!
 No, no Dwight. Hes just being stupid.
 Still not seeing the problem here.
 It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look whos here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
 Hi.
 Oh, Michael! Thisll be just us.
 Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, hes at his funniest when youve given him five shots.
 And it also helps if youve had five shots.
 Whoa!
 Is Packer here?
  Dont know, dont care.
  Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldnt be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
 You did! You got burned, because Packers back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although hes probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
 Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
 And I dont have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we cant just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
 So you wouldnt mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.
  Lets look at this.
 Dont be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
 No!
 Best day ever. Best day ever!
 Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
 Please.
 Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
 No. Not me, him.
 Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think hes funnier than you? Oh honey...
 Hes funnier than me.
 So Im less funny than not funny at all?
  Uhm...
 Thats insane!
 And you made Hank smile, that doesnt happen often. Youre very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
 I dont know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
 Yeah.
 I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
 Youve been on the road a long time. And youve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you cant be peeing all over the walls.
 No it isnt.
 Yeah, a little bit.
 I wont.
  Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
 Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
 Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldnt be apologizing to Packer. That doesnt make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
 Kevin, do you accept the apology?
 Okay, go back to the annex.
 That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesnt speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parents expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
 I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And were through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
 What are you doing?
 I cannot believe this, youre sending Packer to Florida? Why?
 Okay, so youre tricking him into flying to Florida?
 You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
 He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
 Yes, about that.
 Well... I dont know if thats a good idea.
 No, nothing like that at all.
 Sorry?
  Sounds great.
 That is.  Its gonna be awesome. I think youre really going to enjoy it down there.
 Nah, hes an ass.
  You ahh.
 No you ahh.
  You ahh.
 I uh... I actually dont know why I brought that because Its kind of priceless.
 Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
 500.
 Get lost.
 That is how you do it.
 You know its really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
 In case... in case of what?
 I dont have an in case. Do you have an in case?
 Get lost.
  Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughters boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. Im just kidding. Im kidding. Im actually calling because Im in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isnt a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
 Hi.
 Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think Im gonna run out of gas.
 Well, Im writing a message.
 Im asking Holly a question in fire.
 Maybe.
 Hey you know what? Ive got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
 Pam.
 I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
 No, this is romantic.
 Why?
 I did?
 Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
 Yes.
 I could not have agreed with you more.
 Yes. Thank you.
 No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you cant talk me out of it.
 I had a great idea until you ruined it.
 How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line  I lost my head when I fell in love with you.
 Its easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
 Heres the ring.
 Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
 Is she not going to like that?
 At a gas station?
 That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
 Oh yea you didnt say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
 I just... its terrifying.
 I know but Im still scared I dont know why.
 Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him Dude this was a prop in my movie.
 Ok its because we havent sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and theyre gonna pay anything.
 Oh ok. For how long?
 Is he alright?
 You ok?
 Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
 Ok.
 No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
 No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
 Hey, howd we do?
 Thats great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
 No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
 Shhhh. Lets go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
 So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
 This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Lets go in here.
 This is where we first kissed.
 And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
 Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didnt love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
 In-grown hair.
 Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
 We saved a lot of lives that day. Thats where you first met Michael Klump.
 And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldnt believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
 And over here..
  Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what Id do.
 Lets go in here.
 This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
 That guys got more than he can handle as it is.
 That marriage would be a sham.
 Easy no.
 That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
 Only one that I was kind of worried about.
  This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with..  Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
 Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. Were moving to Colorado.
 Yep.
 Holly has to go back to Colorado. Im going with her. Im leaving.
 Kahlua Sombrero, please.
 Actually, I am meeting somebody, but Im a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
 Oh, really?
 And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
 Do not tell my fiance Im drinking on a Wednesday.
 Im moving out to the burbs... actually, Im moving further than the burbs, Im moving to Colorado.
 Yep. Dont mess with Colorado.
 No, no. I dont want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
 You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
 Thats what Ive heard.
 Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
 Really? What happened?
 Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
 Man, he is late. Im gonna call him. Do you mind? Im sorry.
 No, Im here. Im right... Im at the bar.
 You are? What bar?
 I... do not see you.
 Im been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
 Whatre you wearing?
 Are we both at the right place?
 I hear your voice.
 I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
 Wow... that is insane!
  Here we go! Are you ready?
 Alright! Here we go!
 This is it. What do you think?
||
 Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So, without further ado, lets start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
 Come on out!
 I am well, sir, how are you?
 And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue its Deangelo the whole time!
 I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
 Oh yeah... I know... thats what I was just saying... thats what...
 This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
 Yes it was.
 Are you kidding? Id come anywhere to see a turtle? Whered you find him.
 You know me very well, Dwight.
 Now Im gonna have to go online and look at turtles or Ill be off all day.
 So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
 I sorta like the old way.
 I know, I know, Im sorry, but if its not a big deal we should just-
 Is that good?
 Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
 You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
  Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
 And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
 It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
 Well, we dont really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
 Thats-
 You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You cant say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
 Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you dont even really have to worry about.
 Dont shave my lips.
 You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, lets not go overboard with the re-decorating, and Im still here-
 I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
 Deangelos great. I love the guy. But Im not sure hes a great fit for the office. And also, Im not sure if I love the guy.
  Snack time! Its the witching hour! Its the sandwitching hour!
 PB and J, my moms recipe!
 I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
 What?
 Oscar, here you go.
 No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
 No, thats good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are.
 No, its not insane, Oscar. Im been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, youre gonna throw it all away? No.
 Well, who needs him. Guess its just you and me, Dwight.
 I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, youll be fine.
 Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
 No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
 Youll figure it out.
 It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
 Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
 Why do you always say that? Youre gonna love it.
  Alright lets go!  This way, this way!
 Surprise!
 You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
  Here we go! Have Pam come down.
  Congratulations!
 We got it.
 Yeah thats fine.
  Hey Toby! You suck!
  Go go go go go go!
  Ive never seen this place in the daylight.
 Here we go, alright got it? Set?  Hello?
 Yes you did. Thats right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
  Go.
  Good morning Erin.
 You have big plans for tonight?
 You are getting so funny!  Very good.
 The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didnt just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
 Anything can happen at the Dundies!  Theyre like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
 Black tie optional.
 A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
 Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybodys right. Theyre like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
 So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So Im going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo!
 Think of it as part of your training.
  Okay, well well work on it.
 You are doing it.
  Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
 Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
  Okay, okay. You know what, I didnt actually lose my keys...
 Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now its all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
  There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
 No! God!
 No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
 Jim, please no loopholes.
 This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
 Good. Good. Good!
 Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
  Too personal. I dont wanna hear about it.  Lets try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you cant-  Thats right, youre not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect.
 Say it with an accent!
  The Dundies!
 Im here.  In a good way! Ive been here the whole time.
  DeAngelo, what are you doing? Theres a live audience out there!
 No, Ryan would never do it. Its too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! Its sort of our perk!
 Listen to me, youre not doing this for me, youre not doing this for you, youre not even doing this for them!
  Youre doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kids menu, wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say Its showtime. Get out there.
 Say it.
 You can do it, just say it.
 Now hit me.  One, two, three.
 Alright, here we go.
 Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.
 There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
 Well done.
 Alright.
 Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
 Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldnt be here tonight...
 Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson!  Come on up here you sick bastard.
 You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?  Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonalds wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!
  There you go.
 It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.
  DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
 Okay, were done! Thats it.
 Were done. Were done!
  So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping itd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
 What?
 No, no. Youre being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
 So what youre saying is you kinda like it?  Ive fallen and I cant get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
 That got a big laugh.
  You were laughing right?
 Were really close.
 Thats true, we wouldnt get seats together.
  You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
 Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
 What is your problem?!
 Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
 He is in an all-out sprint.
  Here...  Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard!
 Oh, okay.
 Oh my God, somethings happening.
  Yeah, okay.  Well this is gonna hurt like a mother.
 No its not.
 Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
