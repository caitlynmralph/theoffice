 All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
 So youve come to the master for guidance? Is this what youre saying, grasshopper?
 All right. Well, let me show you how its done.
  Yes, Id like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. Youre a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, Im sorry. OK. Im sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So thats the way its done.
 Ive, uh, Ive been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
 If you think shes cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
 Any messages?
 Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? Theres a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
 Its called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
 People say I am the best boss. They go, "God weve never worked in a place like this before. Youre hilarious." "And you get the best out of us."  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
 Whassup!
 Whassup!
 Whass...up!
  What?
 OK. All right. See you later.
 Back to work.
 Corporate really doesnt really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because Im scared of her. Because Im not. But, um... Yeah.
 Um... Me no get an agenda.
 I didnt get any agenda.
 Really? I didnt...  Did we get a fax this morning?
 Why isnt it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So whats the problem, Pam? Why didnt I get it?
 Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brothers, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesnt work great with faxes.
 Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
 OK...
 No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
 All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
 OK. No problem.
 Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldnt wish that on Joshs men. I certainly wouldnt wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
  Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
 Oh, thats not appropriate.
 Uh, I dont know what you mean.
 Oh, my God! Oh! Thats... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
 No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.
 Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I dont see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
 Hey.
 Guilty! Guilty as charged!
 Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
 Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. Its a guy thing, Pam. Im sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  Im Hitler. Adolf Hitler.
 Relax. Everythings under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Thats important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
 Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, dont you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
 Im sorry?
  If youre unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
 I think Im a role model here. I think I garner peoples respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
 People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that its really beyond words. Its really incalculable.
 Now I know theres some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
 Assistant to the Regional Manager.
 Im about to tell everybody. Im just about to tell everybody.
 You dont know what it is.
 I dont need your permission.
 Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
 Not gonna happen.
 It wont be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
 No.
  Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, Im a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
 I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
 Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
 No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then theyre gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Joshs people, but Im the head of this family, and you aint gonna be messing with my chillin.
 Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
 Introduce yourself. Be polite.
 Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
 Thats his profit.
 OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
 What is that?
 No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
 Discipline. Kinky!  All right, heres the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
  And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwights personal effects into Jell-O.
  Nice. Thats the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
 Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
 Pudding. Pudding... Im trying to think of another dessert to do.
 So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that Ive created here is that Im a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punkd and all that kind of stuff?
 You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
 Just follow my lead. Dont pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I dont want to...
 Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
 Why? Well, theft and stealing.
 Post-it Notes.
 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  youve made a profit... margin. Youre gonna run us out of business, Pam.
 Yeah. I am.
 But the best thing about it is that were not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. Im sorry.
  You been Xd punk!  Surprise! Its a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
  I dont know about that.
 What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. Its the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didnt work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
 Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
 Gotcha. Good. Id go with the rows. Thats a good idea.
 Today is diversity day and someones going to come in and talk to us about diversity. Its something that Ive been pushing, that Ive been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think its very important that we have this. Im very, very excited.
 Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
 Did you have a good weekend going there?
 Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
  Right. See? I dont even know, first-name basis!
 Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, lets do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
 Its diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
 Come on people, lets get em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
 You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I dont look at you as another race.
 Exactly, were not...
 With tolerance.
 Ignorance.
 Lets celebrate.
 Celebrate good times. Come on! Lets celebrate diversity. Right?
 You know what? Heres what were going to do. Why dont we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
 Yes.
 OK.
 Hey, hey why dont you run it by me and Ill run it by him.
 OK. Why dont we just defer to Mr...
 Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
 How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because Im white and Chris is black?
 I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
 OK, I will play guy listening.
 OK.
 Kevin is a great guy. Hes a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
 OK. Im sorry. Im sorry. Hes ruin... Hes butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!
  They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
  What you want a cookie?
  I dont think I can sign this.
 Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
 Sure.
 Heres the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and its probably more advanced than youre used to. Thats probably throwing you off a little bit.
 OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
 OK.
 Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you dont.
  I wont.
 Yeah, yeah.
 "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."  Hes going to lose it when he reads that.
 "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I dont. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didnt see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, Im going to have you all in tears.
 All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. Its time. Lets do some good.
 Get out.
 No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, lets go. Lets do it. Come on. Lets have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as Ive always said. But dont take my word for it. Lets take a look at the tape.
  Hi. Im Michael Scott. Im in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but Im also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If youre a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
 OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
 Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but Im going to add on to it later on.
 Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
 Yeah, well, if you leave well only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, lets get down to business and why dont I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
 Two fifteenths.
 Well, you know what, its kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Lets get this popping. Come on. Whos going? Whos going? Lets go here. Oscar, right here. Youre on.
 Oh, yeah...
 Wow.
 Wow. That is... That is a great story. Thats the American Dream right there, right?
 Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
 Well, it has certain connotations.
 Like... I dont... I dont know.
 No. Now, remember that honesty...
 ...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!
 I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Dont look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isnt just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get er done.
 Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. Theres this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. Im not going to do it but its...
 Oh this is a good one.
 Push it.
 Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
 No, that was inadvertent. We didnt actually plan that.
 Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Lets do it. Lets get ugly. Lets get real.
 Youll notice I didnt have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the balls in their court.
 OK. All right. No. Its good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
  Kelly, how are you?
 Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my...
  All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what its like to be a minority.
 I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
 Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldnt it? If Id brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
 What?
 That doesnt really make sense. Because you dont call them collared people, thats offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, its after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
 Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
 Lets go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
 Lay them on me. What?
 Thats not what you said earlier.
 The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? Thats what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
 I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
 I think it was you who didnt look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
 Well, Id recommend it. Its very good.
 You gotta crack these things open.
 Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It wont be popular decision around the old orifice.
 Well, its a suicide mission, you know.
 There, there...
  When have you ever done that?
 Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
 Theres a decision that needs to be made, and Im having an unbelievably a busy day. So Im going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
 Yeah!
 Really?
 Ah, none. Youre picking a health care plan.
 You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
 Nope, you cannot use it.
 Temporary workspace. You can use it.
 If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and weve talked about that already.
  Pam, Michael Scott. Hows tricks?
 Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears Im busy, busy, busy. Cant step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybodys doing. Everybody cool out there?
 Pam! Whoa, whoa, Im sorry, Im sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. Im getting a call.
 I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just dont let anybody in my office under any conditions today. Im just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
 Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
 Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
 Ah, what? Which memo?
 Is it a good plan?
 Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
 No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why dont you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
 OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, theres some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
 Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesnt matter. The point is, theyre not unhappy anymore. Theyre out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. Hes cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...
 You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
 Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldnt find the knob.
 So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
  Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
 Its says here that its a 300ft drop.
 So its not a free fall?
 Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
 OK, so I dont know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
 Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. Its all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why dont you take two? Because you dont get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
 Why dont you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
 There you go.
 Uh, nope. Nope. This isnt the surprise. Its surprising, um... because you didnt expect it. But you will... youll know it when you see it.
  Oh, Christ.
 Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
 Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
 Oh come on! Thats horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, its after five. Oh, oh its awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
 Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
 All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
 When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
  God, yeah... Ah! This...
 Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  "Hi. Im Mork from Ork." Well, Im Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
 Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
 Theres no downsizing.
 Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
 Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing, okay?
 But theres no downsizing, so just dont...
 Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
 It looks like theres gonna be downsizing. And its part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "Youre fired."  "Youre foir-ed. Uh, youre foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office cant function that way. No way.  "Youre foir-ed."  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "Youre hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But thats unrealistic, so...
 Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
 Who is it? Whos the birthday?
 Next person on the...
 ...calendar.
 Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
 Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, itll be a surprise.
 Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
  Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
 These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing 80s party last year. Off the hook!
 So I was thinking, if you havent already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
 Shes not the only one thats going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. Its not, uh, its not just about her, so...
 Mint chocolate chip! Thatd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
  Can you get her? Shes right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Merediths card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, lets see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard youre turning 46, but, come on, youre an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I dont appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, heres the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. Ive already set the bar really high. And theyre all worried about their jobs, you know. Its kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. Youre great. Love, Michael."
  Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Dont bring that lamb to work or itll poop on the floor.
 Hey, Oscar! Come on in. Whats up?
 Oh, not at all. Come on in. Whats going on?
 What?
 Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
 No, Im always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
 Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. Thats what I say, so...
  Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
 Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
 Theres not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
 I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
  Which one is that again?
 Oh God! Dwight, no. Im trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
 You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. Ill work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
 Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Lets go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
 Its surprise Meredith. One, two...
 Find a key.
 And many more!
 You were surprised, werent you?
 You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hells goin on here?" Good cake. Why dont you have some?
 Come on. A little bit.
 Oh, right. God, too bad. Its so good.
 You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think Id kill myself. Cause this is way, way too good.
 Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
 Well, you know, money isnt everything Jim. Its not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe youll give more than three dollars next time.
 Is Oscar around?
 I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didnt think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
 I know...
 Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
 No, no, no, no, no. That wasnt what I wasnt, that wasnt... No. It-it-its not about the money. Its just... it... its the ethics of the thing, Oscar. Hows your nephew? Is he in good shape?
 How many miles did he do last year?
 Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
 Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
  I dont know about that.
  Huh! Thanks, downer.
 Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because youre gettin old.
  You didnt get the joke. So, thats cool. Thats, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didnt use. Um... Oh, wheres that? Oh, OK, heres a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." Cause Merediths been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
 Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
 Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
 "Shes so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
 That wasnt even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, dont get mad at me.
 This isnt my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
 OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think were losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasnt gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscars nephews... walkathon. $25.
 Per mile, yes.
 When I retire, I... dont want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
 A check for the kids, and for the team.
 I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I dont, I dont know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott."  "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because Im him."
 Come here.  Dont cash that till Friday, OK?
  Hey, you ready?
 All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent.
 Today at lunchtime were going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed theyd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun."  And so I started messing around and... Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, its really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
 Pam, Pam, thank you maam. Messages, please. Thank you.
 No. And thats not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
  When I let him come to my pick-up game...
  I vouched for you.
 I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, heres what Im going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
 Good. Excellent, itll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so were going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobodys gonna want to do it and I know everybodys gonna complain and bitch and I dont want to have to deal with that.
 Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
 No, its not. Its lower, so...
 All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But dont you call it that, Ive earned the right.
 And here we have "Mister Rogers Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. Hes temping upstairs.
 And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
 No, its Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
  And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
 You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her its part of the job!  Rapport!
 So, um, one oclock sharp and weve got a game on.
 Oh, I see, youre chickening out on me. Youre bailing on me.
 Oh, well, Im glad that some time is a busy time because whenever Im down here it doesnt seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you cant take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
 All right, see you at one.
 Are we ready for the game?
 I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
 Nerd. That is why youre not on the team.
 Uh,  "Ill help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
 OK, so, lets put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
 Um, what do you play? Center?
 Uh...
 Uh, I dont know. I dont remember saying that.
 Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
  Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
 Yes.
 Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
 I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
 No.
 No, no, ridiculous.
  Off the backboard!
 Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
 Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
 Oh, yeah right.
 Oh, yuck, thats worse than you playing. ... Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. Thats where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, youre on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
 Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
 Oh ho, oh, hes running. Hes running. Hes running, but he cant hide because you know what? One oclock, you better bring your A game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
 Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, Im gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
 What?
 OK. Cool, youre on.  Dont screw this up.
  Classic beginners mistake, eating before a game.
 Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, lets bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, youre fired. Thats a joke.  OK, lets do it.
 All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
 OK.
 OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
 Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
 Aw, come on Dwight.
 On. Just put it on.
 Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why dont you do the uh, jump ball OK?
 Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Whos on him? Somebody get him!
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Here we go. Three!  Lets go to the zone! Were going to zone!
 Whos got Roy?
  Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those.  Dwight, I was open. All right, lets go.
  OK, foul. Charging. Charging. Thats a foul.
 OK, Ill take it.  OK.
 When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. Its gone, Im in the zone.
  What is wrong with me today?!
 Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I dont know... I might just be a basketball machine. Whats Dunder Mifflin? Ive never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, thats probably gonna happen, actually.
 Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!
 That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
  Nice! Come here!
 Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
 You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
 Football is like rock and roll, its just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? Youre kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. Its all downbeat, its in the pocket, its like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
 All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
 Whats going on? Whats going on? Youre playing like a bunch of girls.
 All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
 Shoot, shoot it.   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
  Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
  Yes!
  Watch the long passes, you guys!
 Dwight!
  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, whats the score?
 Yeah, baby, here we go!
  Jim! Jim! Right here!  Ow! God! Hold it!
 Foul! Foul!
 Oh, that hurts.
 Whats your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
 No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
  Yes, it was. You know what, Im just being fair.
 Game over. Game over. That is it! Im sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, thats just... were having a friendly game. Its a shame. This is a damn shame, but were like a family here and that just, that wont fly.
 Thanks Dwight.
 Well, lets just say whoever was ahead won.
 It was us? Really? I didnt, I didnt know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
 Um... well, you guys, you know, Im the boss so...
 Hey, hey...
  You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that wouldve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. Im embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, were coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
 Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
 Come on. Lets not be gloomy here man. Were all in this together. Were a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobodys coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
 The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you dont win. But we did because we were ahead.
 Affirmative.
 You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
 Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
 Okay
 Uh, huh.
 Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. Thats cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
 Um, question Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman thatve been promoted to...
 I didnt mean me!
 Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
 Its illegal. Cant do that.  Next best thing.
 Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. Thats just stupid.
 Pam!
 Burger with cheese!
 And fries!
 And shake! What? Go ahead.
 No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
 Pam. Pam. Come on, Im busy. So just tell her to go away.
  Oooh, alright Ill talk to her.
 All right girls break it up, youre being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
 Dont say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
 Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh youre like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
 Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. Im  against violence in the workplace.
 Nobody cares what you think.
 So uh, you know what? I usually dont allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. Its yours. All day.
 Well, lets put em in the hallway. Give em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
 I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, thats the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when shes in Phoenix. Illuminating.
 This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, Im right on the other side of this wall.   used to be a window here. Theres not anymore. So, thats where I will be.
 So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just dont hesitate to ask. Im right here.
 Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the bucks.
 Its like a slang for Starbucks. Theyre all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we dont have the good stuff here.
 Nah, its not. its spppplllibbb
 No, heres the thing. Yknow I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and theyre always putting up walls and Im always tearing em down, just breakin down barriers, thats what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
 Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
  There ya go. Nice steaming cup ojoe.
 I have an idea.  Why dont I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
 Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
 Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
 You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that were all millionaires. Im probably closest. So heres Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
 Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
 I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe hed never heard that before he worked here?
 I know, its unbelievable.
 Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
 Toby, Katy.
 Tobys divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
 You and your wife, and you have kids.
 Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
 Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit.  Oh, shes cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
 I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule Just do it. Nike.
 Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?   So hows that uh, coffee from earlier?
 Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
 Busted.
 Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
 Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
 Oh, I know what youre thinking. Youre not prying this out of my hands, but dont tempt me because Ill give it to you!
 Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. Its a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. Its not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
  Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? Whats the matter?
 Oh, oh! God. Im sorry. Is there...?
 Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
 Seriously. No, really.
 God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean Im out of here at five sharp.
 I can go earlier. Cause Im the boss. You know, whatever. Im out of here slaves.
 What?
 Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five oclock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
 Excellent.
 Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.
 I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
 No its not. Because I could just click on the icon and then Im onto---
 No, no, no its not against the rules.  Shes not a permanent employee so its not.
 But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
 She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
 Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
 No. I cannot promise you that.
 Listen, Dwight.
  Dwight, no. I dont know. Its too early to tell. I dont know how I feel.
 Espresso?
 Youre welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
 Ummm-hmmm...
 Very easy to clean.
 Okay. Like hes going to win anyway, right?
 Did we get any mail?
 Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin. Just checkin, double checkin, checkin on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
 Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
 Ryan.
 Would you like to help me with a special project?
 Alright.
  Okay, just throw out all the empties.
 Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
 No.
 Uh, what flavor?
 Blues not a flavor.
 Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
 What, stop! Whoa! Thats my Drakkar Noir.
 No, it is a perfect smell-alike. Im not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
 Not its not, theres some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out.
 Thats over several months, Ryan.
 I think in order to be a ladies man, its imperative that people dont know youre a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I dont know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I dont know. I dont know. Maybe theyre right?  I dont know.
 Sure you dont want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
 See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
 Where you going?
 With us?
 Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
 Alright, have fun.
 Dont drink and drive.
 Take it easy.
 You too, have a good night.
 Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? Id pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
