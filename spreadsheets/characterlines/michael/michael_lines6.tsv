  Parkour!
  Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
 Parkoooooour!
  Whos getting married?
 If somebody doesnt tell me, Im gonna start screaming.
 Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
 Did everybody know about this but me?
  Okay... okay.
  Youll never guess what I know.
 Eric likes Megan.
  How do you know this?
  I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether its not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesnt exist. Or that the sport doesnt exist? I shouldve known. Poopball?
  Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."
 Im talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
 Yes
 Well...
  Stanley was on your group date?
  Does anybody else know about this?
||
 There he goes. There he goes.
 So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
 Nothing? Well I got a little somethin somethin. I dont know if I should say...
 Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
 Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
 Who?
||
  You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
 Stanleys wife is out of town.
 Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
  I dont get it!
 Drugs?
  Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
  Stanley is having an affir.
  I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebodys attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
  That and that are the same letter.
 No... no. Hes holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. Whats that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What havent you guessed?
 T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and theres another one right there. Just sound that out. Youre almost there.
  Hey, Stanley! Where you goin, big guy? Up to no good?
 No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. Im casting a movie and Im looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
 Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
  Did you hear Stanleys having an affair?
 Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and its really sad because everybody thinks youre a loser...
||
  Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair?
 So Its not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
  So stupid!
 I know, I know.
 Oh, I bet.
 Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
 Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say theyre going on sales calls and then go someplace else? Cause thats not cool.
  Im not saying... a damn thing.
  You can count on me.
  Oh, that smells good.
 Did you hear about Angela? Thats pretty weird.
 Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quiznos on the turnpike.
 Uh huh.  Alright?
  How do you un-tell something? You cant. You cant put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything thats been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." Its like the end of Spartacus. Ive seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still dont know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
 Yeah.
 Anorexia. Shes an anorexatic.
 Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
  Im worried about Erin, because shes not a very good worker. I dont know how long shes gonna last here.
 Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
 Mm hmm.
  Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
 Yeah!
  Guys, guys... you cant believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! Its just... theres no stalking it. Its a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
  Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
  Yeah, yeah... you know what? Lets discredit these rumors.
 Thats not important, Jim, I just think we shouldnt listen to any of that crap.
||
 Nowhere.
||
  Okay, I made it all up.
 Yes.
 But guys, Im a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that Im a J. Crew model.
 Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
 Because a lot of people think that models, even though theyre very attractive, are somewhat vapid. Its set our industry back quite a bit.
 Okay, okay... heres the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didnt want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
  The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this persons life, is that...
 Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you cant fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
 Yes. Jim...
 Look at that!  That is the inside of your vagina!
  How long have you known about the pregnancy?
 A week? A month? A year?
 Did you pee on a stick?
 You shouldve told me.
||
||
 Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
 No, I have to take it, or itll seem suspicious.
 No, no, I can do this.
 Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I wont talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
  Hey, what up, Cynthia?
 Hold on a second, Cynthia.
 Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you cant stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I dont think you should ever try.
    Yeah?
   Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
   Im going in for a procedure today.
   Yeah, its routine.  Im just a little bit scared.
   It is a colonoscopy.
   In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
   My main concern, should I have a safe word?
   Abso... you know what? Ill do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
   Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, Im gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and youll get it Weds.
   Oh right, this thing. I remember now.    Whats this about?
   Its okay with me but hes gonna want me in there.
   Really?
   Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like Im gonna blow my brains out.
   Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
   Hey let me escort you to your desk.
   You and Jim are close, huh?
   Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
   Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
   If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  Thats how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
   I just dont want you to lie to me.  I dont want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
   I just dont want you to.
    Uh huh, well if he doesnt like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, Im going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
   Sorry about that.  Whatd I miss?
    Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I dont.  Yes, I do!  No, I dont mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.   Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
   Yeah.
   Nope.
   No, I think theyre talking about me.
   What is Jim telling him?  That I cant handle this job?  That s bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
    How are your sales doin?
   Shhh, Im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room, okay?
   Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that Im completely overwhelmed.
   You know when they say its so crazy it just might work?  Well, I dont believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
   Be my eyes.
    Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin?
   Yes, definitely.
   Look who youre talking to.
   Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
      Permission to speak on the record?
   Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I dont think so.  Because Big Bird doesnt make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
   Very much, Jim is my best friend. But its his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
  Its not very well written, but you get the gist.
   I can just continue to run it myself.
   This was Jims idea?
   Wow.  Ummm, well Id have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
   I cant help but feel partially responsible.
    Little pick me up?   Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
   Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
   Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
   Hmmm, thats weird, thats weird... its kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy.
   Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
   Yes!
   Yes.
   Hey David, this is Michael Scott.    Michael Scott here.
   Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
   Absolutely,  not.   Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
   Wha... heres the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
   Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
   Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
   I never recommended you because I didnt want to lose you and I didnt want to lose Pam,  and now I dont wanna lose the baby.
   Thats what she...
   Kind of in the middle of something here.
   I, yeah... no, Ill tell him myself.  Lets both.
    Hello.
   No, its just us.
   Oh, oh, well here he is right now.    Come in.
   Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
   I like that, so manager and co-manager.
   Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
   Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
   Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
   Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
   Whats happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
 No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jims now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
 That is not big picture.
 ... Okay.
 That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
 Youre trying to trick me.
 Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
 Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because Id like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
 Yes?
 Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
 Welcome.
 Mm-hmm.
 Disruptive.
 No, I dont think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
 Lets do.
 N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
 Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasnt about planets...
 At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
 Because its a big universe, and were all just little, tiny specks of dust.
 You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, its light out, you wake up, its dark. Thats the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
 Yes.
 Alright. No more meetings this week.
 I can be very suprising.
 Mm-hmm?
 Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
 Stanley, you dont need to answer that.
 What do you mean by "these people"?
 Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
 Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
 What do you guys think?
 No, no, no, you dont need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
 That is not what Wallace told us.
 That is not the way I heard it.
 It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
 No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace.
 Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why dont we just--
 Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
 Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
 Which is it more of?
 I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
 No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
 Talk to you later--  Okay, you didnt let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this.
 I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I dont see you anymore.
 All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
 You know, theres no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and dont say anything about it.
 No, we can do it during the day. It doesnt have to be that dramatic, Jim.
 Jim, dont take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
 You use your brain too much.
 Sometimes the smartest people dont think at all.
 As I was saying it.
  Con-- you look like a nerd.
 Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
 Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that theres a calculator down there.
 That will not go over well.
 Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? Im gonna kill myself.
 No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
 And then another--
 Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
 Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
 Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
 Okay. Well, why dont you tell me what those are, Jim? Why dont you enliven me?
 Ah.
 Okay, heres a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
 Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why dont you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it.
  This had better be terrible.
 That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know its hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
 My plan-- a man-- panama.
 Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what were going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
 What about a raise based on merit?
 Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
 Are you making a--
 Toby.
 Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
 Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick?
 I... will skip a turn.
 I need more time.
 Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
||
  How you doing?
 Oh, what are you usually?
 Usually a ten, but Im feeling like a zero.
 I know, I know.
 Yes, we did.
 Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.
 Youre welcome.
 Gin.
  Just pretend were not here.
  What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
 Its just a really important day for me.
 Thanks.
 Yes she does. Yes she does. Were all gonna go and were gonna have a good time.
 No.
 And, hey, dont embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
 Dont. Dont. Dont. You stole my joke. Dont steal my joke.
 Yes. I said that yesterday.
 Dwight...
 No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, thats my joke.
 This is what Im talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
 Pam and Jims wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
 Get out of here.
 Oh, my God, Dwight.
 Theres... a name.
 Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
 Is that all you have on her?
 Youre an idiot.
  Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
 Those glasses are super dark.
 Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
 You did?
 That was nice of you.
 Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
 Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
 No. No. Thats not how it works.
 Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
 Mmm-hmm.
 I dont have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
 Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
 Im staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
 I would do the same for you.
 Yes.
 Yes... just go--
 Oh. Thank God.
 Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you cant. And Ill tell you why.
 If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, shes going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
 Ok.
 I dont have a room?
 Ok. Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.
 Jerk.
 When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we dont know what happens because that story hasnt been told yet.
 Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
 Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
 You... are... kidding me.
 Im not a physics major, Stanley. Im just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
 Thats rude.
 You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shes very conservative. So, mums the word.
 How ya doin?
 Nice to meet you.
 Whos doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
 That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
 Didnt move my lips.
 Head table, where I belong.
 Well, whos that one?
 What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
 They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
 Thats not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasnt gonna make a toast and Im not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? Im so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car. Thats not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
 Thats a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
 Thats not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
 And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesnt have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
 Yeah. Go ahead.
  Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, theyre living together, theyre having lots of consentual sex--
 Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You cant expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, its just a different sensation.
 When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say its not different, but its a different sensation.
 When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. Its not necessarily different for the woman--
 ...but its different for the-- ok. Ok.
 Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
 Jim.
 That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
 I know. I cant believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
 I have not found that to be the case.
 Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
 Theres gonna be a free room?
 Hi, Mema. Its Michael.
 Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
 I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks shes better than everybody.
 Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.
 Youre welcome.
 Oh. Isnt he terrible? May I? Heres the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. Its not 1890 anymore. Its modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. Thats part of life.
 Exactly.
 I know.
 Theyre gonna name the baby after you, you know. Theyre gonna call it Mema.
 Yes, and if its a boy they will call it Sylvio.
 What are you wearing?
 Looks like youre going to a fish fry, Dwight.
 Ok.  Thats not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Lets go.
 Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. Its not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
 Yes.
 Why?
 Oh, my God. Twins. Im sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
 Theyre men, Dwight.
 Something is wrong with you.
   Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.
  I love you!
 Mmm!  Its after midnight.
 Oh my God.  Youre not going to be able to talk back.
  Shell be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "And... and clip my toenails."
  Now you sound like Kermit.
  Why dont you take a picture.  Itll last longer.  God.  Cant I get a little privacy?
  Hey, good morning.   Its about damn time.  I havent gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.    Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
   How can you eat like that?
  Yeah, Im hungry, but Im not going to make a pig out of myself.
  She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
 She was from Europe.
 Uh-huh.
 No.
 Wait a second.  Youre not into her?  Are you kidding me?
  Shes Pams best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
  No... youre crazy.
  Shes-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of peoples teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure theyre not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--
    I already have my European girlfriend.
 Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.    And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
  Hey, hey... Hes not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
 Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
   Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  Youre a mom.  I just figured you might have--
 Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
 Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?
  Im sorry.  Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
  my weekend was bad so far.
  I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
 And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
  It is a terrible year for love.
  Im thinking about having my sperm frozen.
 Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually.   There you go.  Use it in good health.
   Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
 Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
 The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because youre mental, if you dont have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
 Get out.
 Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you cant just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  What topics can you use for small talk?
 Mmhm.
 Mmhm.
 Yes, what else?
 No.
 Yeah! Thats good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Lets do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
 All right...
 Okay, okay. God. What you people dont know about business, I could fill a book with.
 What?
  The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, Im not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
 Oh hi. Im sorry, just a sec.  Erin, youre supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
 Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
 Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. Youre seeing how the sausage gets made.
 Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
 Mmhm.
 Yep.
 Okay.
 There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. Its like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
 Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
 Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
 Okay, well.
 Do your worst.
  Oh, great.
 Mmhm.
 Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
 No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
 There is no such things as monsters.
 Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
 I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
 He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
  Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
 Okay.
 Um it is, Grotti.
 Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
 Im not gonna lock my door.
 Its Grotti. Hes following up.
  "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."
 Yeah.
 Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
 Okay, Im calling the police.
 All right.
 Shh!
 Thats not gonna happen.
 What am I supposed to do here?
 I was thinking exactly the same thing.
 I dont know, I dont know about that.
 Hold on, hold on! Just-
 All right. I will meet with him, but Im not going alone.
  What are you wearing? Whos Pat?
 Lets go, come on.  God!
 Forget it! Forget it!
  Take that thing off the table! Please!
 Oh my God!
 Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
 Hello.
  Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
 Yes.
 Well.
 Okay.
 Thats not true.
 Okay shut up.
 I will have the gabba-gool.
 The gabba-gool.
 I dont, I dont have to have that.
 Guys, guys-
 Thats okay.
 Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
 If the salad is on top, I send it back.
 I dont think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
 No, no no, no. Come on. Im sorry, were having our salad.
 Hey, do you need any help?
 Hes a good mechanic.
 I dont...
 Okay, okay okay.
 Yep, all right.
 Put it down.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Its just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
 I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
 It was a lot of snap decisions.
 Yes!
 Just get in the car.
 Jim?
 Oh thank God.
 It wasnt easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think Im in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
 Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so Im turning to you my friend.
 Okay!
 Jim? Are you?
 What? Wait, I didnt hear a thing you just said.
 No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
  No!  Oh my God!
 No, Jim please, repeat what youre saying! I cant understand you!
  Jim?!?  Oh my God.
 Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I cant afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
 Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
 All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
 No. Hes not. Hes just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still dont understand how this works.
 But Grotti acts like hes mafia though.
||
 If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldnt tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
 This is Scott.
 Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
 Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. Im actually kind of POd.
 I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
 I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
 You suck!
 And Im not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
 How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
 Doubt it.
 What a tool.  What?
 No. What do you mean?
 What?
 Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But Im not.
 So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then theyre already dead." I said something like that.
 Erin?
 Coffee?
 Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If its not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
 Large. If its a medium I send it back. If its an extra large I send it back.
 Go.  Any questions?
 Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
 Is someone there? I cant see you because Im blind.
  It is?
 Theyre back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!
 And oh, Jim...
 Oh, I havent see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
 Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character Ive been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
||
 I have recently taken a lover.
 Pams mom.
 Pams mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
 About what?
 Oh, big time.
 She drives a green camry.
 And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
  What?
 Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
 Get the hell out of here, idiot.
 I think youre underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
 Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
 Shes right on my way home from work.
 I di- alright, Ill take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
 Yeah.
 Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
 Sure. Thanks for asking.
  Oh, wow.
 That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
 Erin, look.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, no, its nobody.
  Hmm... no.
 I dont.
  I dont deserve this, guys.
 No, I dont.
||
 I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
 Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
 It is.
 You want me to be happy?
 Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
 More than a friend, a co-worker.
 Its okay.
 That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
 Okay.
  Feels good.
 Im sleeping with Pams mom. Sometimes, dinner.
   Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
  That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and Im not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other peoples needs ahead of our own.
  Who wants to help the world one step at a time?   Alright, good.
  Alright, thats...
  Alright...
  Okay, Im out of here,  see you later guys...
  Ok, oh no heres an idea... conservation...
  Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?
   Can you hold down the fort?    Hey boo!
   Whats it... why are you crying?
   No, no, no, Ill talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, Ill let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
   Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
  For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
  Alright, in my defense...
  Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly Im outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  Im caring, Im generous, Im sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
  Lets get back to the matter at hand.
  No, no, no... no, no...
  I dont like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
  Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
  I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
   Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
  Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, Im sorry.
  Can I sit down for a second?
  This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
  She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
  Really?  Would you do that?
   Youre a good, good guy.
  No... thats...
  I dont... um... I cant hear your conversation.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... youre a jackass.    Hey, hey, you know what?  Youre just as stubborn as your mother, when you dont wanna do something you just dont do it.
  You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
  Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how were gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
  Well, that is not gonna happen!
  Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
  You know what?  Im gonna start dating her even harder.
  You know what it means.
  I dont need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pams mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, whats her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
   Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
  Night Erin.
 Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
 Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Dont worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
 I am going to scare these kids so bad.
 Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
 Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
 It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
 Who wants candy?
 ...and then I think Im going to go to the Garlic Festival.
 Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
 They have a TCBY booth.
 The same stuff you get downtown.
 Do you like TCBY?
 I cant believe its- I cant believe its yogurt. Uh... itll be fun
 You should give them a call. Check that out.
 Jims a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
 Wha- what?
 Why dont they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I dont understand.
 I dont want you to feel like Im baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
 Let me get your stroller.
 What are you gonna call him?
 No. What is his name?
 Mr. Bourchard. Theyre very formal.
 Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
 ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
 They are into style.
 They are into appearance. We are selling success.
 Thats sorta secondary.
 Alright. Hi. Any messages?
 Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
 It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasnt.
 It rained.
 Nothing. Cocoa.
 Good. Yep.
 Ok. Thank you.
  Yeah?
 Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, whats going on?
 Uh... I cant really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
 It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
 No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
 Not yet!
 No it is- dont! Im not gonna bump. Im not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
 Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
 Oh. He did? What did he say?
 Ok.
 Thank you, Stanley.
 Ok.
 Yes.
 I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
 I know what a flounder is.
 Im not usually the butt of the joke. Im usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and hed have to put on my suit and itd be too short and hed look... Damn it! Hed still look good.
 The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been Koi-ponded? Who heres been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
 Uh...
 You never said anything.
 Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, Stop because I want you to stop or STOP as in Stop. Youre making me laugh so hard. What youre doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!
 We are going to make a Do Not Mock list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? Im gonna kick it off. Lets see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
 Your nose?
 Alright.
 No. I havent finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? Thats it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybodys getting their chance.
 Ok. Thats to broad. Its gotta be something else. How bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
 Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And dont sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
 Ok.
 Its a fish.
 It couldve died of natural causes. So...
 Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
 What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
 No, no.
 No. We are not done here. This-
 No, Jim. You dont understand. Things like this dont just die. Kids in high school still call me Ponytail.
 Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
 I want to make fun of you right now.
 No. Dont do that. Youre not. Youre not stupid.
 Oh, my God.
 Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
 Well, you know what? Youre right, Phyllis, but Ive been there before. Ive seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. Thats the problem.
 Its ok. Were having fun. Its not actually the first time Ive been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, Who are your 5 friends? and Im, like, Uh...  I didnt even know I couldnt even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I dont even have Jans cell phone number and I hate her! She wont give it to me. I was like, Oh, I guess Im a loser. A luh-whooooo a za her.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
 Hey. Who wants to watch Michaels pond dive? My roommates friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and hes bringing it over.
 Is this the tape of me falling?
 No. Its ok. Watch it. He cant fire all of you.
 Its alright. I can handle it.
 I am a grown-up, Jim.
 I dont think you froze.
 Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
 Oscars a douche.
 No. Hes a- yeah, hes alright. Ok.
 Youre welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell.
 Morning Dwight.
 No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didnt want hers.  Because I guess Im the only aphrodisiac she needs.
 Well, yeah...
 It worked.
  I dont mind if I do.
 Im taking one for my lady friend.
 Brain food. Thank you very much.
  My girls.  There they are.
  Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  Itll cure all of your "Gee I dont know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I dont really see them together".  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.
 Yeah--
  I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
 No, that wouldnt be--
  Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
 Hey--
  Please, Kevin.  Youre fired.    Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
  Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldnt even be talking about business today.
  Today is about family.
  Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.
  What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
 What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
  Not about taking credit.  Lets just say we all did it.
  Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
 Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.
  Thats funny.
  Youre 54 years old.
  Youre 58 years old?
 Congratulations.
  The only time you should care about a womans age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
  That--
 Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
 Helene?
 I am.  Im definitely going to do it.  Ive already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
 So its a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  Its not anything you would have ever done.
  Well theres no jumping in a triathlon.
  Youre thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
 Snowboarding?
 I might.
   Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I dont know.
 Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
 So we should get the check?
 Oh, no, no, no. No.  Its stupid.  Youd hate it.  I hate it.
  Yes you will.
  I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.
  Thats just an arbitrary title.
  Its not amazing... at all.  Its sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish wont come true, so that blows.
 Oh that I plagiarized I think.
  Well, thats because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  Its a generational-- sort of gap between us.
  That was a bunt.
 Oh, just went to the bathroom.
 I got thirsty.
  Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.
  Finish your cake, Helene.
  I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
  Helene I think youre a wonderful person and I-- God-- Ive enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pams feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
  No its not.
  Wow.  That just-- youve really grown.
  Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  Ive never-- I dont know him.  Theres another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
 And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
  Its not my decision.  Its mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--   -- tility.
  Well, hobbies--
  Pamela Beesly Halpert--
 May I have a word with you in my office please?
 Well, this is a work related matter.
 Yes.
 Yes.  Join me please, wont you?   I am going to give you a raise.
 Because of all the good work youve done.
  Thats-- no, no-- its not about numbers, Pam.  Its about attitude.
  Do you want the raise or what?
 Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.    And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
 No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying dont-- unless I havent offered you enough... your face isnt changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pams brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
  What?
  Oh-- okay , what? I dont-- Are you kidding?
 Ye-- No.  Alright.  Ill take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
  Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
  See you.
 Hey.
 Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--
 What punch?
 Im pretty sure we said slap.
 I-- mmm-- Im good.
  Hey.
 Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
 I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
 Really?
 She strong?
 Can you stop this?
 Okay.
 I dont either.
 Mmm-hmm.  I know.
 You gotta do something--
 How much time do you think youll need?
 Come on, man!
 Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdos pay dominatrixs hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  Im scared Im gonna love it.   Lets do this.
 Its okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
 Youre just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
 Yes.
  I know.  Okay.  Alright.   Oh-- God!
 Okay!  Pam, Pam-- Im really sorry.  Im sorry.
 So many things.  I dont know.  Its hard to choose.
 Maybe that--
 Yes.
  Okay.  I promise.   For the record your mom came on to me.
 No!
  I dont know.
 As I watched Pams big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesnt sound like much, but its enough for me.
 Ahh...
 Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.
  No.
 What are you talking about--
  Forget that.
  No.
  Oh that feels better.
  But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
  You did?
  That sounds like it was hilarious.
  Yes?
  Youll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
  Woo hoo, shout out!
  Erin, do we have the journal?
  Did you?
 Oh, the Wall.
  Its $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say?
  No, no, that doesnt make any sense.
  Oh, that sounds awful.
  Oh God.  Well, thats an interesting theory.
  Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.   Oh my God, wouldnt that be hilarious!
  OK, OK.  Good.  Ill catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye.   Hes busy, hell call me back when hes free.
  No, Im just poopin.  You know how I be.
  Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
  OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesnt even need to be good.  Oh God, I cant think, need more Mullins.
 Monkey see, monkey do.
  Monkey pee all over you.
  We have a monthly staff meeting
  What? Oh my God!    There has been a murder.  Theres been a murder in Savannah.
  Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I dont think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
 It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
  This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, its about murder.
  Tube City, you owe me one.
 There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
  Sandwich platters.
 Baby carrots.
  OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
  OK, use your imaginations.
  Its not scary.
  Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
   Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?
  Whos Michael?  Im Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
  That is the way Southern people talk.
  Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
  No, no, no. Dont turn this into a political thing.
  Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
 I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
   Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
  Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
   Whoa. Whats this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This heres Savannah.
  No no no no no no no.  Im going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
   Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- thats a misdirection.  We still dont know who the murderer is.   Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I cant do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
  I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Yall skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
  No it aint.
 I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
  This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
  You are out of order.
  You are-
   Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
  Cant wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
  To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
  Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
  No Michael here, my name is-
  No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright?
   Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?
  Detective Wallace?
  Aw, shucks, tell him Im not here.
  No, I only answer to Detective Wallace cause I got a warm body in the other room.
  A murder, you say?  I do declare.
  Get in there!
  There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.   Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
  On the count of three were all going to put down our guns.
  Well put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
  One, two, three..
  Ok. Ok. How bout this?
 I want it to be better than Great, Pam. How bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.
 Nope. Then my face is down. They cant see my face.
 Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if titles important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholders meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
 Ok. Obviously Im not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
 I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? Its not even a twirl, its a spin. I might do the spin.
 Ok, Oscar, I dont need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
 Well, could you condense it please?
 Its not a limo. Its a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
 They sent a limo.
 Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when theyre in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
  Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
 Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
 Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because youre invited and youre invited and youre invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
 What?
 The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
  Mmm... whoa.
  I wish the windows werent tinted so people could see us in here.
 Definitely.
 Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. Thats bigger than my bed.
  Whos playing with the button?
 I will have to answer.
 No, no. Thats too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, Well, were sort of on thin ice.  I wont say that. Ill something like that.
 Oh, my god. This is it.
 Yes.
 Oh, hi.
 Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
 Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
 See you later.
  Officers. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Hello.
 Thank you.
 Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
 Its nice to meet you, too. Its an honor and a privilege.
 Ah.  Your eminence.
 You guys ever protect the president?
 What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
 Rock and roll.
  This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
  Were going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry.
 Hey, hey, hey. Im sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. Thats -
 Yes.
  Yeah, well, thats not gonna happen. Thats not gonna happen. Well be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that youre mad at me and youre mad at all them -
 Ok. Alright. We are gonna - were gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. Were gonna come back with a plan for you. Its a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. Its a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You.
 Wow. Things are really picking up.
 What?
 I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
 We tell them the plan, right?
 Heres what were gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
 Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
 I am the guy who roused that crowd.
 Got them on their feet.
 They were so happy down there.
 Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
 Well, Im texting him, so.
 Its done.
 Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Dont be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why dont you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.
 Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
 Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
 Its all good. Its all good stuff. Lay it on them.
 That wasnt what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
 O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?
 Wow, man. That -
 That was embarrassing.
 For me, too. You embarrassed me.
 Well, that was a waste of a text. Lets get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We dont seem to have a plan so Im thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
 Uh, Im not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... youre the moron.
||
 Yes it is a thrill to be honored by ones company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, Wow. Great job.  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So were leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
  Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
 Yeah, Have a seat.
 Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
 I have it on good authority that you said the following.   Can you read that back to me?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Okay.
 You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand."
 You cant be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
 Okay, who said that?
  Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what its worth I think your baby voice is tops.
  Youre welcome, baby.
 Keep.
 I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
 Keep.
 For what?
 Oh okay.  I dont know how those got on there...
 Must be hackers.
 What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
 Worse than that.
 Lurk much?   I miss Pam.
 Is that what were going for now?  "okay?"  We used to go for "pretty good."
 Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  Im not in this for the trophies, but...
 Well, technically, Im a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
  It would look good, on my mantle.
 There you are.  I dont think we have finished with my Inbox.
 To change lives.
 Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I cant go through with this.
 Well...
 No.
 I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didnt want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  Ive made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
 Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
 Im not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids Id pay for college.  Okay, all right.
 Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of...
 Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
 Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
 Good to see you.  Wheres your saxaphone?
 Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
 Well, you didnt even hear it.
 Oh, good.
 Sure.
 Oh, yeah.
 No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
 Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldnt go in there.  Im pretty busy, I should just...
 Oh.
 Wow!
  Oh, God.  Oh, God.
 All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I dont think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, Ive done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm.  Should we go?
 Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know whats invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know whats gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, youre going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... Im sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
 Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition.  Im so, so sorry.
 Im sorry.  Im sorry.  Im so sorry.
 I lied to myself too.  Im not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasnt even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I dont know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
 Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I cant pay for your college.  But you dont have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
 Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Theyre lithium.
 Erin, can you give us a second?
 Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, Im sorry.
 What can I do?
 I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
 Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
 Really? Wow.  Thats over $200 a year.
 For-okay, okay heres what Im gonna do.  Im going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  Im going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause Ive got monies to move around.
 Thats a lot of zeroes.
 Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
 Yes.
 Youre what, like, 12?
 I think youre doing a great job.
 What do you want from this job, provided the company doesnt go out of business?
 Really?
 You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
 Yeah.  I just sortve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
 Heeeeeeres Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.
 What the hell is going on?
 Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
 Phyllis?
 Take it back. That is absurd.
 No? No! Jim! Come on!
 Its insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesnt it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
 Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
 If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and shed ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. Its a good thing Russia doesnt exist anymore.
  Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, Im the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
 No its not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, whats your name?
 Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
 Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
 What would you like for Christmas little boy?
 What did you think was going to happen?
 All right, just say "some toys" please.
 Damn it Kevin, come on.
 Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
 Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesnt have to go through this again.
 Ryan come here!
 Come on, come on.
 Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!
 Just sit down!
 Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
 Whoop! Okay, what?
 Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
 Do you understand, you forced my hand?
 Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why dont "we" take a vote on it?
 Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
 No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
 Ill get some punch. That looks delicious.
 I dont ask for much for Christmas, I really dont. Its not like Im begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or Im gonna kill myself."  Thats not - I dont care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, dont look at me.
 Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, thats great. Im excited by that. And those of you who dont, I forgive you. But I never forget.
 Oh the Anti-Christ!
 Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what youre saying?
 Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
  Uh oh, whats Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
 Oh yes. Its space garbage. Dwights gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
  Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adulterys a sin, look it up in the Bible people. Whatd you get?
  Oh, thats appropriate. Lot of fire where youre going. Better get used to it. Youre going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. Youre going to Hell Stanley.
  I cant see from here people. Somebody shout it out, dont make me get up.
  Thats fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
  No!
  Andy had Erin.
  What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.
 David, guess who Im sitting here dressed as.
 Ill give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
 Im Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
 What?
 Really? Whats going on?
 What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
 Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
 What does that mean?
 Well, cant Alan protect you?
 All of us?
 Oh my God.
 Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And thats one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
 Hey. Hows everybody doing?
 That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
 You know whats even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Heres my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
 I dont want to say. But, "its fun to stay at the -"
 "Its fun to stay at the -"
  Mmm, mm mm mm.
 You know what, Christmas isnt about Santa, or Jesus. Its about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, youre my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, youre our mailman. And I cant help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?"
 Its not... Nevermind. Nothing.
 I didnt say anything!
 Were going out of business!
 David told me on the phone. David told me.
 Earlier today.
 He said, we have been sold.
 Dwight! Jesus!
 Davids gone. Alans gone. Were all gone.
 Its hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
 Ill call him. Ill call David.
 Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
 He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them Im a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
 Its not sweetie, its Michael Scott.
 Stephanie could you hop off please?
 David!
 David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
 David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
 Well I think were past that now.
 Were not fired?
 Yeah!  Its a Christmas miracle!
 Woo hoo!
 Oh! You got it? What is that?
 Huh. Well, maybe those will help.
 Hi Santa.
 Id like to make a wish.
 I would like an Xbox, and a TV thats compatible with an Xbox. And, Im sorry.
 You called Bob?
 Come on! Phyllis!
 Okay.
 Oh God. Get a room Santas!
 Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
 Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... Im... pretty nervous about it. And... Im... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
  I see youve met Computron, our virtual helper. Im Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
 What is the worlds largest ocean?
 Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
 That is fantastic. Its good, but its not good enough. Keep working. And heres Pam. Shes our international sales consultant.
 Hello, Stanley.
 Ok. Well, I thought Id show you around a little bit -
 - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Coopers Seafood. You like lobster? Youve had lobster before, right?
 They make the best Maine lobster in the world. Youll love it.
 No, Computron, actually I think Coopers is the best. Youre gonna love it.
  Oh, my God.
 Alright. Excuse me.  If you will -
 - follow me this way. Ill introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.
 I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Tobys favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
 Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin? Whatcha guys talkin about?
 Stuff. I love stuff.
 HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
 Ah.
 Talkin bout, uh, what?
 Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
 Oh, time and resources.
 No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.
 This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that?
 Thats, that is true.
 I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?
 I dont care if he goes and files a report and says that were nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
 Computron, Im gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
 Just - sh -
 Shut -
 Shut up. Shut up.
  Sittin in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin.
 So check out how we live
 They call it Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that cause of the electricity. The citys laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if youre bitten by a spider.
 Plenty of space in the parking lot.
 Snack attack time.
 We like Cuginos
 They call it Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 Ugh.
 Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how bout you?
 Its from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder whats inside. Scissor me.
  Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.   They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didnt need them touching our asses.
 Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
 Cool. What next?
 Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
 Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
 And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
 And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.
 Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
  Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
 Alright, hes on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
 Why do I have to explain everything?
 Okay.
 Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
 You know what, Dwight? Lets give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
 Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
 In training.
 Were very excited too, arent we guys? Right?
 We have a little song prepared for you.
 Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
 Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
 Saber.
 Wow. Really terrific.
 Perfect.
 No. Dont like that.
 Mm, nope. Dont like that.
 Well still get to use the little cups, though, right?
 I dont know what theyre made of.
 You know what cant fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everythings running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
 There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
  Really? You dont have enough water in there? Your stomach?
 What?
 I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
 I dont want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabres doing for us.
 Well, you should have a little. But its great that you dont, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but Im - Ill be honest, Im having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of em.
 All of them.
 So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. Im good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
 Hello. No. My names Michael Scott. Hello.
 Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
 Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
 Ok. I feel very strongly that you cant just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. Hed know what to do.
 I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
 I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry.
 I hope youre not busy doing something.
 You sure?
 You look great too.
 Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
 Hey. Wow.
 Really loud.
 Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend.
 Can I just stay here and never go back?
 Oh, man. How much time do you have?
 Yeah.
 Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought Id come by, see...
 I dont know.
 Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They dont let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
 Exactly. What are you thinking?
 It is a tough one.
 Yeah. But one would be good.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So the kids making the noise to pick it up.
 Oh, okay.
 No, I think it is-
 Yep.
 The what?
 Oh, okay.
 Like it.
 There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of em.
 See you later.
 Bye now.
 Thanks for having me.
 Well, thats not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallaces house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
 Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabes homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
 You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. Thats the best thing? Really? Ugh.
 Well, Im not really one for making speeches.
 But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
 No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
 Heres my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
 Heres the toast. Im gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
 Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. Thats like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesnt it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
 Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
 Okey doke.
 What?
 No.
 No.  Were trying to look it up right now.
 Um, come on.
 Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. Ive always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
 Oh.
 Thats it!
 Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
 Okay, put it on my card.
 Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so shes gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
  Why hello!
 Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
 Jo, I dont know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
 Whoa, whoa!
 And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
 Forget the question...
 I humbly accept the management position.
 Because, well, Jim. Where Im from, two types of folk those who aint, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type aint you aint? Yall come back now.
 Yes.
 No, we know. Texas!
 I could manage my way around that.
 I will try to manage my excitement!
 I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I cant even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.
 Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
 What?
 What? Really?
 Wow!
 La la la, hello Oscar!
 What are you reading?
 Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I cant keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
 Why, is there an untapped gay market?
 ...Where did you get that information.
 Manuel who?
 Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
 Son of a bitch.  Pardon me.
 Okay.
 Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
 Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you cant take the sales out of salesman.
 No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
 Im turning myself in right now!
 Thank you.
 Great! Thats great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
 How is that possible?
 No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
 Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.
  It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentlemans club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
 Why not? Its part of the sales experience.
 Well, okay...
 What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
 No, Im serious, we dont have to put up... Is it the dogs?
 You know what, we dont have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
 No, this is geological.
 Are you kidding me?
 And you guys are okay with this?
 Oh my God.
 Hey.
 You know, its funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now Im out there, and I wish I was in here.
 Yeah. Except theres no grass out there. Its just a farty dirt patch.
 I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
 We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, thats stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
 Lethal Weapon?
 What? What Im saying...
 And weirdly Im a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.
 Alright!
 Oh, it smells good in here.
 Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
  Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  Shes contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
  Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
  Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
  Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
  Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I dont want to know.  Tell me later.  Lets go!  Lets go!  Hospital!
  Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Dont get revenge on me, nerd.
  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You cant tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
  Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Lets go!
  Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
  The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body.
  I will allow that.
  Okay.
  Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
  Yes, Phyl?
   Nope, nope, I dont think anybody wants to see that.
    That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
    Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
  Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Lets have happy times.
  Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And Im thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
  Okay, nobody touch Pams nipples.  Think of Pams nipples as Tobys grundle.
  Okay, yeah, why dont you go get it?
  Okay, the opposite of that?
  Ooh, someones freakin.
  I think he is.
  Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, its time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
  435.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didnt have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Lets go to the hospital, shall we?
  We can do...
  Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
  What is October feast?
  Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and its time to go to the hospital.
  Thats right, lets do this.
  Lets go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
  Are you kidding?
  You can do this.  You can do this.
  Im scared, too.
  Yeah.
  Were going to have a baby.
  Lets do that.
  Two minutes apart.
  Its okay.
  I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
  Were okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
  Youre not going to.  You know where youre going?
  Yes, you are.  And you know what youre going to have?
  Yes!  Were going to the hospital and were going to have a baby.
  I got it!  I got it!  Everybody its go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
  No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
  Yes.
  Go bag! Wheres my go bag?  Wheres my go bag?
  You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
  No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
  Thank you!  Wish me luck!
   Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
  Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  Were going now!
  No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
  Dwight, what is the traffic like?
  Alright.
  Geesh, Dwight!
  What!?
  Where?
  By the bushes?
  Okay, go, go, go, go!
  Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
  Yeah?
  Im texting about you, okay!?
  Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.    Ready?
  Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
  Okay.
  Okay.
  Do you have everything, guys?
  Okay, alright.
  Dunder-Mifflin.  Its okay.    I just did.
  Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
    Okay, not yet, not yet.  Im going to go wash my eyes.
  That kids going to have a lot of hair.
  I think its going to be any minute now.
  Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
  Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
    Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
  Youre starting, youre kinda losing them.
    Yeah, thats right.  Its a baby, see?
  Okay.  You cant smoke anywhere these days.
  Guys, guys!
  Eleven pounds...
  Thank you!  Thank you!
  Wheres the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
  Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
  Love you, as a friend.
  Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
  Alright.
  Oh, okay.
  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
  There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
  Who else here is single?
  I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
  Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you dont have any?    Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
  Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, youre obviously single.
  Andrew, what about you?
  Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
  What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
  I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
  Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop em in your mouth.  Why dont you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
  Good!
  Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
  Bye.
  Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
  Im not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
  No, Kevin doesnt have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it wont kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
  Just dont let him sit on you...  Im kidding.  Youll have fun.  Itll be good.  Itll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
  Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
  Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
  Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And Im surprised that you didnt question me in the first place.
  No.
  Lynn was as hot as Erin.
  This isnt about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
  Kev...  Nice.  Going.
    There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think Im going to be sick...
 Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Natures Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. Itll be a good day.
 It is St. Patricks Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
 Morning, honey-pile.
 It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
 Yes it is!
 No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
 Mm, that sounds great, actually.
 When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I dont care if youre a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
 That is a great idea JB.
 Oscar, homosexual accountant.
 Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
 Okay.
 Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! Were very proud of you. You know what, were gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
 Oh no! Say its not so, Jo, were gonna miss you, were gonna miss you so much!
 Well, I am heading down there.
 How about July 4th weekend?
 I did!
 You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
 All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
 Lets follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesnt like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
 Hello. I want you to stop what youre doing right now. You are stressed, and Im taking you to lunch.
 No is not an option.
 All right. Well if you need me, Ill be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
  Ill be over there.
 Very nice.
 A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jos eye. Howd you make that happen?
 Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
 How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
 Okay. All right.
 Hey there. So I think Im done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
 Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
 Right. What?
 Mm. mm. Oh well.
 No, no, no. Thats super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
 Hey Pack-man.
 How you doing stud? You already there?
 Hows the lady situation?
 Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
 Yeah. Maybe next year.
 How late do we have to work tonight?
 Why does she do that? Why doesnt she just tell you what your schedule is?
 Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I wouldve turned thirty. Thats just - thats just depressing.
 Hello Jo.
 There is, as a matter of fact. Its getting sorta late. Its 830. And its St. Patricks Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided Im going to dismiss my employees.
 Im thrilled with the work theyve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
 Okay. Happy St. Patricks Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
 Yes.
 Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
 Drinks are on me!
 Oh -hoh! All right.
 Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I dont know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Dont worry, be happy."
 Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?
 Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is?
 Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
  I am flattered. Thats Johnny Depp.
 In my condo complex.
 I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
  Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
 Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
 No. Im Captain Jack Sparrow.
 Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, its not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought youd seen Roger Clemens?
 Yeah. Well, it wasnt him.
 I know, I know.
 I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
  First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you dont have a pet, please dont feel like -
 Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meetings not over.
 No sales topic per se.
 Dwight?
 I would like your undivided attention, please.
 Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think its kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
 Yeah.
 M-hmm.
 Is that all you have to say to me?
 Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. Its a big cheque.
 Stop sexting Pam. Im trying to congratulate you.
 You writing your memoirs over there?
 Well, its a pretty big check.
 Okay. Dont gloat. Heres the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
 Im just saying, that -
 Honey and jelly sandwich time.
 Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. Thats -
 You saw who did this and you didnt stop them?
 The sales department smashed my sandwich.
 You dont get it.
 Thats what she said.
 Yeah.
 Thank you very much.
 Ah, just the stupid leads.
 Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what Im thinking? Im thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you dont. Not even Sabre owns this place. Its a rental. Im kind of sick of the attitude around here. Im sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.
 Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
 They act like I have no power.
 Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
 Exactly that.
 Exactly that.
 Hello. May I have everyones attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so Im going to give the leads to... King Creed!
 - and to King Meredith!
 And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens .
 Im giving them the leads, Phyllis.
 Hey.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids dont respect the father who doesnt respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
 I do understand it.
 Or is it?
 Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldnt be in this business.
 Well, bigshot, If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes.
 Wait. What day is today?
 Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
 Okay. You know what, lets just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, cmon, shotgun in my car -
 Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, theyre now in the city dump."
 Well, thats not the way its going t sound. Heres what were going to do. Well go to the dump, well look around, then well all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
 Really?
 Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!
 You can.
 Okay fine, I get it. Ill just go by myself.
 You know, Dwight, there was a time when youd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
 Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you dont believe me, look in my gutters.
  Youve changed, man.
 Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
 No, Im talking about your personality, Dwight.
 Assistant to the managed him -
 Yeah.
 You think you would have done better without me? Really?
 Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldnt have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
 You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
  Thats my wife youre talking about, man.
 If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
 No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!
 Dont even think about that
 Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god.
 Were never going to find those leads, are we?
 This  Why would somebody throw that out?
 Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?
 Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. Thats it. And the caption would read
 In the dump.
 No! Better!
How many is that?
Count the last one.
Oh, new record!
Oh, what did you do today?
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
My respect.  Okay, Ill make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Gets to go home.  Ooh! I say dance, they say how high? Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high.  Disqualified!
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
 Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Yeah, Im betting one more.
Good.
Alright, alright.
Well, its not exactly fair. Hes got all of his weight thats helping him go down.
Yes?
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
Ok, yes. Sure.
No, I got that.
I am in.
Its a deal.
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!
Its not a birthday, its not a good-bye party...
Sucks to be you.
That would be sublime.
Yes.
Hello, how are you?
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
So, what do you do?
Really?
See, I didnt think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
About what?
Shes nice.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, sure.
About what?
 Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.
Guys, come on, Im on a date. Let me do my thang.
Hi, Im date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?
Hey, guys, guys, guys.  Watch this. Ready?
Im tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
 Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, why dont you send the bill to 23 I Dont Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Hey, she can tell Im on a date, right? Right? Im just having fun.
Really? You told on me. Thats lame.
Yes. Homelessness. What?
Where?
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. Im just kidding around. Im sorry.
She cant talk to us that way.
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Well, I am starting it again!
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and Im gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I dont see that from you.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
Ive written all of it... in my head.
If youre really interested, its called Somehow I Manage and theres going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
I own a Chrysler.
No, you shut up.
Grenadine.
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
No, no.
No, its Michael Scott.
He is I.
Oh, hey guys.
Hey, Julie! You having fun?
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
I think I did. But I cant take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
 Im going to give Erin $15.
 A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
 Shes kind of a rube.
 Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Ill take her to lunch.
  Hi, Erin. Happy Secretarys Day.
 I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
 Ugh.
 Well, Hayworths is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So Im...
 Okay, well, well figure something.
  Okay, lets go to Hayworths.
 All right.
  Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? Im kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
  I dont know.
 Ahhh.
 Right.
 An age or month?
 Ive been trying. Ive been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
 So how are things going with Andy?
 Well, lets see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
 Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I dont think he is a snappy dresser.
 I dont think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
 Mm-hmm. You didnt know that? Oh.
 Okay.
 I dont know. Probably didnt want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
 They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?
 Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
 Thank you.
 Mm-hmm. Yeah.
 Well...
 What are you doing? What are you doing?
 Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybodys looking at you right now.
  Ill have what shes having!
  Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
 You know what, I think we can all agree that Angelas not so great, so..
 No. No. No.
 Stop talking.
 Oh God.
 Andy, shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? Thats like.. thats like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
 You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I cant and wont keep a secret.
 Erin?
 No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
 Oh. Yep. Im sorry about that. I feel... Im sorry I caused that thing.
 Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldnt worry about Angela. She doesnt hold a candle to you, Erin. Shes old enough to be your mom for one thing. And shes, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I dont think shes ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
 You said butt.
 Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him "Hey! Hey Scott!"
  Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster.
 Buenos dias, Erin.
 No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
 I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
 Buenos dias, Jaime.
 Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
 La telefona.
  Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
 Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.
 Yo soy Cancun.
 Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
 I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
 Did somebody order a hooker over here?
 Hi. How are you?
 Theres this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexters and, right now, were in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
 Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
  Hi.
 Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victorias Secret?
 Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
 Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
 Okay, I have more of them.
 I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
 And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
| Its subtle. Thats how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesnt know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that shes turned on.|
 This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. Ive never taken anybody there before.
 Ryan.
 And thats it. Thats me. Thats who I am.
 Oh, thanks.  Youre not bad, either.
 Hmm.
 Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
  You didnt see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
 Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
 Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
 So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
 Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
 I think we could.
 Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
 Why dont you run them again?
 If she is, its working.
 So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
 Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
 I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
 Theyre good
 Sure.
 I cant stop myself from kissing her.
 Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me its not totally insane to try one more time.
 Okay. What do you think?
 Andy?
 Okay, some for, some against.
 Pam?
 Im going with Pams group.
 Here we go.
 Okay.
 No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
 What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but thats not... the point.
 We should have your contract done by Thursday.
 Okay.
 Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
 I dont know. I think so.
  Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
 Thank you so much.
 Mmm.
  Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if theres any other questions that you have...
 All right. All right. Bye.
 And have a good elevator ride.
 Oh, whats that out there?
 I dont know. I dont know. Cant really trust my feelings anymore.
 She suckered you too.
 Was it the cleavage?
 Yep.
 God. She left this here?
 Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
 Yeah. This could be a signal. People dont just take barrettes off.
  Well...
 Yeah, I know. I know.
 I know. Youre right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
||
 Oh. Youre still here. I have your baguette.
 You know what? Everybody told me that you werent interested. Everybody. And I didnt believe em. And they were right. So... theres your barrette.
 Who?
 About what?
 No, no. No.
 No...
  What happened?
 Really?! Oh, thats great. Thats such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed.
 No, Im serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
 You know what? It doesnt matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!
 Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
 Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
 Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! Theyre going great. I, uh... were just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. Im actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
 Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
 Okay.
 Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
 Yeah, well, Stanley doesnt help with anything. Come on. Shout em out, shout em out.
 Oh!
 Thats fun.
 All right.
 We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Changs.
 Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
 You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldnt see.
 You guys think Donnas cheating on me?
 ... and... we had sex, too.
 How?
 How do I not make any more of it?
 All right.   And she wont say, "I love you."
 Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
 Yeah, she does all that.
 No, no...
 Run what?
 Why didnt you just say that, Pam?
 Well, thats easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. Its stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
 Yes, Jim, I do. And I cant stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
 Thats what makes it so wrong.
 Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, thats whats killing me.
  I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
 This is you. How much do you charge?
 Ill give you $50. Moneys no object.
 Okay.
 Its never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didnt have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
 Its comfort food, all right?  God.
 I know. Well, I hope youre right. Well see what Dwight says.
 Because I have him investigating her. Im waiting for a text update.
 Its too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
 God, this is so disgusting.
 I know.
 Thats not true.  Youre right, I ruin everything. And Ive known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
 Helene?
 Oh.
 Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
  All right.
 Youre back. What happened?
 No, what happened with Donna?
 Ugh!
 No. No! Are you sure?
 Who eats eight protein bars?
 Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
 What? No, she didnt say that.
 I am not paying for that membership.
  Ohhh... mmm...
 No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
 Thats her?
 Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, Ill talk to you later.
 I didnt. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
 Ye... pfff. Well, no. Its a lie. Thats not what happened. I just like you. I cant believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
 If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
 Well, you are boner-ific.
 ...poop my pants.
 Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
 We are?
 Wow.  Thats exciting.
 Hey.
 Well it can wait. It can wait.
 Jim is her husband.
 And they are having problems, so sh...
 Good in bed.
 Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
 Okay, weirdo.
 Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
 Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
 God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
 Im gonna kill him. No, Im not. I feel... I... no, Im not going to kill him.
 I have to hear it from her.
 I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
 I need to have her say...
 I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
 No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
  Okay. Okay. Okay.
 You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
 Wouldnt that be fun?
 How about Thursday?
 I cant do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
 Oh, really? cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. Itd be a great, great concert.
 Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
 Nope, thats Tuesday.
 Youre cheating. Youre cheating on me.
 Pam told me.
 Who is he?
 The other man. Whos the guy? Who is it?
 Im the mistress?
  Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured Id rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.
  Pfffffttt.
  Youre kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
  You know what? Were not gonna die of radon, were gonna die of boredom.
  Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
  Okay, alright.
  I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
  Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
  I dont know.
  Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
   Toby, just do it! God!
  Good work.
   Morning everyone.
  Hello!
  Oh, thank you. Its reversible, I think.
  Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles flavors? Cake it to the Limit. Thats my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
  Okay. Well... thats random. I will dig into those later.
  No, I gotta go. Text me later.
  Hey.
  Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
  That... exists?
  Okay, well, Ill have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
  Okay, Pam... shes not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
  Since when is this an office where we delve into each others personal lives?
  I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, its wrong.
  Well, I think we all know what youre capable of Meredith.
  People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
  I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
  He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
  Im sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
  On her diet! Hes a sports guy. Hes scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
  Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
  You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
  Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
  Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think hes an angel? I dont think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
  I am Beyonce always.
  Yes, I am.
  I would love that.
  I have work to do.
  Lets go.  I cant wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what hes making me do to her.
  All right, Andy, please.
  Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. Thats him. Thats him.
  Right there. The coach!
  Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
  All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
  You have no idea what youre talking about.
  You dont. No, no.
  You dont know. You dont-- you dont know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didnt even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet its like, "Hey, Donna, why dont you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why dont you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. Im taking all the credit."
  Okay, well, thats because hes paying their salary.
  I know, I know, I know. It--Im--it-- that was a euphemism.
  Shh! Okay, all right. Dont, dont.
   Okay.
  No. God. You go talk to him.
  No, no, no.
  Im good. Oh, my God.
  Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
  Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My hearts still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "Im sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin Bond.
  Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
  Dont thank me. Thank Dylans mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
  You love it. There ya go.
  Uh, no, they didnt say team. They just said coal Hawks.
  Well, then it wouldnt be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
  I did.
  No. We just talked. Hes very nice.
  It did not.
  Isnt it?
  Im awful, arent I?
  Im an awful guy! Ooh!
  I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when Im hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
  I dont care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. Thats Lemon.
  Youll learn, baby. Youll learn.
  Yeah, I noticed that.
  Nope.
  I have got big balls.
  Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, thats...  All right, all right. You know what? Im sick of this. Im sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think thats going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
  Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that were into isnt very condo-appropriate.
  Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
  Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
   How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And Im a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do whats right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
  Yes?
   Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
  Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? Whats going on?
  There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
 OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
 Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. Im like, what? All right. So I do it. Its on TV last night. And its in the paper today. And its online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. Its like, come on, people, enough.
 Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
 Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
 Yes.
 Yes. Come on! Get it up! Thats what... lets do it!
 Please.
 Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. Its not even that interesting a baby otter, it cant even stand up.  Its trying to stand up...  there it goes.
 Jo! We were not expecting you!
 Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
 Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
 There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
 Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
 Okay.
 We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
 Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
 I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. Id prefer it if they died, cause its not right.
 Okay.
 Ridiculous, Angela. And like Im going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
 Is there something that you would like to say to me?
 About talking to the press?
 Mmhmm.
 I dont believe you.
 Thats a little much. All right, all right, all right.
 Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
 Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
 Oh, no, no, no...
 Oh my god. Was she cute?
 Oh, god, Darryl!
 I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now hes probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I dont know what is.
 You leaked it?
 I dont know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
 Oh.
 Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
 So see you in Merediths van in five minutes.
 No, you know whats messed up? This situation all up in here is whats messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
 What do we got?
 Its okay, shes cool, she also whistle-blew.
 Hey, hey, its as interesting as a morgue.
 Okay, heres what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
 No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
 Just dont say no.
 Thats just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, lets just...
 Okay. You can count on me.
 Hey Jo.
 I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make em come to work, and we work em, and we make em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay em but we make em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, its Christmas, but right after theyre back in the thick of it.
 What?
 It doesnt matter what I know.
 Why?
 Well, deal with this.
 What?
 Are you going to kill me?
  Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
 I have rights.
 I am not going to tell you anything.
 Well, Im going through a little bit of a rough patch.
 Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
 And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
 Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. Its not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
 Hmm, hmm.
 You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
 I, I surely do, and dont call me honey.  You were playing too.
  We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
 That was fun.
 Thanks. Today helped.
 Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
