 Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. Its soy.  This is why I do it, thats what I have to come home to.  She probably wont be up for a few hours.
 This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin the sales team. I feel very blessed.
 Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
 It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
 Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
 Yeah.
 Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
 Yeah, its only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
 It was an accident.
 No.
 My lord my liege.
 So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
 So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
 Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
 No, I was being negligent. But shes in the hospital, shes fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
 Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
 Oh, right, Im sorry. What is we are fine?
 Ok, I have an announcement.
 No.
 No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look Im just trying to take everybodys mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
 So, like a freedom tree.
 Pam.
 Pam.
 Ok, good good, so well just all go down there together at lunch.
 Excellent!
 Good work Pam.
 Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
 Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
 Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I dont know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally Ill hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, dont sue me. That is the opposite of the point that Im trying to make.
 Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
 No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
 No... Shes in a coma.
 OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
 Yeah.
 Brought you some balloons. Why dont we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For Gods sake!
 Nurse.
  I am going to be sick... Im gonna puke.
 Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
 Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
 Well, just shhhh... just just...
 Look, I just... I dont understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
 Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
 Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But its not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
 OK, you know what? Everybody, lets just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so lets just...
 Sprinkles?
  Oh, sh... Im sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, thats 3 things. Ill tell you whats going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
 Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. Im not superstitious, but... Im... I am a little-stitious.
 Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
 Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
 Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
 Dwight, you havent seen Meredith yet, have you?
 Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
 Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
 Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
 Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright lets just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
 OK.
 Alright.
 Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
 Are you sure?
 What are you?
 OK, 1 Sikh, and...
 You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And its not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesnt make any sense... God is dead.
 Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe theres some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
 Oh God, Rabies?
 I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
 This place is so cursed.
  I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Merediths life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
 Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
 Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus dad?
 Pro-Am.
 A woman shouldnt have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why Im hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
 Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
 Come on man, gotta step it up! Its for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
 That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, hows the rabies quilt coming?
 Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
 Yes.
 OK.
 Alright, alright.
 Shhh...
 I know that youre probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
 OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
 Well, youre going to have to run, or youre going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
 We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
 Hmm... Thats a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
 Yep.
 You didnt contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And hows that been going?
 What about a rabies nurse?
 Thats possible. Look into that.
 Have you met that kid? Hes not going to college.
 Come in.
 Hey, hey, hey
 What are you doing?
 No I didnt, just please dont...
 May I enter the room?
 See how I did that. Thats the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
 Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
 European offices are naked all the time.
 Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
 Thats not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam youre an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I dont want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, its not fair to people with rabies. And thats the point, right? OK, lets go have some fun.
 Check that out.  Look at me, Im Toby, Im stretching, I know what Im doing. Why is he even here?
 OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And Id like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
 No, dont give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
 Hes happy because hes insane. You know what, thats the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Wheres the nurse?  This is the reason were here.
 Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
 Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
 You got it?
 OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
 Just remember folks, its not about winning, it is about finishing.
  Beow!
 On your left!
 I am fast! Im very fast! Im like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
 No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
 Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
 That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
  Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
  Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. Im getting a stitch.
  Take bat bites seriously. Dont get bit.
  I am not going to finish. I cant beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.
 I cant finish. I feel so weak, I just...
 What do you want me to do Jim?
 No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. Theyre deformed, and theyre abnormal, and... theyre illiterate and ugly. Symphonies dont have any money. Public TV is bust. I cant do anything about it, I cant... you know. Theres just one of me, and theres a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
 Thats a good deal.
 Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
 You just dont think I am capable, of making a difference.
 You dont, you dont know me. Youve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, Im the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!
 Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. Thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And Im very, very proud of that.
 Hey Mer. How ya doing?
 Its ironic isnt it? I mean Im in the hospital for not getting enough water, and youre in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
 Thanks, Im not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?
 Im not really sick.  Nah, Im good.
 Hey Toby. Whats this?
  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
 Oh really.
 Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think. I dont think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I dont think its any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
  No way.
 Woooah! Wow!
 Awesome!
 You guys! Yes! Yes!
 Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
 I love you guys, so much.
 No, no, no Pam let em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
 Hey. Can you make that straighter? Thats what she said.
 No.
 Blowing up balloons I thought.
 Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
 Hey!
 There he is! There he is! Hes back! And hes with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. Im Tubs.
 Ohh, yeah, lets get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
 ...business meeting --
 Thats right! Thats right!
 Fire guy. Dont start any fires, Ryan.
 Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. Youre like our little man...
 Beard.
 Oh, wow!
 Thats a little kinky. I dont swing that way.
 Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
 Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Lets get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
 Sounds good. OK, alright.
 Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, were friends. Im doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And well always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
 OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
 Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.
 Who is?
 I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
 Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
 Yeah, I know I understand... were making great strides and were updating, but business as usual, no?
 Good, so, were on the same page?
 We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And thats who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
 Hey.
  Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
 I dont want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
 Oh, I dunno, theyre launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. Hes being a real twerp about it, so, its all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
 Well...
 What is that... word?
 So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
 Good, were all here, we can get started.
 Have a seat.
 Have a seat. Like everybody else.
 Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
 Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
 No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "wheres the Beef?"   Yeah.
 I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Whos this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
 Sure thing.  Scuse me.
 Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
 Bob, how old are you?
 Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
 Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
 Wow.
 Oh, boy.
 Great.
 Great.
 Thats great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
 Perfect.
 Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks, because its illegal, and you will go to jail.
 No, No. Dont help him. He doesnt need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
 Good night guys.
 I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
 I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
 Smell that. Do you smell that?
 No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
 Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. Ill explain, later.
 Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IMs, but I think hes forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
 Hey boss, I didnt know you were coming in today.
 I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
 With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? Thats what people like.
 Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I cant do things. "You cant be on the team", "You cant move on to second grade". Well, now theyre telling me that I cant win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  Well see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
 OK. Were gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
 Why dont we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
 Yes?
 OK, thats not helpful Phyllis.
 Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
 Fine, Im just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
 No, this is my quest.
 Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
 We dont need luck.
 But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
 Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
 It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
 I know. So whos next?
 Who?
  Wow, those things are heavy! Theres a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
 Yes we do.
 Well...
 Mmhmm.
 OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
 Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
 Alright.
  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
 That is true.
 Yes, she is nuts.
 How do they know? How does this know where to turn? Thats very impressive.
 And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
 Ah, well its still very good. I bet I know someone who hasnt heard that joke... your daughter Emily. Hows she doing?
 Shes gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I dont want to take any more of your time, I know youre a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
 OK, OK! So youll reconsider?
 Ah... .is that all you have to say?
 Look, we want you back.
 Well, no.
 No its not.
 Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because youre definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
 Look... were also coming out with a website soon. Its a state of the art thing, itll be up and running, its gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
 Great, the magic of the gift basket.
 OK, good. Dont let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, shes alergic.
 I dont get it, I really dont get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
 That is a very good point, Dwight.
 No, it said right, it said take a right.
 Maybe its a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
 The machine knows where it is going!
 The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
 Let go, let go of me!
  You sure youre OK?
 Good, that is whats most important.
 What a disaster, this whole thing.
 These people just dont realize what a gift basket means, they dont get it.
 What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I dont even know if I want it. Theyre website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
 Hang up.  You know what were gonna do? Were walking back. Were walking back to that office and were gonna reclaim our gift basket!
 Were gonna take whats rightfully ours! Were gonna take a stand, Dwight! Were gonna take a stand!
 Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
 Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, lets leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
 Look, my clothes are so wet!
 Its been opened.
 Whats missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
 WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
 May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
 Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
 I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology, and look where it got me.
 Exactly!
 Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
 Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
 Hey Toby. Whats this?
  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
 Oh really.
 Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think.

 Yes?
 OK, thats not helpful Phyllis.
 Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
 Fine, Im just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
 No, this is my quest.
 Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
 We dont need luck.
 But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
 Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
 It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
 I know. So whos next?
 Who?
  Wow, those things are heavy! Theres a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
 Yes we do.
 Well...
 Mmhmm.
 OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
 Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
 Alright.
  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
 That is true.
 Yes, she is nuts.
 How do they know? How does this know where to turn? Thats very impressive.
 And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
 Ah, well its still very good. I bet I know someone who hasnt heard that joke... your daughter Emily. Hows she doing?
 Shes gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I dont want to take any more of your time, I know youre a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
 OK, OK! So youll reconsider?
 Ah... .is that all you have to say?
 Look, we want you back.
 Well, no.
 No its not.
 Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because youre definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
 Look... were also coming out with a website soon. Its a state of the art thing, itll be up and running, its gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
 Great, the magic of the gift basket.
 OK, good. Dont let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, shes alergic.
 I dont get it, I really dont get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
 That is a very good point, Dwight.
 No, it said right, it said take a right.
 Maybe its a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
 The machine knows where it is going!
 The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
 Let go, let go of me!
  You sure youre OK?
 Good, that is whats most important.
 What a disaster, this whole thing.
 These people just dont realize what a gift basket means, they dont get it.
 What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I dont even know if I want it. Theyre website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
 Hang up.  You know what were gonna do? Were walking back. Were walking back to that office and were gonna reclaim our gift basket!
 Were gonna take whats rightfully ours! Were gonna take a stand, Dwight! Were gonna take a stand!
 Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
 Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, lets leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
 Look, my clothes are so wet!
 Its been opened.
 Whats missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
 WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
 May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
 Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
 I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology, and look where it got me.
 Exactly!
 Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
 Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
 And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  Theyre just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesnt have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
  We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
  Yeah!  I know.  I know.  Its bland.
 Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
 Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a "Wheres Waldo."
  Alright. Alright.  Lets quit while were ahead.
  That was awesome. Thank you.
  Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
  Oh, does he?
  Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
  And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
  Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York Citys finest, and I do not mean policemen...
  The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 600 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
  No.  It doesnt.  Ill find out tonight.
  Whats that, pipsqueak?
 Ohh, lunch party.
 Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
  Okay.
  Really?
 Its the European cut.
  Umm... hey.  Ah, whats hanging?
  Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
  I had um, one of those danishes.
  Why dont you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  Itll be fun.
  Just...
  Yeah.
  Thank you.
  Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think Im a big loser.
  Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
  Im sorry. Im sorry.  Its just the first... girl that popped into my head.  Ill find somebody I havent slept with.
  So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
  Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
  Just let me know who the winner is.
  Alright.  Im ready to go and Im callin shotgun.
  Yes.  Thank you.
  Oh yeah, youd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I love ya Pam... okay.    Im leavin inside Jims car, I dont know when Ill be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow Ill be back.  Ill be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why dont you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
  If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
  You ever read this?
  Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places Youll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
  Same sort of stuff in here.
  Mmwa.  Mmwa.
  Leaving Pennsylvania.
  One for me one for Jan.
  You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  Thatd be fun.  Friday?
  Wanna come over Friday?
  After work you guys...
  Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  Its a club called Chatroom, and theres a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
  What are you doing?
  No.
  No, Im sure thats not.  Na...
  Yes.
  Well the invitation says VIPs only.  Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?  Were already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay Im going to throw up.  Im throwing up.  Youre making me throw up, Ryan.
  You know what this is like?  Ill tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldnt let any of the Seniors go.
  Doesnt it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
  Yeah.  I withdrew too.
  Alright who wants to party?
  Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
  I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
  Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party youve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybodys gonna come.  Whats wrong with Dwight?
  Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela Id like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
  This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasnt as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, Im not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
  How we doing on time?
  Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
  Mmmhmm.
  Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
  I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
  Yes
  Uh...
  I want it...
  I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
  Yes you can.
  Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldnt say that if I didnt hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
  No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we dont have a lot of time.  Ill get the pizza!
 Good news.
 Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
 Same thing.
 You know what?  I dont understand when you all talk at the same time.
 Pizza by Alfredo.
 Okay, okay, whats better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
||
 Yup.
 You dont have to say it like that.
 Hey
 Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
 Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
 You didnt actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
 Okay, it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon, and if its policy, it should say it on the coupon.
  What do you mean hmm-um?
 It is your problem.  Thats no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
 Im not giving that to you.
  No, no youre not going anywhere.  Youre staying here until we figure this out.
 You know what?  This young man needs to learn thats not how you treat people.  I dont care if its pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You dont just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
 Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
 No, you dont even know what stupid is.  Its about to get all stupid up in here.
 You ready to give me my discount now?
 Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
 Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
 No!  Im an adult, I dont have to think or do anything.  Youre a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks hes better than everyone else, because hes some hot shot, and you dont know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
 Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked thats called sales.
 Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
 Stop talking all at once!
 Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
 You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
 Im not kidnapping him, Im keeping him until I get what I want.
 I think youre over-thinking it.
 Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that Im keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
 Trouble.  Okay, alright.
 He said no.
 No, no.
 Mister Overdramatic, whats up Kevin?
 Ill just wave and introduce myself.
 Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
 Hey, have you seen Jim?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
 Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
 I could have paid for the pizza.
 Oh my God, oh my God.
 This is Michael.
 Youre breaking up. I cant hear you.
  Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
 I will open the door.
 And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
 Yes.
 See ya, drive safely.
  Okay.
 Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
 Not now Dwight, please, its not the time.
 What a horrible day.
 Bluh.
 Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  Id really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
 Im going to get it.
 Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
 New York.  Wanna go?
 Alright, you drive.
 Here we go.
 Mmm.
 Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, lets go.
 Guilty.
 Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
 Yeah.
  Im Ryan, and tonight didnt go the way that I thought it would, because it didnt work out for me, and Im very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
 I never sold any paper, because Im an idiot.
 I made it with my cheese pita.
 I started a fire, I started a fire.
 And Im hot, Im so hot. Thats why everybody...
 Well, its part of it, its just the... uhhh.
 Wanna head back?
 Coat!
 Steak! Wheres my steeaaak?
 Get me Armani.
 On the phone.
 Wheres Armani? Hes on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. Im so much better than you are.
 I owe you an apology.
 Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Wont ruin it for you.
 Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want whats best for you, Mo Chuisle.
 I havent heard the same about you. So lets just go with mine.
 We already have a sofa. So why do---
 It... folds up. Youve only seen it flat.
 I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
 Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when Im sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. Im going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
 Its just that you say its gonna cost what it costs---
 Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
 Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
 Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
  Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
 Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
 Use to have two cars, traded em in, now were down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
 You can not, I have a thing tonight.
 What?
 Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
 How about this weekend?
 Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
 You wouldnt understand. Its a secret.
 Im sorry Mr. OBrian, I didnt mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it wont be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.
 I just love sales. I love it to death. Its as simple as that. And I dont get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
 Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
 No, theyre with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
 These meetings are useless.
 Very inspirational.
 Or a trained seal.
 Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
 Im just calling because you responded positively to the---
  ...Stanley?
  Senor, are you happy with your---
  Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
 Well your son sounds like hes really motivated. I think its crazy the coach wont play him frankly.
 You bet.
 Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
 It is not a waste of our time.
 Vikram doesnt have my people skills.
 Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
 What did you get tonight?
 Oh, that looks good.
 I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
 Thank you.
 Really?
 Wonder what I wouldve been back home?
 I know, but its competitive here. Whats a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
 I wouldve been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
 You know what, heres the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, hes just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But hes an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? Hes invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. Its not Terminator.
 I actually wrote a movie.
 Im writing one, yeah.
 Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
 Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
 Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin?
 Okay. Hows yoga?
 Wh-Why not?
 Okay.
 Good night Vikram.
 Hey, congrats on the bonus.
 Im gonna have it one of these nights.
 Good night.
 Um... that wasnt much of an introduction.
 Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today were gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
 Yes I forgot about Ryans presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
 And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, thats what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
 Why?
 No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
 My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
 What I do between 530 pm and 1 am is no ones business but mine and my other business.
 It wont.
 Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
 Why dont you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
 Huh, okay.
 Its whoever, not whomever.
 No, whomever is never actually right.
 Not a native speaker.
 Well it sounds right, but is it?
 Thank you.
 No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomevers name is Toby, why dont you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
 Ive never done this before. Ive never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
 Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
 And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
 In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I cant do this.
 I am.
 I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
 Hey Kevin, youre a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
 Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I dont know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like hes tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
 Do you know anybody in the mob?
 Okay, um, Oscar, Im going to need to take another advance on my salary.
 Hey guys.
 Whatcha talking about?    Okay, I know whats going on.  Youre talking about Jim and Pam, if theyre having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
 Hey, hey, hey.
 Monkey problem? No, Im not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
 Oh, I hate monkeys.
 I dont have a second job.  Maybe Im having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
 I dont talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
 I totally agree with you.  But I dont have money problems, I dont.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?
 Yeah, but I destroyed it, its not even useable anymore.
 No you didnt.
 How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
 That is a good point.
 Like the witness protection program.
 Ive always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  Ive already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  Im a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  Thats the life.
 I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
 I didnt say it, I declared it.
 Yeah, tell me about it.
 You know, Jan has my credit cards, and shes using them as if Im made of money, she thinks Im a human ATM machine.
 Oh, thats the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
 That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think thats how they got a core.
 Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
 Right.
 How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
 No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
 We will find another way, well ask power-point.
 Youre a presentation tool if you think Im gonna tell Jan about this.
 No youre not! Ok, just... youre not a tool. Look, well tell her that its bad, but it couldve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
 She poses.
 Um, thats, how did you get that from what Oscars saying?
 What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. Im getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
  Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and Im never coming back.
 Hey Jan.
 Not much, whats up with you?
 Im out of answers Jan.
 I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
 I dont know that.
 Ill stay off the grid.
 Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
 Thats really nice of you to say.
 I think the engineer left.
 Dont sell your implants please.
 Thats nice though.
 It looks cute though.
 Yeah! Everything! Oh its all good, its all good. Phyllis!
 Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
 We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... its uh, not too shabby.
 Okay, its football cream. Its football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
 Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
 Hello hello!
 Michael Scott.
 Regional manager.
 Excited to talk ideas.
 You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
 All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
 I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The Nard Dog. Who let the Nard Dog out?
 He gives the best back rubs in the office.
 Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
 Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
 These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
 Who else?
  Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that shes in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the worlds largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the worlds largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
 Actually I dont get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
 Yeah, I know.
 Mmm. Okay.
 Thats what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.
 Well we can do better than that.
 The waving?
  Shrek! Shrek, Im a donkey! Im a donkey, Shrek!  Im just kidding. Its me. Hello Ry.
 Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
 Yeah, well when I call about big problems you dont like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
 Im creative, Ryan.
 Well actually I cant cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mikes Cereal Shack. Im thinking well have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
 Yeah!
 Are you? I dont think youre doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
 All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldnt even talk yet.
 Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
  How about never hundred hours, sir.
 Hey thanks. Thank you.
 Yeah, Im glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
 Whats up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that its ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and well do it on my dime.
 Im willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
 Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
 Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "Youre not creative"?
 Well theyre wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
 We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So lets get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, Id like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
 Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
 Line it up Phyllis.
 Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
 Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. Ill make you a mix.
 Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
 No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I dont hate it, I just dont like it at all. And its terrible.
 Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
 No. I said I hate the, the style.
 Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
 Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we dont get this, if we dont nail it, were going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
 Thata girl.
 Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
 Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
 Im about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. Theyll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
 Pam, please clear my phone lines.
 They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.
  Well, its been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
 No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. Its not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
 That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
 This is perfect.
 This is a dummy, a la Ferris Buellers Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
 But, you will not tell anyone.
 Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.    Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  Were going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
 Just go out, and come back in.
 What?
 Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
 No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
 Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
 That could not possibly be it.
 You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I dont know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
 How can I get you to stay?
 Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why youre really leaving.
 Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
 Pssh, kay.
 Fillipellers, hows it hanging?
 To the left?
  To the right?
 Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
 Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
 No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but Im going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
 You can train him.  Hes very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I cant do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, Im going to poach one of yours.
 Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?
 Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
 Im going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because Im a genie in a bottle, and Im going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
  Get out.  Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess thats not as grabby.
 No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
 What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  Were like Animal House.
 Jim, were getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
 What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, thats what were going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
 Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and were going to crush this sale.  Were going to prove, what the hell is that music?
  Thats the problem, thats the problem.  We need rock n roll Pam, rock n roll.  Alright?  Oh... My... God, thats why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
 What? What? We did?
 Look at his face! Look at his face!
 What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
 We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what were doing.
 Uh-huh.
 Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
 We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
 In your face
 Are you calling Karen?
 Yep, get it.
 It had to be done, it had to be done.
 Hey Dwight, he found it.
 Alright, youre going to miss the best prank ever.
 Do you really wanna know?
 Follow me, come here.  Heres what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
 No, no, not real bombs.
 Uh, maybe, maybe, I dont know.
 It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
 Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
 So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
 I cant imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
 ...awesome.
 Okay, I will start.  Um, "A."  "A" my name is Alan, and my wifes name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
 Im trying to think of what we could sell.
 Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
 What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
 Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
 Ill kill you man!
 That is just so disgusting!
 Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
 Yeah, Dwight, heres how its going to go down.  You and I-
 You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
  We are in a stairwell.
 Theres a guy, theres a guy.
  Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
 We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
 Its enormous, but its got wheels.  Were wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
 Aha!
 Were wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
 Save yourself!
 Dwight, you gotta move!
 Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
 Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
 Just say you wanna get back together.
 It doesnt have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
  Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanleys head, we will burn Utica to the ground.
 We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, Im gonna need some help writing a want ad.
 Um, wanted middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart.  I cant do this.
 Of course.
 Really?
 Morning.
  Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
 Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real.
 So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
 Really?
 Oh, you wanna go today?
 How often can you actually donate blood?
 Your body only has a certain amount.
 Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
 A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making smores?
 Hello, Im Broken Mountain. You know, heres the thing. Thats not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
 In the wilderness. Its not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. Its one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
 I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
 Im sick of it Jim. Im sick of this place.
 When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
 OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
 OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what...
 Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
 Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
 No.
 Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
 Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
 Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
 This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
 When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
 This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
 Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
 Well...
 You...
 You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
 I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I cant retrace my steps. I dont know what streets weve been---  Ow! What are you doing?
 No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
 Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
  Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday!
 Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
 What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
 Stop.
 Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
 Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.
 Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.
  Day One. Im in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. Ive brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. Its hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 oclock in the afternoon. Its really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I dont hit my corroded artery here...
 There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
 Im going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
 See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things.
 Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
 I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. Im loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesnt even matter.
 Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
 I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldnt come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. Im startin to feel it a little bit. Ohh... Its Creeds birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
 Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. Ive made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
 Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are natures best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
 Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, dont do that. Youre gonna break something.
 Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didnt want to have to struggle to survive. I dont need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I dont need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I dont need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky.
 Hey, buddy.
 What up?
 You are relieved.
 So what did I miss?
 Oh.
 Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
 Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, youll figure it out.
 Thats what I said. Thats what she said.
 I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
 Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
 Ill call back.
  Yeah, um, tell him Ill call him back.
 You cant always work 200 days though.
  Oh, no, no, no, I dont have time for this. Tell him Im in a meeting.
 Yep.
 Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
 N-No, money isnt everything Ryan. And youre my friend, and I dont want to be rude.
 I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
 Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.
 Yeah, I hate that.
 So, heres the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jans wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
 Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. Thats how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? Im feeling a little queasy.
 Well-
 Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
 Yep. Tell them how much youre gonna get if you win.
 Million dollars!
 Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jans answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like its not memorized.
 Perfect crime.
 Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
 Im getting car sick! Ugh, Im gonna puke. I think Im gonna throw up.
 Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
 Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
 Hey hey.
 I would love that.
 Abso-fruitley. Yeah. Ill-Ill do anything for the company.
 It is.
 Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
 Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
 Never. I want him gone. I dont talk until he leaves.
 Okay. All right.
 Yessh.
 Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
 I havent actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
 Six years and two months.
 Thats what she said.
 Thats what she said.
 Uh, wh-why would she say that?
 Come again? Thats what she said? I dont know what youre talking about.
 Well, delivery is all wrong. Shes butchering it.
 She thought it had to do with the twins. Thats what I call them.
 Um, to be delicate, they hang off miladys chest. They... make milk.
 Yes.
 Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
 Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
 Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
 I will allow it.
 Uh...
 Uh-huh.
 Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, thats like six years ago. If its from the first time we kissed, thats like two years ago.
 If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
 Line.
 Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
 Irie.
 I dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
  Can I sit here?
 How can you give up my diary like that?
 Howd you even find it?
 I dont like lump. Im really upset about this.
 Fine. I love you.
 Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
 Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
 Thank you very much. You didnt have to say that.
 That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
 March 17th.
 Yes.
  "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
||
 How can you do that to me?
 Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
 See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
 ...Absolutely not.
 Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
  Hey, David?
 I think youre a nice guy too.
 Why did I do it? I dont know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
  What do you want to do for dinner?
 Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
 Do you fast food?
 Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
 Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, Im - God, Im so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we dont want to work. No we dont! Its not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! Were not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
 All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
 I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
 You said you didnt have plans. Thats what you said.
 Dwight, its couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
 Hello.
 Come on in. Good to see you.
 Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
 Yeah.
 Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
 Except driving.
 Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I dont know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
 Okay.
 Totally your call babe.
 Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
 Well, thats...
 Yep, never been used.
 No.
 This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
 As you can smell theres a lot of different odors going on in here.
 Bond.
 James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
 Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
 Well, I-
 Thanks, thats my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
 Its actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
 I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.
 Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
 No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
 If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
 Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
 Ill get it.
 Okay.
 Very nice.
 When in Rome.
 Whatever you say babe.
 All right.
 How bout a toast. Shall I? Heres to good friends.
 Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
 Yeah that sounds good.
 You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
 All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
 Yes, I was watching Jims face.
 And he was laughing.
 Look at him, hes laughing.
 Well you dont need two of you to do that.
 Thats true, thats a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
 All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
 All right, Okay, okay, youre getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
 No, Baah! But hes married to her!
 No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, Im gonna pass, Im gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
 Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
 No!
 God, does anybody read the paper?!
 Youre welcome.
 I dont like that story babe.
 Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, dont. I shouldnt say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
 Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! Im in hell! Aaahhh Im burning, help me!
  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jans candles.
 Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
 Im sorry.  What now?
 Dwight is my friend.
 You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didnt have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
 Whatever I want? Its never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
 When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasnt so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didnt want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
 Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
  Pam... I hope she didnt do anything to the food.
 I cant prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
 You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
 Excuse me for a second.
 Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
 Everybody enjoying their meal?
 Yeah?
 No. No. Im gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I dont think hes that good.
 BFD. Im a screenwriter.
 NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
 MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
 OH GOOD. ILL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
  THATS WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
 You know what guys, shell be out of the bathroom soon.
 Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
 Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
 Would she get into trouble?
 I will take the fall. I did it.
 Jim? Pam?
 No.
 Nope.
 Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
  Have you ever seen this woman?
 Hmm...
 Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. Shes got - I dont know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
 Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
 I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
 What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And Im optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
 Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.
 I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
  Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
 I thought that you were engaged?
 Whaaaat? God, thats terrible man. Eghh, shes crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
 Oh...
 Yeah... ugh. Shes...  you dont deserve her. Alright.
  Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know youd never touch em, because of your condition. Umm...
 What?
 Oh.
 Hmm, I see, feisty. So shes not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
 Oooo. Catcher or in field?
 Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
 I think Im being very clear what Im asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that youre not answering the question.
 Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
 What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and theyre just hanging me out to dry.
 Dating shouldnt be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
 Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I dont wanna hear "Ahnnn... I cant help elhh la la." No. No. Im a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what were going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
 Hmm..
 Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad.
 That would be bad.
 Wish I could, but I cant. Well can, but wont. Should, maybe, but shornt.
 What part of shornt dont you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
 Oh you cant because I dont care. Listen,  dont forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
 Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try.
 Hello Wendy, this is Kevins friend, Michael.
 Oh, Im sorry, could you put her on please?
  Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
 Well, Ill send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
 Well put it aside.   Umm... yeah.
 Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
 That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendys, get my food. Come back and then go.
 Shes dead?  Shes so young.
 Oh, God. Oh...
 Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
 Please, not at a time like this.
 Oh really? Whats her name? Burger King?
  I dont, I dont think Im ready. Is she hot?
 No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
  No, not the five families.
  Sorry, I dont have time for this right now. Im trying to get a date with Pams hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
  Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady.
  Ugh.
 Is who a Michael what?
 Oh, thats not, yeah Im not... OK...
 So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
 Just making conversation.
 Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... its uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
 You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that.
 Yeah. Yeah, and you cant see her whole body. Down here, shes got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I dont know.
 Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
 Now you ruined it.
 Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
 Oh, OK, Well Im looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. Im a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...
 I dont know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. Its just...
 Youre right. What do you mean though?
 Hmm.
  How did she die?
 God.
 She was so innocent.
 You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, thats just silly because shes dead. What do you do?
 Oh, you move on.
  Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh whyd you have to go off and die? Whyd you have to go off  and die?
 Return.
 Thisll be  the day that I died.
 I got gum in my hair.
 This just stinks. Dont touch it, please dont touch it.
 OK, let me be.
 I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanleys car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
 Kill me... right now.
 I dont feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
 Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair were talking about.
 Smells good.
 Oh dont. Thats disgusting.
 Well just dont leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, thats nice.
||
  I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women Im getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they arent nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
 Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
 Yeah.
  Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
 Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
 Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
 Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
 Na?
 Well you tried.
 Yeah.
 They sound great.
 Would you have sex with Meredith?
 Do you think shed keep it quiet?
 Jim, its not the horniness, ok its the loneliness that...
 Lets go to New York. Well go clubbing with Ryan.
 Yes you can, youre single, Im single. Itll be awesome.
 Who you dating?
 Thats still going on?
 Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, were going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
 Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Lets go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
 I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
 Thats... I, I think that...
 Ryans assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
 Place is packed.
 Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
 No, theyre just hotties.
 Hey.
 Hey!
 Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
 Alright!
 Yeah.
 Ryan, its Michael and Dwight.
 Ok.
 Well.
 Alright!
 Lets do it!
 Hey, nice to meet you.
 Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
 Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
 I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future."  "Back" because its on my back and "Future" because Im the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And its my second favorite movie.
 Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
 Forty... Im in my forties.
 Nuhh...
 Oh, OK.
 You are welcome.
 This place is like sexy pre-school.
 I would love a place where we could meet older
 Ahh, wow. Thats dangerous.
 Youre kidding.
 Ive never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
 I am a bank teller.
 Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
 I think so.
 Yeah, I have fun.
 All right.
 Very perfect.  Oh my  This needs to be shared.
 She washes dogs.
 I know. I dont wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Hmm...
  I am. I am getting out there. Well, no Ive asked a lot of girls to dance mom. Theyre just, its not...  Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
  Those girls really wailed on you bad.
 Well...
 Pretty weird.
 Lets go.
 I know, here we go.
 This is it.
 This is where the magic happens.
 Very nice.
 Dwight, Im the boss.
 Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I dont wannna get my head stepped on.
 Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
 Shh. Ryan, Ryan, were going to take your clothes off.
 Shh, just stop. Heres what you do. You tell him that youre his friend and that youre gonna help him and that everyones gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out whos selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people whos really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I dont understand a word of it.
 Best night ever.
 Like I said, its not about the horniness, its about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I dont, I disagree, I say... lets hear it for the boys.
 Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
 Wet cement, outside. Its drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
 M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I dont...
 Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
 Here we go!
 Lets, yes?
 Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Lets hear it!
 Its drying, its drying...
 Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
 Ahh come on!
 No!
 No!
 No!! Come on, gimme something good!
 Pam, translate.
 I love it!
 I love it more!
 I... love it!! Haha, come on!
  Hurry, please.
  Thats what she said.
 Today is a very special day for me. And its really not about me, its about my grandkids, its about my great grandkids... I can come back here when Im 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "Thats me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, its a good feeling.
 All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. Youre moving in the wrong direction...
 Ub, dub dah, dont need, I cant even hear you. Its just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, were going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
 Ener-gize...
 Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I havent done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
 Zing and pep, see thats those are the kind of words were looking for. Yes, Jim?
 Now were cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
 An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
 Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
 Stanley, were havin a little...
 Were havin a little brainstorm session...
 ...Good, this is good. Im going to grab a glass of water.
 Ugh, what?
 What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
 That? In the conference room?
 We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
 Well you dont get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and youre... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another "Hey um, youre poor." "Well hey, youre mamas dead." Thats what friends do. Its... youre so white.
 Mmhmm.
 Okay, I will... Im not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
 Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so its probably psychological.
 I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
 Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didnt mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole things silly, isnt it? Friends dont need to apologize to friends as far as Im concerned, so we are cool.
 Uh huh...
 Great
 Whats the pink?
 Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
 Other than me.
 I never said you could do that.
 I...
 Okay, I will think about it.
 No.
 Hey.
 Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
 Its an advice question, and if you dont wanna talk about it, I completely understand. Its, um...
 I know, its very, very personal...
 I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
 God.
 Okay.
 Okay, so dig this youre on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
 Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
 What is that?
 Really?
 I wouldve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
 Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
 Its like a mock execution.
 Yes it is a good idea. Its the only possible solution I have left.
 No, okay... Ive had enough of you.
 Because I want you to behave as if Im actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
 Im not firing him. Im not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what Im going to do, is Im going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? Im teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? Thats all Im, okay, here he comes. Lets just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
 Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
 I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
 Hmm.
 Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
 Thats it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
 Okay...
 Yes.
 Thats not-
 All right, all right...
 Okay.
 Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
 Everybody, except Stanley.
  I dont understand why you keep picking on me.
 You just, do, and I dont know why, so... please help me understand.
 Well Stanley, maybe youre feeling that you dont respect me because you dont know me very well.
 All right, you dont respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you cant talk to me that way in this office, you just cant. I am your boss. Cant allow it.
 I am good person, and sometimes, good people dont get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I dont get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I dont respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what dont get no respect? Airplane food. Why dont they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife dont get no respect, some--take her, please, for example.  If you dont get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  Whats the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I dont get no respect!
 So Im thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
 Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
 Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
 Yeah, Im pretty excited too.
 Today Im heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
 Yup.
 Why are you dressed like that?
 Like youre applying for a loan.
 Okay, heres what were going to do Im going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We dont have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely aint going to college.
 Lets go!
  A little over the top, dont you think?
 This is all we need.
 Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!   Hello!
 Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
 Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest."
 Hes totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.
 How you doing? Listen, I dont think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
 Oh, no problem.  And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
 Are you mental?
 I... dont.
 And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
  Hello there.
 Well its funny that you should ask, because its really more than a company...
 Dammit, Oscar!
 Yeah, Im trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
  What do you want?
 Who cares? Im not there, Jims not there, why should they have to be there?
 Thank you!  What, what is this?
 This isnt Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
 Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! Were dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
 Yes. And dont call me Shirley.
 All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
 Hey!  Game over.
  Just-in time.
 Just-in case. Whats your last name?
 This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
 Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and shes hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. Hes the most... important thing in my life right now.
 I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
 This is Darryl Philbin. Isnt he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
 Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
 So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didnt bring are even better. Justin, Im willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
 No, I didnt. You misconstrued me.
 I, uh, hmm.
 Why dont... hey.
 Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, Id like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I dont even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, thats not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, Im gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
 Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
  Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.
 Today is Toby Flendersons last day. I couldnt sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
 Mornin.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. Im going to set my watch alarm... And...
 First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Tobys going away party.
 Okay.
 Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
 If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
 Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
 Toga!
 I thought that you might say that.
 Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didnt know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
 I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
 Phyllis, can you do this?
  Tobys replacement. Ugh. Wow.
 Well, we know that Toby thinks shell be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
 Why do you hate her?
 You know, Dwight, sometimes... I dont know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
 Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
 We need to sell her an elevator pass.
 Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
  Yeah.
 Oh, hey, do you still work here?
 Nah.
 No. I think I will pass.
 Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Heres how things work here my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert Im gonna win.
 Yeah.
 T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
 Y-You can-Michael.
 Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe shes just an awesome woman from this planet.
 Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, wed have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
 I bet.
 I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
 Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
 You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
 All right.
 Yep.
  Hmm... Jim?  I am downloading some N3P...
 Music...
 For a CD mix tape...
 For Holly.
 And Im looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
 The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
 And "I... love you."
 Hey, whats the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
 I think I do.
 Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
 Well, youre not a romantic.
 Oh really?
 Like, with who?
 Pam?
 Yeah, you took it too slow.
 This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
 I dont want her to get away.
 Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You dont, uh, you dont have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. Thats how we buy them actually.
 And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
  Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um...
 So are you in down this weekend? Cause, Im not-Im not... Im not gonna be in town. Im going out of town.
 Kidding.  Acting!
  Acting!
 Yeah.
 I did it!
 I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
 It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
 Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base...
  Yeah...
 Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why dont you go home, and come back for the party?
 Yes we do.
 Ill let you in on a little secret Ive been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin for a bruisin for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin.
 Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
 Hey! Hi, good to see you.
 Im just having a little exit interview.
 Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why dont you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
 Okay.
 Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
 Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
 Sure. You know what? That sounds good. Ill take a little look-see.
 Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
 Well, no no no no no...
 No no no no no. Im not asking it. Im just reading it out loud.
  Ill kill you.
 Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I dont even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I dont know which is which...
 What the hell is that?
 Thats... What do you mean, "Michael"? Thats not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
 No!
 Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
 My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
 I am going to give Toby...
 ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
 How did you know?
 Well... Thats my watch.
 Hey, thats good.
  Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
  Im just worried about my friend.
 Just, Im fine. Im holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
 Im cool.
 Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. Im pretty sure shes baked on a professional level.
 No antigravity machine, huh?
 Ferris wheels pretty cool though.
 Thats what she... a lot of places are like that.
 Thanks.
 I like, uh...
 Hey. What are you doing?
 What the hell is going on here?!
 There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
 Why did you do that?
 No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?
 Shh...
 Im really sorry.
 Yeah...
 Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didnt believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I dont know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it!
  Alright! Lets hear it for Darryl and his band.  You know what? Lets also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
 Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
 I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
 Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
 I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
  It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin on.
  Goodbye Toby, its been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
  Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Tobys goin away! See ya! Hes outta here! See ya! Hes outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
 Oh, hey. Thanks.
 Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. Its uh, its uh, very sexual.  Sorry. Kevin.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
 Just pay for it and well reimburse you when you get back.
 What is it?
 Yeah. Hes at the supermarket and he needs me.
 Yeah, thats true. Dont move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then Ill-okay, Ill be back.
 O-kay. Hello Jan.
 Wow, Kevin, really? Were-  Sorry. Were in the middle of a party.  Is this why you called me down here?
 Oh, okay.
 Thanks, Kevin. Um...
 Wow. I cant believe it! Look at you!  Are you nauseous?
 Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
 Good. Good. Thank God.
 Cause thats...
 Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
 Because youre pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
 ... proud.
 Um...
 You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
 Well, okay...
 So its mine, and its not somebody elses, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
 You did?
 When we were going out?
 W-I dont understand. You always used to be very cautious... Id wear two condoms.
 Youd rather have somebody elses sperm than my sperm?
 IHop.
 Im glad you told me.
 Um, Ill... I have to think about it.
 My whole life, I have known two things I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
 Hey.
 Yeah?
 Oh, wow.
 Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh...
 Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
 Have a good night.
 Bye.
 Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
 Sorry. Corporate policy.
 You might take something.
 Okay, security guard.
 Okay.
  Hi, Jan, its Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if theres any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning.  I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
