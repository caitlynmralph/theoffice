 Me too.  ...I think were just drunk.
 No...  Jim---
  Chicken.
 Excellent, thanks.
 Yeah, I didnt go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I cant really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But Im, Im doing well.  I have my own apartment.  Im taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
 Michael, Dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer.
 Yeah?
 No, I didnt.
 What was Oprah about?
 Thats a really big decision.
 Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
 Or not adopt.
 Roys sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
 You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
 Yeah.
 You probably wont.
 No, Michael.
 No, Michael.
 Sure.
 This.
 Thank you.
 Yes, I have a date. Hes a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. Im kind of nervous. I havent been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldnt broadcast that.
 Ill probably just wear this.
 Um...
 Mm-hmm.
 Hey! Whats up?
  Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. Hes not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. Whats up?
 Okay. Well, if you think of it, Ill be here.
 So how do you come up with your cartoons?
 You dream in cartoons? How fun!
 Huh.
 Freedom fries. Yeah.
 Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
 More freedom fries.
 Thats great.
 I went on a date. It wasnt a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, Ill just kinda know.
  Popcorn anyone?
  Anyone else?  Nooo.
 Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, its been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
  Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.
 Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
  Ok.
 Really?  I dont know.
 Not at work, Ill try it on---
  ...noooo
  Its too much.
 Im gonna return it.
 Hi.
 Thanks.
 I have this little vacuum cleaner thats broken.  If Dwight doesnt work out, maybe that could be manager.
 What?
 Please go back to your desk.
  Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But Im gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, itll be cool to just have some after work clothes that arent pajamas.
 Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
 But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
  With cream and sugar?
 The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
 Is there anything I can do?
 Yeah.
 Oh.  Okay.
  Okay.
 Oh.  I would like a break.
 Great.
 I think so.  I dont know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
 You waited for me?
 Lets see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
 Is it for the bird?
 I have it covered.
 If you wanna do something for the funeral...
 Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
 Do you have it with you?
 Did I wake up this morning thinking Id be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
 Actually, I have it.
 Id also like to say a few words if thats okay.
 What do we know about this bird?  You might think, "Not much.  Its just a bird."  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe its that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
 And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I dont think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
 An impression, then.  Lastly, we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesnt mean he was alone.  Because Im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
  Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
 Hi.
 Oh, I dont know if Im...
 Its weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately its like hes five.
 Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. Its really not a big deal. To some people it is.
 Michael.
 Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
 Hey, why dont you just go up to your office, get some work done, and Ill just bring you a pretzel.
 You know, I just think its really important that you be productive today.
 Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. Hes, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
 Night.
 20 past 5.
 PM.
 These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
 This is a huge sale.
 Night, Michael.
  Dunder Mifflin.
 Oh my God.
 Hi.
 Oh.
 I had to work late. Jans making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
 Yeah, totally. So...
 Do you...
 Uh, no, I um. Everythings pretty much the same here.
 A little different. What time is it there?
 Oh, yeah. Right.
 I dont know. It felt far.
 What?
 I type 90.
 Its true.
 70? How many do you type?
 Come on. Tell me.
 You have to tell me now.
 No, its, thats respectable.
 So ok. Im watching the movie, by myself...
 Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
 And, Im freaking out.
 That movie is so scary!
 But Im holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
 Because I got it at Blockbuster and they dont put the pictures on the box.
 Would I make that up?
 Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
 I have one kitchen.
 Its actually...
 Three kitchens?
  Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
 Um. Ok, bye.
 No, I was um...
 You have to go?
 No, I should probably go too.
 I mean, yeah.
 Bye Jim.
 Really you do. I love the material.
 I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
 Oh, I dont know. I havent decided yet.
 I just feel kind of tired, you know.
 Maybe. I just ...I dont really have anyone to go with.
 Very official.
 I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least Im not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
 Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
 Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
 Its hot in there. Hows the naan?
 I am. You should come dance with us.
 No one.
 Here.
 Yeah.
 Uh... no.
 Well, you were never really engaged.
 Yeah.
 I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
 What are you doing?
 Im rejecting your...
 ...kiss.
 If you sit in the back.
 You say one more word; Im stopping the car.
 Are you okay?
 What did Jan want?
 What cant you tell me?
 What?!
 You just said that were gonna be gone...?
 Michael, whats going on?
 Its a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe thatll stop now.
 Oh, good... youre bringing Dwight.
 Hes not here. I dont know where he is.
 Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
 Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
 Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
 I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
 Thats, um... I hadnt thought about it, huh.
 Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
 No thanks, guys.
 Have fun though.
 Really? Where did you hear that?
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, me too.
 Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. Theres another annoying boss, another desk, Id have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
 Hey!
 Howd the run go?
 Thats great!
 Because he accomplished something.
 Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
 Really?
 Oh, Ill just time him later.
 Yeah. Are you ready?
 Set
 Go!
 Am I being mean to Dwight? I dont know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isnt even a stopwatch. Its a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if youre going to beat Toby.
 I should probably get back to work.
 Good morning!
 Okay.
 Yes! Im in a good mood today! Im excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. Thats always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
 Hi!
 Im Pam.
 Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
 Oh my god! Its really you!
 I know. I dont care.
 Its really good to see you.
 You wont be disappointed.
 Hey.
 What happened to grape soda?
 Oh. Youve changed so much.
 So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
 Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
 Yeah. I know, me too.
 The days going fine. Its been a little chaotic but its fine. Its great! A lot of distractions. But, its good.
 Hey!
 Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
 Whats up?
 What do you mean?
 Oh. Thats totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
 Were friends. Well always be friends.
 Its good to have you back.
 Ohhhh! Shes absolutely adorable!
 ...Oh, sorry. Hes--hes dressed all in pink.
 ...Oh. Thats... fun for him.
  Who is it?
 Why would anyone go to jail for that?
 Okay. Angela?
 My dad.
 What was prison like?
 Yeah, some days I never go outside.
 They have art classes?
 Kinda sounds like... prisons... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
 Wow... I--
 Wow. That was... wow.
 Michael, its freezing out.
 Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
 Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
 Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
 Dwight, what uh...
 Well, get it out of here.
 I would like it off my desk.
 Can I help you, Michael?
 Its behind you.
 Michael?
  I didnt, its from corporate.
 Yup.
 Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, Ill just tell you.
 For the past few months Ive been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
 Theyre considering him for a top secret mission. Theres his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised hed never ever tell.
 So... heres the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didnt wrap it.
 Oh.
 Oh yeah.
 No, I get it, of course. OK.
 Michael, whats going on?
 I know.
 OK, well, why are you laying like that?
 Like what?
 Well.. um I, I dont...
 I dont need to know.
 No, thank you.
 I feel like Ive been kinda cold to Karen and theres no real reason for it. I mean its not like shes ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldnt be cold to her.
 Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
 Um, usually like that.
 I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
 Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
 That could really be fun.
 You guys do a raffle?
 There is now. We just started it.
 Whats ours again?
 Oh right.
 Right, and if youre interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.
 You cant do that.
 Thats a great idea.
 You can have your snack in here.
 If youre using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, youre doing it wrong.
 Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
 Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
 Bye.
 Oh, yeah... Maybe.
 Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
 Our party is also starting now
 Good choice.
 We have vodka!
 I got goose bumps.
 What?
 Can I talk to you a second?
  In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
 Yeah, but we dont have a power cord.
 Mmm. Hmm.
 Well go tell everyone.
 Night.
 We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier.
 It costs seventy five dollars.
 Ohh...
 Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  thats nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
 OK.
 Its kind of serious.
 How was Jamaica?
 Thats good.
 Huh.
 Its kind of an impoverished country.
 But you cant today, were doing inventory.
 We couldnt do it without you, so we postponed.
 Oh my God. Is that Jan?
 On the left.
 Hey.
 You OK?
 You sure?
 Oh. You want to talk about it?
 Hmm.
 How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
 Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
 No, I didnt mind helping Jim with his problem. Thats what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
 Oh, dont worry about it. I mean, its better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, its Jan on the phone for you.
 Hell call you back. OK, great.
 Hey.
 What are you doing out here?
 Jan called. Shes coming in later to talk to you.
 Thats all she said.
 Sorry?
 Oh, yeah, no. Dont worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
 Sure.
 What? No, its not... its nothing.
 Yeah.
  Thanks. You dont need to stay here.
 Yeah.
 Great.
 Who is Long Tim?
 I would love to meet Long Tim.
 Yeah.
 Ok. Bye Harvey.
 Really?
 Ok. Sure.
 Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
 Thats great.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  This is Pam. I did?
 Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And Id like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
 Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
 $100.
 Cool. Congratulations.
 Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
 Oh.
 Oh?
 Hmm. I dont think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
 No, thanks. I had some already.
 Oh, but, hey, Jim.
 I won an art contest today.
 Thanks.
 I sent in one of my watercolors.
 It was the new one I did.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
 Oh, that wasnt the night crew. That was Dwight.
 Oh, Im kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
 Nope.
  Hmm.
 Angela?
 Is everything okay?
 Yeah.
 I think we broke his brain.
 No, I will not.
 What?
 No.  No.
 Somethings up with Jim and Karen.  Not that Ive been eavesdropping.  Its not really any of my business, but Ive gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jims neck.
 Hey.
 Ugh.
 Everything okay?
 Well you seem a little tired.
 You should get more sleep.
 Never underestimate the power of a good nights sleep.
 When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
 Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
 Yeah.  Dont fall asleep at your desk.   Oh my God.
 I think thats champagne.
 But dont you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
 Okay Ben Franklin!
 Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
 Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
 What do you mean?
 Oh yeah.
 Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, youre going out with Jim.  Im not going out with Jim.  Youre dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
 Im not into Jim.  Yeah.
 Yeah.  Sorry.
 Um, what?
 Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
 I know.
 Didnt Ben Franklin have syphilis?
 Ohhh.
 Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan Im totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
 Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
 Thanks.
 Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like Wait, thought I called that off.
 Also, Pam and Roy.
 Thats my dress.
 What do you mean?
 Oh... um... no.  Thats... um... Thats actually fine
 Okay, thats a lot of good ideas. Thanks
 Hey.
 Youre kidding me, right?
 Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
 Yeah.
 Its okay.
 Hey!
 Oh... Im pacing myself.
 No. Im such a dorky dancer.
 Yeah, thats weird. I thought they only played the Police.
 Okay, just so you know, its just the students from my class in a little studio.
 Thanks.
 Im really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I dont mean it to be braggy.
 You too.
 Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
 Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
 I mean, its not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
 Dwight, what are you doing?
 Oh! No, you should go.
 ...And its all from the same series.
 Called Impressions.
 Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
 I hope so.
 I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you?
 Hey, Kenny.
 Yeah, Ill just, Ill drive myself home.
 Maybe, Im a little tired.
 Thank you.
 Oh, Michael.
 Yep.
 What do you mean?
 Um... you wanna buy it?
 Uh-huh.
  ... Thank you.
 Do you have something in your pocket?
 No thank you.
 So we shouldnt help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
 No, no.
 Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richards for happy hour. You should come.
 Ok, well, were going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. Im serious! If youre going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
 I have decided that Im going to be more honest. Im going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol Pammy is getting what she wants. And, dont call me Pammy.
 Oh, that duck is so cute.
 Hey guys.
 Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
 Hey. You made it.
 Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
  Oh.  No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
 Nice job.
 Oh yeah?
 Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
 Hey, dont you have a daughter?
 I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
 Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there cant be any secrets between us.
 Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
 He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
 Just listen.
 Dont yell!
 This is over.
 ROY!
 Roy dont!
 I really dont want to talk about it.  I dont mean to be rude, but I just... I dont want to comment on what happened.  It
 Oh my God, thats a womans suit!
 Michael, the pants dont have any pockets.
||
 Its been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
 Sorry I almost got you killed.
 He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  Its just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
 Not anymore.  Its, um... Its completely over now.
 Jim... I am really... sorry.
 I dont know.
 Im sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
 Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
 No, there were a lot of reasons.
 I know.
 Oh, welcome back, Andy.
 Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
 Its called being smart.
 I dont know how the whole betting thing started, but its fun.
 Ten...
 47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
 I dont understand the question.
 Yeah...
 Its really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
 So, youre okay?
 Hey Creed.
 Hey.
 Yes!
 What are the odds that this is in any way real?
 Oh... God.  Oh my God, hes gonna jump.
 Yeah...
 Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
 Come down and... open it and youll see.
 Dwight, what are you---
  Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
 Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
 Were having a press conference?
 Yes, Ill be sure someone returns your call.  Im so sorry.  Bye.
 Its just the Scranton Times...
 You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
 Yes.
 Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a womans touch.
 Cut.
 Cut.
 One day for what?
 OK.
 Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
 Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
  Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
 What? Really?
 Oh, my God.
  Can you tell us what happened?
  Its just, like, so creepy.
 Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
 Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
 Its disgusting and demeaning.
 Phallus?
 I dont often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
 Thats OK. I dont feel like answering phones.
  "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.
 Yeah.
 Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
  Oh.
 Oh, yeah. You really shouldnt litter.
 What do you want to dish about?
 OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
 Michael, you shouldnt do anything that youre uncomfortable with.
 Oh, my God.
 Michael, you need to get out of this.
 No, normal women dont do stuff like that. This is bad.
 Read the pros first.
 What was the last one?
 Michael... you shouldnt be with someone who doesnt make you happy.
 Maybe. But it sounds like youre just wrong for each other.
 No one said it has no calories.
 Im kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I dont need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
 Dont answer it.
 Here, uh... Meredith? Why dont you put your hazards on.
 I think Ive got it.
 I dont think we really need that, Michael.
 You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobes already coming in handy.  Coming!
 Good luck, Michael.
 Dont leave a -
 About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
 Michael?
 David Wallace is on line one.
 Oh, great. I forgot mine and Im wearing a two piece.
 Thanks Toby.
 I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
 You want me to write down peoples indefinable qualities?
 I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldnt I have the most boring job on beach day?
 Like what?
 Well... no, I dont... exactly... what?
 Theres nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.
 Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
 Whens the contest?
 How am I supposed to... get...
 I think theyre even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I dont really know how to compare those units.
 I really doubt it, Michael.
 Im gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. Thats the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
 Id like to try it.
 But Im not kidding.  I really want to do it.
 Do you want us to count to three?
 Michael, do something!
  Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
  Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldnt even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didnt any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. Its like sometimes some of you act like I dont even exist.   Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now were not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldnt have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didnt care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now youre with someone else. And thats... fine. Its... whatever. Thats not what... Im not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that Im just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. Its a good day.
 Hey. I think it looks great.
 After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where hes coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you.
 Hey.
 Um, about the beach...
 Oh, no its not that, Ive actually been thinking that for a long time, and Im glad I said it. I just... Im sorry if it made you feel weird.
 Wow, very funny.
||
 Hes from that company in Pitts...
 What do you want me to do?
 What about Meredith?
 So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
 Uh, sure.
 I really hope you get the job.
 Just dont get back together with her.
 This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
 Youre so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
 Right.
 Oh my God.
 No, its fine.  Im sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
  Good luck.
 Im happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe Im being cliche.  I dont care.  Cause I am what I am.  Thats Popeye.
 What happened?
 Thank you.
 Really?
 You will be your own assistant.
 Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
 I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do."
 Then who do you think will get the job?
  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
 I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
 Howd it go?
 Did... Karen get the job?
 Dwight, hello.
 No, I dont know what the future holds, but... Im optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day Ill find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... Im not gay.
 Medium rare.  Thanks.
 I know.
 Well, I wish you would.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, Ill transfer you.
 I havent heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldnt he?  Hes totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... thats OK.  Were friends.  And Im sure well stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  Its OK.  Im totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally---
 Yes.
  Im sorry, what was the question?
