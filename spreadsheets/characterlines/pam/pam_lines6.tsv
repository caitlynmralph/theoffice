  This is the last day of our summer interns. Its been nice. We havent had interns for a while, ever since Michaels Monica Lewinsky incident.  He didnt do anything sexual.  He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes.  It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
 Nobody.
  We havent told anyone Im pregnant.
 Yeah, we dont want them at the wedding thinking Jims being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
 Nope.
 Cant back out now, Halpert.
 No, keep it up.
 Just keep it to yourself then.
 What?
 Why did that come into your brain?
 Who did you tell?
 Nobody!
 Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Lets pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
  Michael?  Hes over here!
  Where are you going?
 Dont get on it.
 Dont... get... on. Do not.
 Step away.
 Jim.
 Stop. Dont. Just...
 Yes.
 Okay.
  Its clear why we were trying not to tell people. Thats clear now.
  Youre right. We shouldve realized that you are an equal part of this.
  You called Stanleys wife?
 If you talk to her, youre gonna tell her about Stanley, and thats gonna seem more suspicious.
 Michael, please dont.
   Hey, Good luck.
   Okay, its just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
   Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
    Ummm, I dont know.
   Did I?  Doesnt sound like me, not very superstitious.
   Please dont talk about my breast milk.
   Yeah.
   Hey Kelly.
   Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
   I dont know, he hasnt RSVPd yet.
   We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.   Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls.   Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
   Hey Ryan.
   So, I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding.
   It costs about $75 per person.
   Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not?
   Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
   Kelly Kapoor, yes.
   Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
   Well, you have to choose a food option and theres information in there about directions and lodging...
   You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
   To ask for directions..
    And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
   So rude, right?
    Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  Its incredible.
 I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, Im also pregnant.
 We did, but mostly because people expect us to. Were also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
 Its awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesnt Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
 Oh, good.
 No, were not.
 I dont think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Is this what Ive become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" Thats the first time Ive seen it in writing!
 Why arent there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
 Jim?
 Yeah, I mean, if its all the same for you.
 $100 now for sure.
 Yeah. No, no, Ill um-- the hundred. Ill just take the hundred.
 How sure is this?
 The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
 Im sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
 Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
 I dont think Im asking for too much. I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
 Yeah, but arent you supposed to do that to our... no. Its great.
 Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
 Well, were thinking of my grandmother who we havent told and is very old-fashioned.
 You know, Angela, you dont have to come to the wedding.
 Next time were all in this room Jim and I will be married.
 Thank you, Dwight.
 See you later.
  Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
 She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
 Yeah.
 Oh.
 We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
 Can we take a look at the suite now?
 Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
 Im gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
 Oh, Mema? Shes the one in the teal suit. Shes the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
 Hey, Mema.
 Oh. Thank you... but nobodys perfect.
 Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. Shes also my maid of honor.
 Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
 She has a boyfriend. Hes out of town.
 Like... a year.
 Michael.
 Michael. Stop.
 Mema.
 Hey, smooth guys.
 Memas not coming to the wedding. Shes leaving tomorrow morning.
 I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
 I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
  Nevermind.
 Yeah.
 No.
 What?
 Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
  Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
 He tore his scrotum dancing.
 He is in my room icing his balls.
 Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
  Your brothers took you out drinking?
 Thats Michael.  Youre out with Michael?
 Okay, fine.  Ill take him.
 Are you pushing me off the phone?
 Goodbye.
  Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
  Look, Im not the one who asked you to do a split when youve never done one before.
 My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  Thats my job.
 Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
 Thank you weirdo.
  Okay, here I come.
  Thanks mom.
  He does.
  Yes. Thank you, mom.
 Okay great.   Yeah, Ill see you in a second.   Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no!
 Can you come here please?
 No.  No, but Im allowing it.  Just come here.
 Hey.
 Terrible.
 My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and Im five months pregnant that Im not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
  Thank you.
  No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--
  Everyones driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andys scrotum.   And my mom wont stop freaking out about my dads new girlfriend.   This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
  You look great.
  Mm-hmm.
  Yes I did.
   Go ahead.  I think its your turn.
  Yeah, Im okay.
 Saw it.
 Hey Oscar.  Its Pam. Hey. Were on our honeymoon.
 Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
  Are you kidding me?
 Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really cant handle the fact that youre calling us here!
 Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
 It really was.
 Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
  Frank and beans!
 Hi, Michael.
 Some candy.
 Thats it.
 Its good to be home.
 Hey!
 Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
 Awesome! Ill leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
  I think itll be okay.
 Great.
 Frank and beans!  So whatd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
 Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we?
 Come on, itll take two seconds.
||
 Wow, Botticellis, that sounds like a special occasion.
  I dont know. I think Michael has a date.
  I think you have a date.
 Come on.
 Oh, thats too bad.
 Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
 Of course.
 Oh.
 Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
 No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
||
  How could you do this to me? Hes my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
 Thank you.
 You need to be more upset about this. Shes your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
  Haha!  Ha ha ha.
  I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.
  I love it, conservation.  Lets start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.     No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!
  Im not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
  Dont call my mother your lover.
  Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
  Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
  Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybodys mom...
  Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
  You are never going to be my father, you get out!
  Me too...
  Hey.
  Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
  Well, he could still... Im sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
  Sure, whats up?
   Whats the matter, you cant fight your own battles?
   Oh, would that make you feel better?
  You can tell Michael that Im not leaving.
  Michael, youre just her rebound!
   What!  You knew?
  Mmmmm, yes!
  Then whyd you even offer!?
  Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
  Whats that supposed to mean?
  Shut it!
    Awww, he did that for me?
  Mmmm.
  Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.
  Maybe Im overreacting.
  But I dont think I am.
 Here we are outside-
 - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
 The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
 Here it is.  Suite 401.
 I know. Now you dont have to.
  Oh. No, no.  Were not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
 And wed like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
 Its ok.
 Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
 Yeah.
 You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
 You blew the sale, you idiot.
 Oh-  Thank you.
 Well, you know.
 He loves to eat.
 I love to watch him dance.
 And Ill just watch him.
 Yes.
 Mmm-hmm.
 It was, sweetie.
 Yeah, well, thatll happen.
 Sometimes were so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
 Yeah, I guess.
 If Im being completely honest, I couldve done without the belly kiss.
 Yeah. Way too much.
 I mean, what the hell was that?
 When you cried?
 Youre fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
 Hmm.
 Well, are you dating anyone?
 Ah.
 Ah.
 Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
 Ok.
 Mmm-hmm.
 No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. Hes really cool.
 Yeah, he is.
 Thats... right. Hes like Marlon Brando.
 I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
 Oh, no thank you.
  I have an early lunch.
  Michaels been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I dont know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today hes planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
 Hey!   Hey. Happy birthday.
  I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
  Kevin!
 Yes, lets go.
 Oh, you guys.  Just one second.   Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I dont think I can go to lunch.
  I know.  Isnt that always how it goes?
 I want to handle it.
  I feel like its--
  Yeah-- its exciting.
  Thank you.
  Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didnt even blow it.
  I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
  Michael, you did all this?
 So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
 49 again? Thats nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
  Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
 Please be Grandma.
  I want you to be Grandma.
  Yay, Grandma!
 Maybe.
 What about your gift Michael?
  He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
 Aww--
 Thats amazing.
 Yeah.
  Thats really nice Michael.
  Home run Michael.
 Hey. Whered you go?
  And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
 Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  Its time for cake.
  Cakes really good.
  Michael.  Michael ,its okay.
  I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
 Well--
 Michael.
 What?
 I am working.
 Really?
 Really?
 Why?
  I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
  I have the worst attitude of any person here.
  Yeah, Ill take it.
  Youre bribing me?
  I want to hit you.
  I want to hit you.  Ill do that.
 No.  Are you kidding?
  No.  I dont think I can hit you in the office.
  So, um... well do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  Im going to hit you as hard as I can.
 Okay.
 See you then.
 Oh...
  Right.
 Okay.
  Okay wait-- its-- youre saying it comes from the foot.
 Okay.
 Wow!
  Are you ready?
  You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
 Michael, you have to put your hands down.
  What are you sorry for?
  How about for dating my mom?
  And dumping her on her birthday.
  Okay-- just-- dont ever date a member of my family again.
  Are you okay?
  Youre okay.
 No.  You were right.
  Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
  Who are you?
  Ill go.     My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
  Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than Id hurt a June bug.
  I do not.
  I think Michael may have snapped.
  Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
  Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  Im trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I cant think of one.
  I should just go.    Where to now Caleb?
    Whats the news?
   It wasnt me.  Im not goin down for this!
  Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.
 Oh my God, you guys, look. Its Recyclops.
 The thing I like most about Recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child.
 A world where you truly can be anything you want.
 Thats great.
 Sure.
 Dont do the twirl.
 Stuff gets around. I dont participate.
 I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
 Can you actually fire people?
 Well, I cant really imagine you yelling at anyone.
 Oh. Ok. Ive heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, Hey, look. We parked over here!.
 Well, youll figure it out.
  Looks great.
 Okay.   The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
 Michael, why did you promise that?
 No Michael, why would you promise that?
 Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing youve done.
 Its terrible.
 Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse its going to get.
 No!
 You have to tell them.
 Its fine.  Erin, youre going to go.  And youre going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
  Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesnt Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and well move on.
 Thank you.
 No, wait, come on.  I didnt miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
 Yup.
 Ah!
 Is it, is it fake?
 So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
 You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if its a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
 Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.   I think my water just broke!
 Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
 Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
 Have you talked to him?
 Matt?
 Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
 Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
 Oscars pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
 Okay.
 Yes! Theyre the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
 How could we do what?
 Twelve drummers drumming.
 Hello.
 Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
 It might seem crazy, but since theres no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflins highest ranking employee. So, thats where we are.
 For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
 Good to meet you.
 Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
  Yep, yep.
 Yep.
 Yes.
 Oh, Michael.
 No, dont!
 What do you want us to do?
 Because were usually not on the same page.
 Hey.
 Oh, you mapquested it. Its four blocks away.
 We found a great local daycare. Its rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means its also really hard to get into.
 Were hoping our interview seals the deal.
 Okay. Okay. Yeah.
 Theres a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
 What?
 Who? The -
 The guy were meeting with?
 Hi Jerry.
 Its lovely.
 Ok, youve got to pull it together.
 Hes uncomfortable because youre acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
 Thats the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
 Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
 Maybe, because it doesnt seem to be going super well.
 Nope. Cause were really nice people but you dont seem to like us.
 So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
  Oh, Michael marked his heights. Hes grown!
 Michael, stop.
 Michael...
  He looks happy.
   I just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, Im pregnant...  Great, well, Ill write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
  There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
  Kevin, youre such a gourmand.
  Hmm.
  Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
  No, no.  I still have time.
  Im having contractions, but theyre irregular and far apart.  So Im not really in labor, Im near labor.
  If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
  I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
  Ooh.
  You know the babys not going to live here, right?
  Okay, okay, were not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
  Everythings fine.  We have plenty of time.
  Hold on, hold on.  It isnt midnight yet.
  No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
  Im going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
  Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
  Five minutes apart.
  Okay, stop watching me.
  Mm-hmm.
  Not until midnight.
  Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I dont think Im going to make it until midnight if Im just sitting here thinking about it.
  Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
  Oh, thanks, Kelly.
  Yes, this is the only time Im ever going to make this request.
  Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
  Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but youre really distracting me from my distractions.
  Why dont you go do some work?
  I know, you dont like to be frazzled.
  Okay.
  Hey.  Im not going to get in the car, because I know if I do youll try to drive me to the hospital.
  Okay, Jim.
  Everything is fine.  You dont have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  Shes not coming out for a while, okay?
  I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldnt wait...  Oh, God, dont be mad.
  Mm-hmm.
  I know.
  Good.
  Okay.
  Oh, yeah, my water broke.
    Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
  No, not yet, Michael.
  Oh, wow, its almost time for ultra feast!  Wheres Kevin?
  There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  Ill get there.  And if I dont get there, I dont get there.
  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Im fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said its still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
  Nope.  No, no, thats better.  That wasnt even the worst of them.  Im fine.
  Theyre not that bad still, babe.
  No, its passing, its fine.  Its okay.
  No, its passing, its fine.
  Ah, no, it passed.  Its good.
  Okay, Im not going.  Im not...  Its fine.    Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  Im not going today because I cant do it, I dont think I can do it.
  Oh, God.  Oh, no.
  Jim, we waited too long!
  I dont want to have my baby here.
  The hospital.
  A baby.
  Dwight, get away!
  Michael!
  Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
  Wait, wait.  My iPods not in here!
  It has the birth song on it!
  Jim, I dont want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
  I dont know!  Lets go by the house and get it.  Its only twenty minutes past the hospital!
  Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think its on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
  Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen its under the...
  Dwight just listen!  Its underneath...
  Yes.
  No, Jim, stay!
  Okay.
  This is happening!
  Oh, my God.
    Shes incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
  Okay.
  Oh, thank God.  I havent had caffeine in nine months.
  Okay.
  Love you, mom.
  Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
  Again, no pants.
  Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
  Good.
  Doesnt she sleep here?
    Oh, big yawn.
  One, and then wrap around.  Its okay.  Hold that arm down.
  Shes not gonna...  Just...
  Go.
  I dont know.  I just, I cant tell if shes getting anything.
  Doesnt feel right.
  How does one do that?
  Do you want to try it, Jim?
  I cant tell if shes getting anything.  It just doesnt really feel right.
  Even if shes not getting anything?
  No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
  Shes just, shes really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
  Maybe itll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
  I know.
  Yes?
  Um, yeah, that would be great.
  So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
  Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I cant tell if Im really producing.  I dont know if shes getting anything.
  Okay.
  Okay.
  No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
  No.  It just feels like pressure.
  Okay.  So, Im just not sure if Im releasing, though.  Im not sure if...
  Okay.  Aw, thank you.
  Okay.
  Oh, shoot.
  Shoot, she fell off.
  Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
  Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think itd be weird if you did it.
    Jim, Jim, get her.
  Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
  I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
  Oh, my God.  I didnt even have to do the "C thing."
  Aw, were doing it.
  Were really parents now.
  Oh, hey, Isabelle.
  Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but shes totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I dont want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
  Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
  Oh, my gosh.
  No, not at all.
  Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she wont latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
  Okay, please hurry.
  Oh, yeah, sorry.
  Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
  Hi.  We did it.
  I used a variation of your move.
 Its kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that shes very ironic.
  Hey baby, whats up?
 Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
 He means his mopey place, its under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
 Yes! Yes! I would love to!
 Its been so long since Ive been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanleys going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
I want her to meet Michael.
Theyre both single, I have a sense they might-
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Hey, how are you?
Aw!
Yeah!
Hey, Michael.
This is my friend Julie.
Julie laughs at everything.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
You want to play pool?
Ok.
Hey, Michael, where have you been?
Why are you wearing a hat now?
Maybe.
Maybe it should come from a man.
Hey, Michael, why dont you just get down.
Ok, um, why dont we just finish the game? Michael, its your shot.
You guys are stripes, I think...
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Really?
Im sorry, hes not usually like that.
Hes more, just... like... you can go.
Okay. Bye.
Yeah.
Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Okay, we have to get home.
Not at all.
 Hey, thanks.
 Its my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
  Oh. You couldnt have watered it?
 Its nice to see you again, Dwight.
  Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
 No, no, hes right.
 Thats weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
 You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
 Mm.  Meredith!
 What are you doing?!
 Relax?!
 Give it back to me now.
 Its disgusting!
 Its not sterile!
 Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
 No, no never.
  "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful."
 What? What do you mean, suspend me?
 Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
 Yeah. And he worked here too.
 No, no it wasnt Andy. It wasnt. It doesnt matter. Its not about who youve been with. Its about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
 Thank you.
  Hey Toby.
 Very interesting.
  Thanks Toby.
 I dont think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
 Yeah. "I vant to count to ten".
 That would have been funny.
 You know, maybe theres an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like,  "I just delivered a baby. They didnt offer me a guarantee."
 This is our first joint sales pitch. I think were gonna work really well together.
 We have good give and take.  I give, he takes.
  Yee.
 Oh, no were actually married. Were not brother and sister.
 Ill have one.
 Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldnt still be here.
 What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
 Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
 Who cares?  Its not that huge a sale.
 Dont act like you understood anything that guy said.  Good luck, wingman.
 Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
 You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
 I was after your money.
 Yes, it was.
 Hmm?
 Um... I think its really, really unlikely.
 Really unlikely. But I cant say that its impossible.
 Im not saying shes in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
 Hey, Michael.  How you doing?
 You know what, Michael? For what its worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
 Michael...
 She doesnt want you to return the barrette. Shes not interested in you.
 Im sorry.
 Michael!
 It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight."
 Stanley got to go.
 No, Michael, no.
 You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
 That is right. Dont make any more of it.
 How what?
 You could start by concluding this meeting.
 Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
 Amok. It means, dont let your imagination run out of control.
 Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
 Oh!...
 Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
 No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
 Michael. Okay, Im... Im going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
 Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
 And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship youre in.
 Helene.
 My mother.
 My mother, Helene.
 Hmm? Oh. Its probably nothing.
 Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasnt Michael.
 No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
 So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  Its Cece.  Shes never gonna do anything wrong.
 Hey, Michael.
 Im sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
 I lied its personal. Its about me and Jim. Were... I just... youre the only person I can talk to.
 And...
 No, not... were not... were not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
 Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
  I need you to sign this! So bad!
 I love ... this idea is neat. Ive never been. It sounds lovely.
  Youre gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing.  Are you a golfer?
 Absolutely.
 I dont know who he is.
 What?
 You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
 You have to settle down first.
 Okay. Okay. Yes.
 Yeah, but you have to calm...
 Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
  Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
  Did she see me?
  What flavors did you get?
   Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
  No, no, no, its fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open em up.
  Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so were just trying to get out in front of this.
   Yeah, or no... well... I dont know. Im sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise Id be running this.
  And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
  Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he gets like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you dont know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
  No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
  Leave!
  Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
  Thats awesome. You want some ice cream?
  Could he still be seeing her?
  Me too!
  Hey Michael.
  We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
  We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
  Yes.
   Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
  Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
  You were supposed to be the Lookout.
  So embarrassing.
  We will be well-rested tomorrow.
  I dont think those were yours to take.
  Did you talk to him?
  You talked to the man whose wife youre having an affair with.
  I dont think Im gonna make it.
   It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
  Well, it does and it doesnt.
  You sleep in the warehouse?
  Okay.
 It was me.
 Okay. Im talking to this woman at daycare...
 Shes telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
 Her husbands a reporter.
 So now everyone hates Andy, and its this whole mess, and I dont know what to do.
 I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
 I dont know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I dont want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
 That fast?
  Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what youre saying to me.
 Yeah, you didnt need to actually say it.
  I have never seen so many parking tickets.
 Um...
 Were not going for yogurt.
 Wouldnt we get fired for smashing all the computers?
 I dont think thats a good idea.
 Nobodys going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then well all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
 Yes, its totally obvious.
