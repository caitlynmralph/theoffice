  Hey. What are you doing?
 Sorry.
 It was really funny.
 I love you.
 Why is there a circle with a line through it?
 Or enough for everyone?
 Get whatever you want, on me.
 I dont know. That usually works.
 I feel horrible for blowing Jims prank. I dont know if you can tell, but hes mildly upset. And Dwight hasnt been messed with in a while, so hes become a monster. I need to make this right.
 Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
 Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
 Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
 There we go.
 Lets just calm down.
 I dont-
 Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
 Dwight, what are you doing!? Weve only been in here for, like, two seconds!
 Youve gotta be kidding me.
 Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
 I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
 Well, you know... they dont call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
 They do call me that.
 Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, theres pee on the floor.
 Yeah.
 Stop drinking the water! Stop!
  We signed Cici up for this daycare. Its on the other side of town. The traffic...
  Were you painting in the dark?
  I dont really think we need...
  Yeah.
  And a soy sauce packet.
   Look, Im not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
  I cant do this. I dont have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
  Tell me Im good at sales.
  The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess thats fair.
  Yeah, what happened Dwight?
  So what happened?
   I am. I am the office administrator!
  Oh, were not interested. Were not interested at all.
  There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. Thats the main way. But this could work.
  A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isnt there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
  Thanks! Yeah, so Im just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
  I get paid $40,000 per year.
  Maybe $50,000.
  No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
  I liked them.
  Hey, do you have a second?
  Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, Ive been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
  And, I havent gotten paid yet. Im not blaming you.
  I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
  Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
  Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to...
  There are a lot of one person departments here, so, theres a lot of department heads. But Im off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
  We can do that.
  Easily.
  But of course!
  So weird that there is no paperwork.
  Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
  Admit what?
  Say it.
  Say that Im lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
  Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
  Sure. Anything else?
 Ill get it right away.
  The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 200 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
 Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. Im really sorry.
 Well keep looking.
 I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
 Yeah.
 Hey, Erin, its Pam. How ya doing? No, no, dont put Cece on the phone, because she cant talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everythings going. Yeah? Yeah? Its good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, its fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, hes really sorry you couldnt make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. Were having a great time. Oh, theyre flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everythings fine!
 We can relax.
 Sounds like Cece.
  Oh, my God! Go, go!
 Why are you here?
 What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I dont... you know, babies shouldnt have ice cream, by the way.
 You know what? It doesnt matter. It doesnt matter.
 Okay.
 Not together!
 This night was a disaster.
 Yeah?
 Get it.
 Lets get our juice on.
 No. No no no!
  Yes!
 Yeah, go away.
 What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
 Its just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
 Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really dont know what that is.
 Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
 Andy thats way too personal of a question.
 Okay.
  Michael!
 Come on, Michael! Yeah!
 Not the car!
 Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
 Thats fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
 No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right?
 You dont look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
 You dont?
 Not really. Its kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
  Bye, Stanley! Love you!
 People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe youve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
 What?
 Im supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when Im standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesnt want to put his costume on.
 We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
 Except where Juliet doesnt have that great a time and Romeo doesnt call back after two dates.
 But Ive learned to love again.  Hes a cartoon sailor.
 And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
  Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
 Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! Its not even a history.
 It was two.
 No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I dont know, you never called me back, so...
 Yeah?  It was though, thats what happened.
 Hmm-mm.
 Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you cant vote for yourself.
 Michael, this is a bad idea.
 Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
 Angela as the nurse!
 Id remember talking about Jim. That wasnt it.
 I did. And its just one of those things thats going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didnt he? I have no idea why."
 Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?  Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
 Oh, wow!
 Aww, my hero!
 Okay, everyone, Ive tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
 I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. Its that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, theyve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
 One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
 Oh, no, its just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.
 Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Dont come in if youre sick.
 And get your flu shot. Also, Im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
 Im not - Im not going to do that. Im not going to do that.
 Ceces getting christened today.
 Everyone from work is here. We werent planning on that.
 Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
 Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, Im so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know youre not Ceces godfather.
 Im sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. Im so sorry.
 Okay, thank you.
 Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
 No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. Theyre a great couple. You should meet them later.
 Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
  Somebody needs a change.
 Well, she cant bring this up with her.
  What?
 Honey, no.
 No, no.
 We have an extra outfit in the bag.
 You said you checked it.
 Wow.
 We just had to add a few more tables. We werent expecting this many people.
 Nope, and were gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed em all.
  Hm. Dont listen to her. Shes just jealous cause she doesnt get to come home to someone as cute as you.
 I dont know. Im just hungry.
  Cece went down.
 Well, if it makes you feel better, I didnt get one either.
 Who the heck was that?
 We need more food. Ill go get some subs and sodas.
  Honey.
 Did you lose Cece?
 Shes up! Great!
 Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means Im up all day and Im up all night. And if it doesnt stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
  Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. Its closer to the TV. Itll seem louder.
 You have a gun in your desk?
 Maybe I should go.
 If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
 I cant even talk about it.
 I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
 Its a miracle. She loves him.
 No no no no no! Shell wake up!
 Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? Ive always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
 Absolutely!
 Do it!
 Jim, just dont think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
 What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
 Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
 No no no, dont. I will go talk to Angela.
 The reverse cycling ends tonight!
  Hey in there. Its Pam. Its not Dwight! Dont think its Dwight!
 I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
 Yes! I have been so authorized.
 Okay.
 You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
 Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
 Lord of the Ring stuff? I dont know, Im just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
 Youre typing "Big Boobs"?
 Mm-Hmm?
 Okay.
 Oh, its okay.
 Let it go.
 Yes, I invested in WUPHF. Its actually a great idea and I cant believe it didnt exist before. And I know Ryans kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. Ive done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
 What do you want to say, Michael?
 Really?! Who?!
 Did you prank Dwight?
 Well, you like that.
 I love you, but Im kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
 Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
 Ryan, just tell us your plan.
 Oh, God!
 I move we sell!
 Sell.
 Hi, Michael.
 Oh, we dont recycle.
 Im sure no one asked you to do that.
 Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
 Michael, I...  I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that youve always felt with Ryan, where, like, youre best friends or youre his mentor or something?
 Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and hes taking advantage of you.
 And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
 Dont.
 Yeah, but in a jokey way where youre gonna start singing.
 Okay. Go Ahead.
 Do you mind?
 You dont have to do that.
 Are you okay, whats wrong?
 Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
 Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
 Im not going to do that.
 Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
 Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
 Sure.
  Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people hes worked with for years. His friends.
 An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
 Dwight take it down.
 Im serious, take it down or else.
 We can move out.
 So, does anyone wanna know where Ive been for the last 2 hours?
 I went out to look for a better office space.
 Not really, because I found one.
 Yup.
 Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
 Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you dont undo all the changes youve made, were moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
 Theyre not of Cece.
 This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
 Well, this building isnt far, and its much newer. Theres a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and its next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
 Koreans.
 White.
 Parley?
 So everyone here knows pirate code?
 Youve been watering down the soap?
 We need everything back the way it was.
 Thats a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed.
 Yeah?
 I know, because youre the reason were moving.
 Uhh, I think its something like umm...
 Umm, let me see.
 Oh, actually I dont know what I did with the one sheet. Yknow, thats the problem. You only have one sheet.
 Mmhmm.
 I lied about some aspects of the building.
 Theres no building... it doesnt exist.
 I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. Its just this Office Administrator thing, I dont wanna...
 Fail. I dont want to fail... again.
 And thats what you said about Art School, and thats what you said about sales.
 Well, Im not an artist, and Im not a salesman. So what would you call it?
 What?
 Well thanks.
 Hello, hello. Youre breaking the law.
 Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
 Okay lets go in. Im freezing.
 Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No ones putting this on their fridge.
 Okay.
 Im freezing.
 Im the office administrator now, which means Im basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
 It hardly looks fake. Its so lush.
 Great.
 Nope.
 Nashua got mp3 players.
 Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
 A party. Its not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
 Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
 Michael, Michael, wait we dont have, we dont have the budget for another party.
 I honestly think youre idealizing people here again, Michael. I dont think thats gonna happen.
 Hey.
 Yes. But dont get too excited, cause I didnt have a lot of time this year.
 Okay.
 Ive been working forever on Jims present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. Hell take a memory or a private joke, and hell create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes bear man. Wreaks havoc on the office. Its really good.
 No, it has the little...
 Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
 Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. Its just us.
 Oh, do you mean Darryl? Thats a great idea. Ill ask him.
 Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
 Cool.
 Hey, sorry, I really didnt want to come in. Its just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and were hoping we could borrow your truck.
 Okay. Sorry. Well uh, well leave you alone.
 Hey, how about this one?
 Maybe. I mean...
 Um, hey, Darryl, listen, its none of my business, but if I couldnt have Cece for Christmas, Id be really upset too.
 Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
 No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
 Bring her to the party. Yeah, well have Santa, and well play games with her. Itll be a lot of fun.
 Youll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
 Hey guys, the trees here.
 Who told you that?
 Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
 You guys, I dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
 Wow, an ultimatum.
 It doesnt really seem like you.
 So, cool right?
 Okay.
 Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
 I mean, help, if its something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
 No.
 Yup.
 No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
 Look at this.
 Jada, Darryl, Im so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
 Oh, my goodness.
 Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
 Thank you.
  I dont think hes in the ceiling, babe.
 Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?
  Oh, my God.
 I love it.
 Oh, um, its just, I didnt, I didnt have a lot of time, so thats just a place holder.
 Michael, wait!
 Thats good advice.
 Thats a sad story.
 Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everythings gonna be okay.
 I shouldnt tell you this, but... AJ wont commit to Holly. And shes gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose to her by the end of the year, its over.
 Really. And I dont know about you, but I dont know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
 So just be patient.
 Hey, sorry. Im ready.
 Oh... come on, bear man. Come on.
 Im sorry. I had no idea.
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
 What?
 What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God!  Honey? Jim? Jim!
 Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Years resolution on them, Ill collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
 Its gonna be fun.
 I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, shes awesome.
 Oh, hey, guys! Id like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Years resolution board.
 Hey, Dwight, Im collecting resolution cards.
 Why not?
 Learn to cook for one!
 Well, maybe youll meet someone.
 Angela.
 Make time for romance!
 I dont think so.
 No.
 Im not... Im not going to have...
 No! Just talk to her.
 Theres a plan.
 The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Whos been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
 Cool! Heres a little way to go gift from Sabre.
 Creed. I noticed you dont have a resolution on the board. Whats yours?
 How is it going?
 One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
 Yeah.
 But thats okay. Because its not about being perfect, its about trying.  In fact, why dont we go around and confess some of the ways that weve fudged on some of our resolutions?
 Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But thats fine.
 Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe Ill be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
 You dont have to do that, Kevin.
 Oh, Michael.
 Okay, Michael, just settle down.
 Kevin, dont! Come on!
 Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
 Okay, thats it.
  Lesson learned.
 Whats going on? Do you know that guy?
 "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
 I dont think thats a word.
 You want some help?
 Mm-hmm.
 K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
 No, it doesnt have to just be cow stuff, right?
 I think theres better...
 You could have just told us what you were thinking.
 Theres no yelling in that, either.
 Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
 I dont know. Theyre still in there.
 Stop. Out with it.
 Heres the story. That guy in there is Jims childhood friend, Tom.
 And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
 And Tom...
 And Jims mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
 Right. But howd you say it?
 Wait. Can you back up? Whats the story?
 Bye.
 Aw youll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game.
 All right, whatd you do?
 Whered you put it?
 Say it. Where?
 The fridge.
 The fridge, got it.
 Bye.
 This is Pam.
 Whats wrong?
 Jim, what?
 Oh God! What?!
 Ok. Shes ok?
 Understood.
 Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off?
 Alright, just call me after the doctor.
 Bye.
 Yeah.
 Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? Im not even kidding. Theyre pretty good.
 Well the first one has a surprise factor. "Im a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
 But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
 You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
 Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh, hey Dwight.
 No, he hasnt.
 No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
 Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time its convent, I just thought since you are out...
 Ok, well it wasnt obvious so...
 Ta-da!
 Yeah?
 Seriously?
 Oh! Ok.
 Guess not.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
 Hey. How you doing?
 Yeah.
 At least she lived a very long and Im sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When youre ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know were thinking about you.
 Its possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
 Im so sorry.
 How much did you give him?
 Wait. I dont have my scarf.
 Im missing my scarf. Oh.
  Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
 Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
 Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
 Yeah. What? Us?
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Thats weird. I mean, thats weird to have sex in the office. Thats where you work, right?
 You know, youre in a meeting, and nobody knows that youve had sex there, except for you and him.
 Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
 No, we werent.
 No.
 That was so embarrassing. Im gonna die.
 Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
 Besides, we have something those other people dont have, which is a home and a bed.
 No.
 We took a walk.
 Were all in it, from like years and years ago. Its like a home movie.
 Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didnt go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
 Wed love to see it!
 Okay everyone, I know were really excited to see this movie that everybodys in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so lets stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and well have a pure fun day! Okay?
 I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I dont wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right?
 Awwh, youre welcome.  My pleasure.
 I just helped someone out. It feels good.
 So you know the feeling.
  Hey, um...
 Hes seriously awful!
 United front...
 You have a computer Andy.
 Ok, but listen. We just dont have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
 Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
 See, this is what Im talking about.
 Sorry Andy.
  What the heck! Why do you have Erins computer!
 What? Erin is that true?
 Erin, its not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? Its not yours to give away.
 Im not freaking out, Andy.
 Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
 Switch the computers back Andy.
 Seriously.
 Now please.
 I dont know if theres really a private place in this office.
  You did that?
 Okay.  When did people sign-
 Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
 Okay, well I didnt think about it like that. Its just, I cant do anything about it. I cant replace that one unless that computer breaks.
 Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
  So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
 Andy, this is the deal we made.
 We should break this hinge maybe.
 Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
 Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.
 Yep. Lucked out.
 Yep, super lucky.
  Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
 Three.
 Im full on corrupt!
 Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
 Oh.
 Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didnt need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
 Its cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
 The signs will drive people inside.
 Oh, which one is decaf?
  Michael! Michael!
 Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
 Why do you need more gas?
 Is it a good message or a bad message?
 Are you proposing!?
 Wow.
 Yea. Yea no problem.
 Yep.
 Michael, youve had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
 This is terrible.
 You know what? Im gonna get a hose. Then well talk about it. Ok well figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
 Hey Michael everyones in the conference room.
 You called the meeting I dont..
 Michael.
 We are a family.
 And Ive always believed that we should all be involved in everyones personal lives, in a very major way.
 So about this proposal thing...
 Michael, shes perfect for you.
 So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that its safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
 Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didnt you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
 Holy s*** is that real?
 No shes going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
 No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
 Shes not gonna say no.
 You were scared?
 Congratulations!
 Well, it wasnt an affair.
 But, no, but we are a family.
 Cecelia.
 Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.
 Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
 Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
 Da-das.
 See, we knew it! If he just met her, hed understand.
 Whats going on?
 Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
 Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
 Youre right, youre right. Im a middle class broad.
 Yeah...  Hey, Erin, everything okay?
 Whats wrong?
 Why dont you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
 Dont you think its better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
 What?
 Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you dont love him. Just be honest with him.
 You didnt think to mention me huh?
  Why?
 Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
 Lets grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.
 In costumes!
 Whats wrong with cupcakes?
 Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
 We thought.
 So this is the dream team.
  Okay.
 Should we get toppings?
  What?
 Hot fudge?
  You should do more stuff like that.
 So Im going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
 Its a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
 Its not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
 I dont think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
  So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
 I dont, I dont think we sh-
  Okay, dont turn this into some feminist issue.
 You know what, I think we should get some other input.
 Oh, hey Michael! Im just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. Ill see you later.
||
  No he wasnt sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an awards member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
 Good morning, Deangelo.
 Okay.
 Because of the flowers.
 Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
 Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.    Shes got great experience.  We even considered making her Ceces godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but heres her resume.
 Okay.
 Oh my God, he hates me!
 I know.
 Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
 Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
 Oh wow, you werent kidding.
  Look.  Im juggling eggs and bowling balls.  Im juggling with one hand.  No hands.
 What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
  Why dont you talk to him about it?
 Why dont you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
 So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
 So, umm, is this your first office job then?
 Wow.
 Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
  Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
 So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
  Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but its really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
 Okay, well its just really loud.
 Youre back in.
 We could get Deangelo flowers.
 What have you done?
 Cant stay there all day.
 Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
 Stop stalling! Come on.
 You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
 Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
 Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
 Dwight, no gun, okay? Dont make us call Jo.
 You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
 You shot a gun off -
  What are we doing?
  We need a new manager.
   Should you really be so blatant about that?
  Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
   Its gorgeous, Angela.
   Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
  Thats not accurate.
  How is this on me?
  Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there were at least seven.
  Theyre the same picture.
  The Senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid.
  And dont say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
  Did you see him at a bathhouse?
  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
  Forget it. Im never gonna know what goes on there.
  Youre in the gay mafia.
  No.
  Im a woman. I would want to know.
  She does seem happy.
  Okay.
  Uh, just put him through to me.
  Hello! This is... the client.
  Yes.
  Great.
  Thank you, bye-bye.
  That was our dream wedding.
   I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
  A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
  No, I want you to say that you think the best person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
  Ohh, hey Gabe, Im sorry, we... we didnt get you a cake or anything. Were gonna miss you.
   Is that right?
  Well, okay!
