 Well. I dont know.
 What?
 Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
 You havent told me.
 Uh, yeah, the one...
 You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
 I have an important question for you.
 Are you going to Angelas cat party on Sunday?
 This is Mr. Scott.
 I dont think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I dont think its many little girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks theyre good.
 Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
 You just still have these messages from yesterday.
 What?
 Dont we all?
 Nothing.
 I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
 Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, hes on to me. Um...
||
 Yeah.
 So when are we going out?
 OK. Yeah.
 Hey.
 Roys my fiance. Weve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think were gonna get married in the spring.
 Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
 OK. Im gonna be a few minutes. So its only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
 You got a fax.
 What? Why?
 Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
 Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
 Are you serious?
 I cant believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and youre firing me.
 Youre a jerk.
 Hey.
 Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
 Its better, thanks.
 Yeah.
 Is...?
 Um... Are you...
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
 Yeah, Freecell.
 I know. I saw that.
 Im saving that cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
 Um, hi. How are you?
 Great.
 Thank you.
 Thats nice, Dwight.
 OK, I like your food.
 OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
  Mmmm.
 Oh.
 Sorry.
 Im not making any copies.
 Nothing new.
 Theres nothing new.
 Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the...
 No. I have a life.
 You should try it sometime.
 ... your problem.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Where are you?
 Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out cause the...
 No youre not.
 OK.
 Still no one calling.
 Dwight, what...
 OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
 This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
 Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
 Dwights health care memo. I told you about it.
 Michael, he made huge cuts.
 Where are you going?
 Im inventing new diseases.
 So, lets say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
 Nice.
 Its an epidemic.
  Hey, Jim. Its Pam.
 Good, how are you? Busy?
 Um, Im not bothering you, am I?
 You dont have anything youre doing?
 Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. Im not really doing anything.
 I might go to the mall.
 I need new shoes.
 Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
 Um... Actually, we dont have any staff birthdays coming up.
 Oh.
 Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
 But its not until next month.
 You still want to have a party?
 How about green?
 This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her.
 It is... her birthday.
 An alliance?
 What does that even mean?
  Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
 Um, I dont know, Im just like, Im going a little crazy cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
 Yeah, hes making me take notes on these meetings and Im, like, "These people are my friends." But hes all like, "This is confidential. You cant tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me youre not gonna say anything.
 OK, yeah.
 Hes in a box?
  Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just dont know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
 Happy Birthday.
 Oh, tell me, tell me.
  Thats perfect!
 Hey, Hey!
 Come on.
 Its just office pranks.
 My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesnt make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? Im kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
  No, no, I know that the warrantys expired, but isnt it supposed to last longer than two years if it isnt defective? OK, fine, three years.
 Please dont throw garbage at me.
 I dont think so Michael. Besides, I cant cheer against my fiance.
 Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
 Yeah, Im just forwarding the phones.
 Yeah, youre gonna need it.
  Im just saying, Roy is very competitive.
 And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
 Um, I think Im gonna be up at the lake.
 Woo!
 Mmm-hmm.
 Hey.
 Yeah, hes, uh, pretty good, huh?  Lets get you into a tub.
 Uh, Michael?
 Hey, theres a...
 Theres a person here...
 Theres...
 Theres a person here who wants to sell handbags.
 Okay, I told her youd talk to her.
 Okay.
 Theres an HR meeting in there at 1130.
 No.
 Thats a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
 Its nice having Katy around. Its another person for Michael to um, interact with.
 Were not dating, were engaged.
||
  Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
 Oh!
 Oh...
 Oh, God. Its sad. Its so sad.
||
 Youre horrible.
 Yeah, whats that?
 Im engaged. So...
 I wished, right?
 Yeah, I gave it to you.
 So, can I..?
||
 Thats what he said.
  Hi.
 Roy...
 Cut it out.
 Stop it.
  Cut it out.
 Stop.
  Stop, I cant breathe.
 Jim is a great guy. Hes like a brother to me.  Were like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
 Im bored.
 No, Im kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
 Really?
 What are you guys going to do?
 Thats great.
 Thats cool.
 I, I was gonna say, I think that um, were gonna help Roys cousin move.
 Cause Roys got a truck.
 Uh, huh. Yes.
 Great.
 Okay, Im gonna head back.
