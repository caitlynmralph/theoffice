 Ugh...
 You know what they say about a car wreck, where its so awful you cant look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
 Michael has taped
 Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. Its great.
  It wasnt. I swear.
 Were not laughing at you, Dwight.
 Um, just something somebody wrote.
 Um, its kind of private.
 Okay, now Im laughing at you.
 Youre taking away our bathroom?
 Michael...
 ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
 Um...
 Sorry.
 ...because thats what happens every time!
 No.
  No, I dont want to go, I dont want to.
 If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
 Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
 Ill just get a ride home from Angela.
 Oh good, Im just in time for Ping.
  Can I get a drink?
 No, no. Cause the ice melts and then its like second drink!
 Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
 Woo! Hey, I havent gotten one yet!
 More Dundies!
 Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
 Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech
 I have so many people to thank for this award.
 Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldnt have done it without them.  Thank you. Lets give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
 Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
 And, I feel God in this Chilis tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
 Nothing.
 What?
 Dwight, get off me!
 Oh my God!
 I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
 I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
 Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
 Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
 Bye.
 You are?
 My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesnt have a cell phone... which is cool cause its kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping shell walk in.
 Ive decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
 mmhmm.
 Oh really?
 Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Moms coming in today.
 Thanks, Kevin.
 Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
 Shes coming in today and maybe just dont joke around about that stuff in front of her.
 Thank you.
 Uh... my mothers coming.
 I dont have any DUIs so I can drive myself, but thanks.
  Oh my god!
 Hello!
 I love my Mom. Okay. Thats probably really the most obvious statement ever.
 Yeah. Im in charge of this whole area.
 This is where I used to keep my computer.
 But then I moved it.
 Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
 So this is like, um, an organization station...
 Hey!
 Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, its okay, because I am very used to killing time.
 Mom!
 No.
 Ten minutes.
 Then we can go to dinner.
 He said what?
||
 Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, its up to me to revive him.
 You see Dwights coffee mug?
 Sometimes when hes not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
 Here.
 Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
 Oh.
  You headed out?
  Ok.
  Have a great time.
  Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
  Yup.
  Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
||
  Yeah.
 Now the bronze are really blue, and theyre also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
 Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
 In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
 The thing about Jim, is when hes excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
 Go!  Go!  Go!
 Its Phyllis!
 Flonkerton.
 Are you sure you dont want to play?
 Come on Angela, dont you have a game?
 Well, lets play, what is it?
 Were friends.
 I made something for our closing ceremonies.
 Automatic voicemail.
||
 I have 59 voicemails.
 Sure.
 Really?
 Cool.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask whos calling? Just a second.
 Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess theyre like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I dont know! You know? Theyre just... She calls him, and they... You know, Im sorry. I feel like Im talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
  Hey! You can just give her your extension.
 ...Would You Rather?
 Legends of the Fall?
 Well, I kind of liked Legal...
 I take it back.
 I take it back!
 Okay.
 Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
 Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
 Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
 No, my all time favorite!
 All time favorite.
 You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends.
 You should tell him.
 Dwight.
 Kay.
 Hey!
 Um... Oscars kind of cute.
 Ooh, Toby!
 I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
 Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
  You wanted me?
  Papier-mache?
 Hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Why did you put it off until Halloween?
 I think its gonna put a damper on the party a little.
 So its a man?
 I just answer the phone.
 Youre costume is fantastic!
 Oh no, dont, dont, dont, dont.  Aah!  Okay...
 Okay, greatest strength.
 A dog-like obedience to authority
 But that doesnt sound good.
 Hes a gun nut.
 No, I made brownies.
 ... What?
 I made brownies.
 Im guessing Angelas the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
  Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
 Jim is really talented. And he should be the one whos getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
  Dont take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
 Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And its definitely a step up. And a challenge.
 Jim...
 What happened?
 Oh. That was like crazy. Cause I was...
 Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, Im sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
 I dont really have any control over that Stanley.
 Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and thats today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
 Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
 Its just last year you...
 Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
  Well, is that really a priority?
  Youre major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
 I am just following the website.
 Yes, you have very nice teeth.
 Could you practice on the forms?
 I dont know.
 French Onion?
 Ok.
 I just have a quick question.
 No, its not that. Um, I was just wondering, since Im probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
 Hes a purple belt. Thats really high.
 Its just out there, you...
 Yeah.
 What?
 Well, look closer.
 Once point for me.
 Oh, youre dead.
 Hey, put me down. Put me down.  Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
 Yeah, you too.
 The shipping place closes in a half hour.
 Wait, are those Michaels Levis?
 Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and Im not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know thats why he started casual Fridays.
  Ill take those. Thanks.
 What is going on?
 Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
 No, they had to come back for me.
 Umm... it was not that long ago.
 Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
  Ok, you want me to read em?
 Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
 When-
 Ok.  Theres a transcript between a naval ship-
 Sure.  Theres a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
 It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
 Of the FBI.
 What is that?
 Hey, uh, I have to work late.
 Heres what we think happened.  Michaels sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot whos causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesnt work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
 Yeah.
 For the bugs.
 Yes... nice!  I cant remember the last time someone made me dinner.
 What are you going to do with your time off?
  You have new music?
 What!?
 Oh, I dont know...  Oh my God.  This is Jans cell.
 Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh, really?
 Why might some say that?
 Uh hmm.
 We didnt dance.
 Swaying isnt dancing.
 I have some faxes to get out.
 Its performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I dont really know what to expect.
 Thank you.
 Oh, no.
 Uh, just off the top... I think shell be here this afternoon.
 She missed you.
 I have one idea of what it means.
 Well I dont think youre gonna be very happy with this.
 Because shes conflicted.  She has to be professional, but shes fighting feelings... for you.
 Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
 Michael and Jan definitely made out.
 Maybe more.
 Oh, yea!
 Michael?
 Jans on the phone for you.
 Sorry.
 What suggestion box?
 Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
 Sure.
 Hey, Jim.
 Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night?
 Can you believe who Trump fired?
 You didnt see it?
 Michael, its time for the suggestion box meeting.
 You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
 Everyones waiting in the conference room.
 Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
 How do you come back from that?
 No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
 As a human being.
  Thank you.
  Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
 I know!
 Do you think that theyre like-
 No, right, no, no.
 Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
 Its like squishing a spider under a book.  Its gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that its really dead.  Sooo...  If you guys see anything... ?
 Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
 One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
 Ummmm...
 Hey, Angela-
 Hows it going?
 Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jims party tonight?
 No. I mean, I dont know, I dont think so.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 The professors would go to the parties?
  What?  Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
 Really? Thats great.
 Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
 Oh, no, he cant make it.
 No thanks.
 Hey.
 Definitely.
 Jims bedroom.
 Cool... This is your desk.
 Your home office?
 Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
 Ok, wait, so that would make me  like right here.
 And Dwight would be like-
 Umm,  yearbook!
  Ooooohhh no!
 You were so dorky!
 Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
 Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
 Thats ok.  Its ok.
 Oh, yeah I gave that up.
 Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
 Just because two people are hanging out, it doesnt mean that theyre together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
 You do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party.
 I think the tree looks nice.
  Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. Its awesome.
 Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
 Ill take the iPod.
 I want the iPod.
 Well, I mean, its an iPod. But ..
 Sorry, I ..
 Maybe because you hated her present so much.
 How much?
 I know. Its totally going to change the way I work out.
 So what are you going to get me instead?
  No, I was just checking out my present.
 I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
  Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
 Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
 Oh, my God! Its incredible.  Is this the Boggle timer?
 Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, its a pencil cup.
 Um, I dont think so, I just bought it.
 I love these.
 Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
 A ski mask and a swimsuit.
 And brush our teeth.
 How about the anchor?
 I think youre thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
 No, Im not going to do that.
 Hey, why dont we find like a quieter place to hang out?
 Its getting kind of rowdy down there.
 Sometimes I just dont get Roy.
 I mean, I dont know. So... whats it like dating a cheerleader?
 Im cold.
 Uh, Ive been engaged for three years, and theres no end in sight. So... you dont wanna ask my advice.
 No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
 No, thank you.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Michael, whats wrong?
 Ok, wait wait wait wait...
 Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
 Ok...
 Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
||
 Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
 Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
 Michael, why dont you call your girlfriend?
 What was that?!
 Ohhhhhh!
 Oh my gosh.
 Is he ok?
 You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
 No, I didnt mention that you cooked your foot.
 You didnt have any.
 And do my job?
 Its just that before, you said that you didnt want any special treatment.
 Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
 Youve seen one of these?
 Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  Im trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
 Really?
 Oh! Ha, haha.
 Pan?
 Oh, God.
  What.
 Tell me before I come there.
 No.
 No.
 Really?
 What?!
 That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!
 Oh God no, Dwight isnt my friend... Oh my God!  Dwights kind of my friend!
 No, hes actually been really nice and helpful.
 Wow...
 Dwight, you have your hand up.
 Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
 Get up, get up.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 I know.
 I just want to say goodbye ok?
 Yes, I know, but its gonna be different.
 Its just hard to explain.
 Oh my goodness!
 Come here.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
 I cant believe hes getting a CAT scan.
 Really? Michael went in with him?
 Wow.
 Ok, thats uh, good news  Uh, yeah, no Ill let you go.
 Ok. Bye.
 Hey, Oscar?
 I just wanted to let you that Dwights gonna be ok.  The doctor said theres a really simple treatment for a concussion, so hell probably even be back at work tomorrow.
 I just, uh, thought youd want to know that.
 Oh, I can not believe I fell for that.  Oh, my God.
 I bought my veil.
 Ummm...
 Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I dont know, like loose with big curls and...
 Thats a communal bowl.
 Sick, like lots of sniffling. I dont know.
 Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
 Ok, it was the second one.
 Nuh-uh.
 What did you guys talk about?
 I hate you.
 Hey.
 Did you find anything good in your desk?
 Score.
 Big day.
 Oh.
 Right.
 No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
 No, I mean, just cause we like got along so well.
 So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
 Mmm, hmm.
 Cool.
 Hey, heres your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
 Oh, no, thats, you dont have to.
 No, really, its okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
 Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
 Yep.
 Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
 Right.
 It was great.
 Mm-hm.
 Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
 What?
 I dont know.
  Oh... I dont know.
 No, I dont think its a bird.
 Open the door up!
 Thanks!
 A little.
||
 Youre gonna throw my things on the ground?
  ...back so soon.
 Yeah, right.
 Yeah, thats right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
  Are you kidding?
 Somebody did something bad to Michaels carpet. Maybe thats all we need to know.
 That doesnt seem fair.
 Whats our punishment?
  Hey, Jim.  Its Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michaels there and its horrible.  Anyway, Im bored.  Come back!
  Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I cant see Michaels head.  Its working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
   Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
  Ill transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what wouldve happened, so thank you.
  Hey, whats that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
  Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and Im not messing this up, so Ill see you tomorrow.
  Calling from my cell phone.  I dont know if you guys figured out who did that to Michaels carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
 Todays a women in the workplace thing. Jans coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I dont really know what. But Michaels not allowed in. She said that about five times.
 Jan.
 Michaels still at the door.
 Mmmhmm.
 I dont know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
 Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and Id still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
 Thanks.
 Well... I have a job right now, so I cant really take time off...
 Well... its just that the weekends arent good because, um...
 Hey.
 Hows it going down there?
 Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
 No.
 Almost.
 Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. Theres this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
 Um...
 Its really cool.
 Dreams are just that. Theyre dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. Its nice but... um... I dont know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
 How did you know?
 Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
 Roys right. Theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway.
 What? You have something you want to say?
 Oh, excuse me! Im fine with my choices!
 Yeah.
 Its impractical. Im not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they dont even make houses like that in Scranton. So, Im never going to... .
 I really like Valentines Day in this office. Its kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwights head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
  Phyllis.
 Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
 Thats OK.
 Guess what?
 Thats great.
 OH, Holy God!
 You cant fire me, Dwight, just cause Michaels not here.
 You need to get something for your girlfriend.
 Tightly wound?
 Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
 No, not like a ham. Its about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
 That you remember her.
 Yeah.
  Oscar.
  Join the club.
 Hey.
 I guess, yeah.
 Nothing, its just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
 I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping youd get me
 Heading out?
 Bye.
 Night Phyllis.
 Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
 Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
 Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... Ill uh show them to you later.
 Ok, cool.
 I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I dont want to offend... Angela... or someone.
 Mom, Im sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
 Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
 You mean Toastmasters?
 Yeah, the bride doesnt really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
 Roy has a connection. Its nicer than you think.
 Of course. Hes one of my closest friends.
 Maybe well use a DJ. Thats the one thing Roys in charge of for this wedding but all hes managed to do is set a date.
 Ryan, you should be more sensitive. Its obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
 Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
 Thats awesome. Where are you staying?
 When are you leaving?
 Oh.
 Oh yeah. Thats too bad.
 Its ok. I got it.
 Im looking forward to Take Your Daughter to Work day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because Im getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
 Oh, I have more.
 Oh, Michael. You cant be nasty today.  Cause of the...
 I reminded you last night.
 Dont you think you should say something?
 Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
 Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? Its actually pretty cool.
 I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
 That is!
 Hes not coming out. He wont pick up the phone.
 So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. Shes
 Mmhmm.
 Sure.
 Youre welcome.
 Its not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
 Really?
 Okay. Um... here it is. Dont put your fingers in there.  Cool huh?
 Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
 I know.
 I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.
 My theory is that...
 Happy birthday Michael.
 I said happy birthday.
 Ones good.
 Michael wants a strippergram?
 Michael, I have Jan on the line.
 I can sign for it.
 When does he hear?
 Ohh... poor Kevin.
 If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
 ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
 Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
 And his favorite lunch.
 You use fabric softener?
 No, I do.
  We should probably head back.
 You dare me? How old are you?
  Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
  Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
 Oh Im sorry. Im sorry.
 I hate you.
 No.
 Who is that?
 I got it.
 Michael?
 This is from all of us.
 Michaels birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I dont know... It was a good day.
  Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes hell look up at me from his desk and hell just be someone else. Like hell go um,  thats supposed to be Phyllis.  I cant do it as good as he can.
 He does everyone in the office.
 Jinx! Buy me a coke.
 No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.
 Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
 Sorry, thats not my problem.
 Hey guys, whats going on?
 Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.
 I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
 Uh, hmmm.
 Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
 What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just cant for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.
  Here.  Just buy it from me. I havent talked to you in hours and its been weird and I really want to know what the hells going on with Dwight.
 Hey.
 Ten minutes.
 No.
 Yeah?
 Oh, thanks!
 Uh...
 There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  its my wedding. And I dont want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
 Win!
 How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
 Win.
 Win
 Hey, Angela. I didnt have your zip code.
 Nice.
  Um... lets move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
 Wait, what did it say?
 I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And Ive been really nice to her... and I havent told anyone. And what the hell?!
  Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
 I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
 I cant believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
 Dont take her side.
 I dont know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
 Yeah.
 Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
  I am.  Its about the Save The Date.
 What?!
 Okay.
 Its a nice tux.
 Come on, itll be fun, and besides, Im a roulette expert.
 No, they stopped making that show.
 No, thats Afghan.
 Oh, nothing.
 Theyre wedding bands.
 Roy was supposed to pick the band, but hes concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
 Theres a KISS cover band in here.
 Im pretty happy these days. Im getting married soon and Im getting along with everybody at work.
 I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
 Have three stages, yeah.
 Oh.
 Oh, wait. Thats Kevin. On the drums.
 On the drums! On the drums!
 Oh, my...
 No! No!
 No, come back! No, no, no!
 Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
  Michael, Carol Stills for you.
 Carol Stills.
 Your realtor.
 Sometimes I dont put Michael through until hes already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
 Carol, youre on with Michael.
 Michael, Jans on line two.
 Its still me. Uh, Jan, heres Michael.
  Oh, my God!
 "Yeah, right," what?
  I have good cards.
 Mhmm, And Im gonna take you all-in.
 Straight.
 Its okay. Ill see you at home.
 Okay.
 Bye! Hey.
 Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
 About when you want to give me more of your money?
 Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. Im feeling kind of good tonight.
 What?
 What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
 Well, I um... I... I cant.
