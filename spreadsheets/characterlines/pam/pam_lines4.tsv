 It was for a video.
 A celebrity sex tape.
 Not relevant.
 Not relevant.
 It all happened so fast.
 Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. Its really nice to be good friends again.
 And Sunday Im thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
 Cool.
 Well have fun with that.
 Thank God you were there.
 Oh, Michael.
 Hey guys, were all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And were kicking in $5 for flowers.
 No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
 Yeah, I havent asked him yet.
 I was planning on it.
 Angela?
  Are you coming?
 Cant your other cats keep her company.
 Angela, youre the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldnt even be planning this, its your job.
 OK, were leaving for the hospital at 1.
 I can take 3 people.
 Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and well sign it outside her room.
 Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
 I...
 I was thinking that we...
 But...
 Michael! Michael!
  Its gonna be OK.
 Michael, Angelas cat died.
 Thats cool.
 Oh me too.
  Same religion.
 I can help you with that.
  I told you Im not dating anyone. And even if I was, I dont think its anyones business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when its for real, the last person Im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.  Trust me, when I fall in love, youll know.
 Michael Scotts Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
 Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
 Whats wrong?
 Hmm...
 Ah.
 Angela, Im sorry.
 Im more of a dog person.
 Well Im gonna start fast.
 Then Im gonna run fast in the middle.
 Then Im gonna end fast.
 Cause theyre just stupid.
 Yeah... That was um...
 Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
 ... Were dating.
 Ah, yeah. We havent told anybody, but its going really great.  Right?
 Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, thats over 25% of our funds?
 Giant check it is.
 Not well. A doctor wont come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
 And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
 I dont think so.
 Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.
 Hey.
 Oh my God.
 You said come in!
 Oh my God.
 So I closed the door but the image of his...
 ... dangling participle...
 ... still burned in my eyes.
  Come in.
 Yes. Or come in.
 On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
 Theyre so not.
 I didnt see where it started but I saw where it ended.
 They say if youre nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
 What? Look, no it was not...
 Yeah.  Oh were in last place.
 Darn it.
 I dont know Im really committed to winning.
 Mmm... Yes.
 Yeah.
  You like it? Its kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
 Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
 Im still having a nice day.
 Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
 And Michael, you dont have rabies. And chances are youre not going to get it anytime soon. So... you dont really have to think about it too much.
 Yeah, but theres other, better people out there who are helping.
 I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
 Hey.
 I gotcha one.
 Yeah.
 No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?
 Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
 Phones ringing.
  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
 You might want to trim it a little.
 Yeah, he is.
 Hey Toby.
 Well, I dont wanna speak for Jim, but, its like pretty official.
 OK.
  Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
 Yeah.
 No..
 No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque.
 You didnt say anything to me?
 Can you believe that...
 OK.
 Hi.
 In his office. You can go right in.
 Michael told us to wait in here. We dont know why.
 Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
 Oh.
 I think that I should help him get home.
 Hi.
 Nice to meet you.
 Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  Youre going to violate your own PDA memo.
 Hey.
 Its funny you bring that up because yes it is.
 I think... I mean, I dont know what it is but...
 I now find you repulsive.
 Eh...
 OK.
 Uh totally.
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
 OK.
 Yeah, Im gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I dont know what Im talking about but Im excited.
 So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? Id love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
 Thanks.
 Thatd be great.
 Oh... is it...
 No...
 Um...
 Im uh, Im dating Jim.
 Were together.
 Yeah, great.
 OK great!
 Great.
 Hey.
 I gotcha one.
 Yeah.
 No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?
 Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
 Phones ringing.

 Were together.
 Yeah, great.
 OK great!
 Great.
  I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didnt see it?  Did Jim say that I didnt see it? I saw it!
  Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
 He does.
  Dwight mercy killed Angelas cat.  Its very complicated.  Its caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
  Hes going through a break-up.
  What kind of prank are you thinking?
  Yes its too tight.
  Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
  Uh, just one second.  Were in a meeting and Ill see if hes available.  Its Jan.
  One of the tickets is for him.
  I won.
  Tie goes to the girlfriend.
  Heres a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why dont you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
  Hello.
  Um... uh... Ill get back to you.
 The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
 I said it normal.
 Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
 Im all over it.
 Yeah, enjoy this moment, because youre never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
 You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and theres no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt youre about to eat has expired.
 Yep.
 Nope.
 Ah-ha.
 Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
 Hes a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldnt be surprised that hes identified with her character.
 A suit?
 Like the main company number? Because Im gonna have to call information.
 You finished the movie.
 No. Go ahead.
 Mo Chuisle. Hes watching Million Dollar Baby... Hes gonna try to kill me.
  Michael, its Ryan for you.
 Hello, Im looking for a room.
 It says here you cater to the eldery.
 Trip Advsior.
 Two?
 Shoot!
 We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
 You wouldnt understand, Jim. Its a secret.
 The Beets Motel.
 Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
 I dont know!
 Oh my gosh.
 What are the themes?
 Irrigation.
 What?
 Yeah. Coward.
  Oh my God. What century is this?
  Ugh, your turn.
 Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
 Its whom when its the object of a sentence, and who when its the subject.
 How did he use it again?
 Whats up?
 Youre being gross.
 What moves?
 I cant believe thats not working.
 Um, I dont know if I really see you two together.
 Shes very religious.
 Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
 Thats right, you did.
 Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldnt do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
 Michael.
 Whats going on, why do you have a second job?
 Doesnt Jan have money?
 Man, Angela really had a hold on him.   Angela.
 We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
 Table making never seemed so possible.
 The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
 We really did.  It was fun.
 Dwight.
 Hey, I was thinking about dinner---
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Jims just really passionate about Italian food.
 Im taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
 No talk, Im animating.
 Are you serious?
 Oh my God, hes really in pain.
 Whos that?
 He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
 Right... youre a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
 You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
 No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
 Oh boy.
 Maybe, but its not good enough for me yet.
 No no, you can go home. Im good.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
 Thank you.
 I worked until about 245 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
  Yes?
 Certainly.  Okay, clear.
 Thanks.
 Oscar, did you bring it?
 Okay, well I have the tablecloth, dont forget the flatware.
 Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but were always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  Its very exclusive.
 Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
 Some people.
 I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
||
 Its Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
 And spend time with George Emerson.  Thats what I would do.  I mean its the best male protagonist weve read, right?
 Uh, Im sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
 I think its interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion.  And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucys torn between these two things.  Shes torn between passion and convention.
 It just-   To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
 Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
 Very brave choice also, I thought.
 Why dont you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
 Im so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
||

 Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasnt invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
 Did you sleep in cabins?
 Who went?
 Do you want me to ask where youre going?
 Great.
 Oh.
 Wow! Youre shaking things up a bit, huh?
 Do you think its a good idea?
  Hmm.
 Wow! That was easy.
  Conference room?
 Every time Michaels in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him whos on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesnt get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
 The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
 Hi, Kelly.
 I dont wanna guess.
 Jim. Can I see you for a second?
 Okay, its not regulation size, but itll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
 Please? Kellys trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
 Sorta, yes.
 Okay.
 Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
 He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
 Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. Hes in the conference room.
  Hows it going?
 Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
 Ill make the call.
  Yes! Way to go.  See that?
 You know what? Im sick of this! Lets go, you and me!
 Lets go. Pick up a paddle.
 I am.
 In my sleep.
 O.   P.
 We got you this.
 Its really nice.
 Uh-huh.
 So you have an office and a workspace?
 What a cute bench.
 Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didnt have audio for a week.
 Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
 Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 400?
  I dont care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
 Montana.
 Joe Montana!
 Why didnt you just say 49ers quarterback?
 Oh okay.
 Oh Jim, I dont think youre going to abandon this party here all by itself.
 You can buy new stuff but you cant buy a new party.
  Oh, thank you.
 Is there more wine in the kitchen?
 No, yeah. What?
 Oh, are you joking?
 I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
  Awesome.
  Like... like what?
 I know Jan didnt poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldnt it be me? Michaels former lover?
 And now you guys are dating?
  Flooded.
  This is the best burger Ive ever had, babe.
 Hmm?
  One night...
 W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
 Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
 Nature.
 Some of us like the walk more than others.
  Did you pick a new chair? Its been awhile.
 But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
 Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldnt care, but he promised me his old one. Its way better. Its one of these.  I really want it.
 Her?
 The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
 Or in a great chair.
 I definitely remember your dinner party.
 Actually, I put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair.
  No, he hasnt picked one yet.
  Who are you putting down?
 Who is it?
 Yeah, whatever.   Give it to me. Give it to me.
 OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
 No, I mean it.  Shes really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.
 Im setting Michael up with my land lady. Shes really sweet and... whatever, I just cant take Michael like this.
 Shes sweet and cute. I thought youd get along.
 I know.
 Oh I dont care, I didnt really like that place that much anyway. Ill just move.
 Yeah, maybe Ill just move in with my boyfriend cause hes kind of a slob, too.
 No, I umm, well Im not gonna, Im, Im not gonna move in with anyone unless Im engaged.
 Hmm, I dont, know...
 Oh, right now?
 OK, so then, when?
 Oh, right, yeah.
 Ohh kay.
 Ive been warned.
 Nice job.
 I dont know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one...
  I hate you.
 Oh, oh.
 How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
 Whats wrong Michael?
 You do.
 We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
 No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
 You cant, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
 There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If Im dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."
 I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
 Aw! Thats great Toby.
 Toby, youre the best.
 Phyllis.
 I know how to throw a football.
 Actually, its kind of too bad were not coming into work tomorrow.
 I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday.
 Michael we dont know what youre talking about...
 Shes talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
  Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friends house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
 I dont have my contacts...
 Dont, dont--
 If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
 Oh, thanks.
 Oh, okay...
 I should probably get back to...
 Entering the....
 No.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.
 Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
 Because youre very important?
 What does that mean?
 I cant find my glasses.
 Okay, okay.
  I think you look nice.
 So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didnt have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didnt have to play basketball. Those were the days!
  Um, thats all we brought.
 Theres some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
  Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
 This is Michael, my boss.  Justin.
 Hes nice and he seems interested.
 I only brought the one.
 Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Dont worry, its just allergies." Do you remember that?
 Okay. Ill go look for another one.
 My old art room.  Oh, maybe its still here!  No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
 A piece of paper.
 Well I think theyll get the spirit of it.
 Are you serious?
 Okay.
 Just checking in, hows it going?
 I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
 Talk to you later?
 Excuse me.
  Beers? You closed it?
 Yes! Oh!  Um, congratulations to you, sir.
 Well done.
 Hi.
 I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
 Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
 I can do that.
 I dont know any of those.
 New York or Philadelphia.
 All right. Cool, well... thanks.
 And uh, Ill look into those.
 New York or Philadelphia.
 Okay.
 Thanks.
 Hey, is this Dwight?
 Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
 Have you?
 Dwight?
 Im confused...
 Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans funeral?
 So how much antigravity potion do you want?
 Hi, can I help you?
 Hey.
 Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
 Oh, thank you! I dont know why I doubted it, because Im so clearly awesome!
 I dont know, I didnt read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
 So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
 Yeah, it sucks, but itll be great.
 Ohh...
 I wouldnt go if things werent so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldnt go then either. So, the timings perfect... And that is the first time Ive ever used the word "perfect" in here!
 Do you like it? Its a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
 Well I was taking the picture.
 Sure, do you have a camera here?
 Okay...
  Did you need me to take notes?
 Okay.
 Toby, why dont you open your present?
 Michael...
 So what is your gift?
 What is it?
 Your watch?
 I just knew.
 Is that the police?
 Absolutely.
 Wow. Look at our parking lot.
 Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isnt he? No, hes not... Is he?
  Yay, Phyllis!
 Song parody writer.
 I like that one.
 I like that one.
 Im gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
 Dont tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
 Oh look, theyre starting.
 Oh, yeah, um...
 Sure. Meredith, do you mind?
 I dont know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
