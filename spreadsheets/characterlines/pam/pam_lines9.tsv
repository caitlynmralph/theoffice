 For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
 Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
  Yes, Jims friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
 And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
 He said if it takes off hes gonna buy us a new car.
 And that was our summer.
 Dont you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
 Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I dont think anythings gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids theres just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
 Dwight!
  What are you doing?
 I will?
 Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
 No.
 Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
 Exactly the way it is.
 Yes, and theres nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
 Find someone else, I dont know. Ask Phyllis.
 You ready?
 Kay.
  The buildings custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, were living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
 Well, it doesnt spin. Well just move the wheel one notch each morning and you see what chore you get that day.
 No, Im familiar with spinning. Its just that wouldnt work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
  â€˜Kay.
 Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
 I dont think you guys understand why were doing this. Its-
 Ive been through several rounds of development with the team and heres where we stand with the chore wheel.  Weve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; its more fun this way.
  The tiny wheel actually does have chores. Its so cute no one seems to mind.
  Toilets!
  Thanks, mom!
 Yeah. Im afraid hes only gonna have hot dogs.
 Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
 Think so.
  Thank you.
  Yes, thank you.
  Whos that?
  Ha-ha.
 No. Roy? No.
  We still surprise each other.
 You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
 Yes. But, what I didnt tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didnt go because it was-
 In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other?
 Tell me one thing about you I dont know.
 And you thought you guys were millionaires.
 Yes. But theres, wait, oh, theres a funny ending to that story. I cant remember.
 Thought you were millionaires, yeah. Thats funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
 Uh-huh.
 Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
 Johnny Depp.
 I think maybe there actually is something I dont know about Jim.
 OK. Well, heres something you dont know. A couple of weeks ago-
 I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didnt tell you because, I dont know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didnt know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought youd want to know.
 Yeah, I wouldve. What about you? Come on, theres gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just havent had the chance to tell me.
  Just tell me.
 Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Gricos at 730.
 Jims at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
 . Is everything okay?
 Great.
 Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
  Im sorry, Im leaving you alone for lunch.
 You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
 Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
 Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
 What?
 Sure.
 So hes not related to Michelle Obama?
||
 Nellies pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
||
 Yeahâ€”turn signal. Its exciting to be painting againâ€”those are the wipers. Soâ€”theâ€”itsâ€”just. There you go! Yeah.   Yeah, things get so busy with the kidsâ€”red lightâ€”that its nice to have that creative outletâ€”red light! Red light! Red! Red!
 Well, since were stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angelas baby.
 Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
  Thank you.
 Week off. Thatd be great.
 Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
 A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
 Yeah, OK then.
 Whats this?
 Its OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
 Oh my god! Ah!
 You know what? Its fine, its fine. Let me just...its fine.
 Oh! Yes!
 My name is Pam.
 I like to paint.
 You think youre better?
 Oh no you aint!
 Hey, wheres Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
 No, I mean hes sulking. Thats not like him.
 Then why isnt he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
 Hey honey, I dont think we should push him.
 Phyllis! Thats not safe.
  Go up and check on him. Hes upset.
 Please? Just make sure hes OK?
 Oh!  Hey! Howd it go?
 Yeah?
 You feel OK now?
 Well, actually, rhubarb is-
 the one pie that I dont.
 Oh my god. Im getting so stuffed.
 You did it.
 Role call.
 Hey.
 I am Dr. Cinderella.
 Im an oncologist and you are a dog.
 So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
 Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
 Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
 You were in an a capella group?
 Yeah. I mean, listen if were gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
 I kind of am. Its crazy.
 Okay.
 Okay I give up. What are you?
  Gross. I love it.
 Hey, howd it go?
 Did you end up investing?
 How much?
 About ten?
 Wow.
 Wow.
 No yeah. Yeah.
 So did everybody ...
 Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
 What?
 They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
 So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
 Talk about it now.
 Jim, that was most of our savings.
 We said some. We said â€˜some.
 We said part not all.
 Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
 No Im just, Im saying, what would happen if they didnt sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
 No! No, Im interested. I mean I think everybodys interested in why they have to sing it.
 Yeah, yeah, no, no. Its a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you cant do if you just keep singing â€˜Monster Mash.
 Andys family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
 The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way hes been handling it is just..so..
 Right?
  Oh, great! Yeah, um, Ill get right back to you.  Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
 Nope, thats Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?
  Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interviews off. Theyre opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
 Hes gonna be disappointed.
  Please hold for Ms. Black.
  Good afternoon Iris, its a pleasure.
 No the papers not toxic.
 Unless its exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
 Andy.
 Can you go instead?
 Youve got this Schrute.
 Oh, Ill be the buyer.
 Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
 Okay, lets stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
 Okay, when youre selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
 Okay, well you have to show us.
 Huh.  Uh huh.
 A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
 Nellie, why dont you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that youre listening.
 Ten years ago, I didnt care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now Im like, that poor gimp is somebodys child.
 You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
 Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
 Okay, so, when youre selling to this woman, just imagine that shes that nice, reasonable barber.
 Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
 Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
 Oh, great. Oh, Im sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we dont have it.
 Okay, great.
 Oh my God. Its Jan.
 Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
 Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
 Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! Its so great to see you.
 What?
 Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
 So this was all just a trick. You dont really have any business to give?
 But not to us.
 You did good, Dwight. Its okay. I mean, seriously, Jans not normal. Lets just go. Shes not going to sell to us.
 What?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
 Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
 And it is so cute how she signs her name.
 Oh, okay. Its just thats how Cece does it with the backwards â€˜Es.
 Oh, actually she can.
 Of course.
 Um... â€œAâ€... â€œXâ€? I dont -- you got me.
  Im so sorry. I hate this. Youre better.
 Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
 Oh, my God.
 Okay, you do not have to do this.
 Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
 Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
 Thats a license number?
 Oh. Why me?
 These are my painting clothes.I think Im gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
 Are you avoiding your phone call?
 Last week Jim wasnt there, and they named the company Athlead.
 Tell them your opening line.
 I think its good. He likes fishing.
  I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. Its just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, Im gonna limit myself to one shrub.
 Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
 Its probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
 I could get us a complaint.
 No, I wouldnt. I cant even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. Id like to try.
  Hello, this is Pam Halpert. Im calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, â€œHey, kool-aid.â€ Yeah, your mamas fat. This is Pam Halpert.
 Basically I couldnt tell, but I think...
 I-- I thought they were confused at least...
 I did not know that.
 Im so sorry.
 If youre an artist, you have to be okay with the idea Â that you cant please everybody all the time.
 Shut up, Hide! Â I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? Im okay with that.
 Im sure its fine. its a blue shirt.
 Im on it.
 Were the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwights party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe its not. Maybe its going to be great. And if its great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
 Yes! Phyllis!
 What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
  The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that were all going to do Dwights Christmas.
 Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
 And that is...
 That there are no rules.
 Youre welcome.
 What is it?  Dont touch it.
 Oh!
 I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
 And the fear.
 Wow.
  Mouse trap.
 Well...this is it.
 Shut up. Im trying to be serious.
 I cant believe this is actually happening.
 Okay.  Good luck. Youre gonna be great.
 Okay.
 Love you.
 Whats going on?
 What?
 Jims been spending a few days a week in Philly and Im not gonna lie, its been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. Im exhausted. But dont tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and hes doing it all for the family.
 Great. Everythings great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
 Oh, call me later!
 Good luck!
 Love you.
 Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
 He didnt leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please?
 Im sure shes just confused. People scratch their heads when theyre confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
 Dwight, relax. Its just lice. Maybe, possibly.
 Stop that!
 Alright, lets give her a break. We dont know for sure this is Merediths fault.
 No! How? Im so clean!
 Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
 Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So lets not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, Ill tell her it was me.
 Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
 Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
 Oh stop! I am so sorry!
 Nothing.
 I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, well have a few laughs. Theres a right way to do this.
 Shes right, it works. I would imagine.
 Oh! Uh, uh Ill go.
  No, no, its not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while Im at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
 Okay.
 Oh, no everythings great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
 Hes really making you work for it, huh?
 Great. I am killing it over here.  Jim, I gotta go.
 Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
  Creed, Im all done. My turn.
 Well, wait.
   Hello?
 What, no. That cant...I dont...
 You guys, I am so sorry! Its just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
 Is there a volume knob on that thing?
 Meredith, I am so sorry.
 I meant to say something earlier. I just...
 Hey honey, its me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
 Im just gonna go home. My moms been watching the kids all day.
 Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
 Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
 I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
 Get it, girl!
  This ones for all you ladies out there.
 Not yet.
 Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
 Ha ha. Thatd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get What do you get? Oh my god! Why didnt I think of this? Andys not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, Im expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
 A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everythings in order.
  Okay, see you later.
 You ready for your interview?
 Well, you shouldnt be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
 Really, you cant be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but hes basically Gumby with hair.
 Good!
 I just wanted to see you!
 Wow, this place is so great. I had no idea â€“ on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
 Sure, no problem.
 Thats sweet that he talks about me.
 Well, thats funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
 Theyre the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. Its like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I dont blame Cece.
 Say they dont hire you. Its not like youre out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
 Right? Thank you! Its just Philly. Everyones acting like its New York or Paris or London.
 Not us.
 Congratulations.
 I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
 No, Im not upset. Im really excited for Darryl Maybe Im a little disappointed that well be losing him.
  Everybody dance now
  Hey What happened here?
 Are the pens here?
  Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
 You dont remember?
  Theres nothing down here.
 Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
 Oh, no, Kevin, its not a joke. Angelas husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
 Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now Im just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, lets be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
 Well, Im heading out to Ceces dance recital.
 Hey, Cece, Daddys gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
 Lets call him.
 Hey, Hon, are you close?
 What?
 Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you werent gonna make it.
 Of course.
 Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
 I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, were getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, â€œBye, Daddy.â€
 Oh, Im sorry. Sorry.
  Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God!
  Um, Im sorry. I have to go. My daughters a ladybug. I know that doesnt make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
 Shh! Kids are dancing.
  Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
 Anyone want to see the video from Ceces recital?
 All right, you dont have to.
 Okay.
 Wait. What?
  Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
 Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
 Well, it was an important phone call.
 I havent told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, hes always like, â€œBeesly!â€ I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- â€œBeesly!â€
 Night
 Night, Creed.
 Hey.
 So, hows it going?
 Im so sorry.
  Oh, Im sorry. I feel like youve already been working insanely hard.
 Um, actually, funny story -- I didnt get it. I shouldnt have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
 No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
 Yeah, okay, Im sorry. Im sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
 Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
 I dont know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
 You know what? I-- I-- I dont think you want to start a conversation with me about whats fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
 I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
 Yep.
 Yep. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 Bye.
 What am I doing wrong, Brian?
||
 Its getting tougher. I just didnt know that it was gonna be this hard.
 Thank you.
 Hey Brian, you got a sec?
 I feel awful.
 Well, thanks for being a good friend.
 Yeah, mostly.
 Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
 Okay. Thank you.
 When are you talking to David Wallace?
 Too late. My hopes are up.
  Its fine. Its just a seating arrangement. Doesnt matter.
 Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
 Hey, Im the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jims away. Im in a position where Im rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
 Hide, theyre giving out jobs upstairs. Why dont you go up and get one?
 Yeah.
 Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
 Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
 Of course.
 Okay.
 Bye.
 Im good.
 Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
 Us.
 Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ill distract him, you take that.
||
 No, Dwight!
 Hey Brian, you got a sec?
 I feel awful.
 Well, thanks for being a good friend.
 Yeah, mostly.
 Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
 Okay. Thank you.
 When are you talking to David Wallace?
 Too late. My hopes are up.

 Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
 Us.
 Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ill distract him, you take that.
||
 No, Dwight!
 Ive really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because hes in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. Im usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I dont know, this time I feel like its, um, its really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? Youve gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way!
  Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I dont know everybodys name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. Its my choice.
 I dont demand justice often. Im not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Vals no help. Andys gone. Jims out. I just feel like Im on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
  Conference room. Everybody. Now!
 Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... Thats gonna be revealed once were in the conference room for the meeting.
 Yeah.
  I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
 Yeah, but this is different.
 I dont think so, but they put paint where I didnt want paint. So...
 Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
 Yes. Thank you. Lets answer that question.
 What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
 Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
  No, no. Come on, guys. Dont go.
 You will?
 Thank you.
 Yeah?
 Great.
 I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, Im pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
 We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
 See, I feel bad about that.
  Tell us who defaced the mural!
 All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
  Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if Ive done anything to offend you. Im sure it isnt easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
 Well, I didnt think that butt was funny.
 What was that?
 Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
 That sucked. He didnt apologize. Theres no talking to that guy.
 We should just take him down.
 Im saying we should go scorched earth on that guys face.
 Yes!
 Yes!
 We need an infiltrator.
 Clark?
 Shh, shh.
 Shh. Remember your lines.
  Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
 OK. What does he like? Whats important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
 Yeah, something like that.
 Oh, great!  His truck!
 OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
 Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on.
 Im done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
 Aw, Dwight. Thats really sweet.
 Oh, no. Um, I, Im embarrassed. Its stupid.
 Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
 Yeah. I feel better.
 I know. You miss Angela, dont you?
 I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. Its gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
No, you had no right!
 So? You started it!
 Whoa.
 Well, Im gonna say something to the producers.
 You shouldnt be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
 Forget about my mural. Its stupid.
 Its crazy. Brian, Im so sorry.
 Thanks, Brian.
  Hey. I feel so lucky were in the same city for Valentines Day.
  Alakazam!
 And, poof! He disappears.
  These are gross.
 Oh, hey, dont fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
 Its with Brian and Alyssa.
 I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
 That sounds nice.
 Sorry were late.
 Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
 Hes on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
 Yeah.
 Well, my dad cant hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
 Wheres Alyssa?
 Oh.
  Yeah.
 OK, I can tell youre mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I dont know, tell me why?
 I didnt tell you about the crying because I didnt want you to know how upset I was. Because it wouldve stressed you out and youre always saying how much you dont want more stress.
 Its not Brians fault.
 OK.
 Oh?
 Are you sure?
  Yeah.
 OK.
  Wow. I didnt know you kept this.
 Thank you.
 I dont think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
 Yeah, I do.
 He sounds like a wounded animal.
 Ok.
  Oh thats mine! Um, Ill just, Ill get it out of the way for you.
 Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. Its um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  Im sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
 Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
  hello!
 Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
 Ok
  Whats that? Is that a-
 How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
 Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
 Thanks.
 Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
 Ha ha.
 Bye.
 Hello.
 Hi, Pam, hello.
 Im Pam Halpert.
 Oh my god. Hes Michael Scott.
  Oh my god.
 Yeah, Ive seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but Ive actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
 Oh, cause it was upside down.
 So um-
 Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
 Yes.
 Two children, yes.
 I am not pr-
 Pregnant, no.
 Wow.
 Im sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
 So, kinda like a receptionist.
 Yes.
 I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I cant.
  hey!
 Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
 Eight? Really?
 Sure. I mean, its Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. Ill see you at eight.
 Love you.
 Hello?
 Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
 Oh, Jim I should have told you I didnt get the job.
 Oh, yeah. Im more than alright. Theres just nothing to celebrate.
  Youre very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
 So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
 Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
 Guess what poster he had on his wall?
 MmMm.
 MmMm. Youre getting colder.
  No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
 I dont know, but its interesting right?
 He said he cant help but tear up when he looks at it. Its like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
 Mmhm.
 I dont know.
 I know. Its just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I dont know, I dont know if I want, um, I dont know if I want this.
 Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
 Oh, Dwight. Im so sorry. Were you guys close?
  bad.
 Todd, youre just saying insults in the form of an apology.
 I think its called Nibbles.
 Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Dont eat the cupcake.
 I dont think we should eat Packers cupcakes. We cant give him the satisfaction.
 We cant let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
 Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
 So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
 Kevin, um, lets think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
 Yes. He was a good spy.
 Guys, Im proud of us. I think we did the right thing.  Hey!
  Wait!
 No, no. Its the principle of the thing.
 Good morning, Erin.
 Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesnt know, its OK.
 Phyllis!
 No!
 Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
 Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
 But, Kevin thats...
 Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately shes been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you dont know what it is, its a book about um...
 Yeah.
 Be careful. I pulled my moms dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
 Shes listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
  Cici has been calling me Pamela. Like four times this week.
 I wonder if shell start calling you Jim.
  Um.
 Youre- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
 Oh, oh OK.
  Um, Ok. Well?
 Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
 Ok.
 Bye.
 Uh huh.
 It wasnt so bad.
 Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
 Oh my god!
 Brian?
 Yeah, I guess I could.
 Hey!
 Hi, um. Im sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
 Oh my gosh, please, dont.
 Sure, yeah. Yeah.
 OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view.
 Oh, thank you.
 Cheers.
 So..
 Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
 Yeah. Its kinda crazy.
 See all this like old stuff, like um, theres that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
 Yeah, wasnt that neat?
 Yeah, and theres this one when we were listening to music and its like, its like w were in love and we didnt even know we were in love and its...but- Do you think Jims changed?
 Im sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
 I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like hes- I just feel like...hes so into his work right now and....I dont know, am I crazy?
 Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and theyre kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
 You know, stuff people didnt intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
 How much stuff you got.
 Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
 So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
 Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
 No I think you explained it.
 I hope you got sound on everything. Id love a DVD of that.
 Well, we wont be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Â   I wish.
 Oh, nothing that exciting.
 Hmm.
 You know, Jims kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
 I mean, weve having issues. It cant hurt to talk about them, right?
 He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, heÂ shouldntÂ be rewarded for that.
 I feel like hes always making these decisions for the family, and then Im left playing catch-up.
 Im sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I dont want him to do it anymore, and I dont want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
 I didnt see you! You should have yelled â€œCrossing!â€
 Ok, so is that my spot?
 Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
 So, we had couples therapy.
 And we have homework.
 And were also supposed to speak our truths.
 Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldnt have had this opportunity for couples therapy.
 Hey!
 Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
 Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  Theres a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
 Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
 I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
 Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-
 Uh, to speak my truth, Id appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice.
 Really? Ive been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? Thats really your truth?
 Were not high.
 I wish wed started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
 Ok.
 Jim!
 Alright, have a good trip.
 Bye.
 I love you.
 Its great.
 The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
 Nice morning, too.
 Wow.
 its okay. You can sit in the annex.
 Ill come visit you.
 Oh, Andy.
 Yes. Yeah.
 Oh, boy. Umâ€”
 I could give you some beginner stickies?
 Here you go.
 Mm-hmm.
 Its all yours.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 Um, I have a question.
 Oh, I had a question.
 I did!
 Super important.
 Okay.
 All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
 I dont know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
 Exactly.
 Im back. Oh, hey, look, and now its like a double date.
 Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
 Oh, well, Thursdays tough, because ofâ€”
 They are.
 Whats going on?
  Congratulations, Dwight.
 Its nice to have you back.
 Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
 Is that them again?
 Maybe you should call back?
 When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, hes giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, hes certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
 Question.
 We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as theyre delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, â€œNice jugsâ€?
 What are you so excited about?
 What are you up to?
 Nice.
 Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
 Darryl, hey.
 Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
 Aha. Hows Athlead?
 Wow.
 He says he doesnt want to.
 Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
 Thats what he says.
 Hey.
 Are you happy?
 No, I know that youre, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
 And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
 What about five years from now?
 Because Im so glad youre back, baby, but Im justâ€”I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like youre giving up so much.
 Okay.
 I kind of forced you to do it.
 Yes, I did.
 Im afraid that youre gonna resent me and Im afraid thatâ€”
 This is not enough for you and Im afraid that Im not enough for you.
 He does have a gift.
 What is this?
 Go ahead.
 Yeah.
 Whats that?
 Thank you.
 What? Dwight, you cant do that.
 Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyones ever been fired, Tobys blocked it, so
  Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
 I think she looks good. Now that shes wearing sports bras, we dont see her boobs as much.
  Darryl! Andy!
 Were fine. Yeah.  And Im sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldnt you be?
 Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. Hows the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
 Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
 Oh, boy.
 Wait, wait. What?
 Uh, that seems inappropriate.
 Whoo-hoogo, Merediths stripper son.
 No, no, Im fine.
 Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I dont know. Im working on something.
  Im sorry. Is there a question?
 Oh, um, well, you know, I I just I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if youd been filmed for nine years of your life, thered be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
 Listen, um I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didnt want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because hes shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now its better than a fairy tale. Its like a long book that you never want to end.  And youre fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
 Yeah, like Harry Potter.
 Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
 Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
  Oh, my gosh, its choreographed!
 He just so happy to have a family plan.
 Is it me? Is it Nellie?
 I need to get out of this dress.
   Why are you still here?
 Okay, Okay. Um so this past year has been really great, and youve been great and I just I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldnt be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
 About 2 months
 Yeah.
 Well, you you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
 Austin? Maybe.
 Im doing it for us.
 Hold on a second.  Wait, what did you just say?
 I wanna do this.
 I really want to do this!
 Were so excited.
 Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that Ive painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead!
 Everyone, Lets take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I justI kind of meant just everybody from the office.
 Okay.
  Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, Im sorry. Jim Halpert doesnt work here anymore.
 I didnt watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. Its just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. Itd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that Im a tragic person. Im really happy now. Butit would justjust make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself â€œbe strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isnt that long.â€
 What about the honeymoon?
 I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing
 And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. Well come back to visit. But I think its time for us to officially
 Thanks Dwight.
 I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in allI think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. Theres a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isnt that kind of the point?
