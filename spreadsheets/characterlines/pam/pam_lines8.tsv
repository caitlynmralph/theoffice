 I dont think I should.
 Right here. Little Michael Scott-
 Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
 Wait, when did we start calling it that-
 Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
 Because everything makes me cry, so whats the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
 Not enough though.
 Jim.
 If he comes out, distract him.
 He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
 Maybe its a list of people hes gonna fire.
 â€˜Scuse me?
 I love you so much.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Thats regular pizza.
  Oh, text from Jim. â€œThis is getting very weird. Will explain later.â€
  Oh, text from Kevin.
 I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, â€œWhos that receptionist? I like her.â€ Now Im just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and youre like, â€œOh, loser.â€
 Oh. Oh God.
 Yeah, Im fine.
 Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
 Okay, I know Ive been crying easily today, but-  I mean, thats just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe its stupid. No.  Its wonderful. Im gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
  Yeah, I hate those endings.
 Oh! Text from Jim. â€œThis is...â€ hmm.
 Kevin, do you feel OK?
 Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
 No he hasnt.
 Kevin, at most youre saving a microscopic amount of time.
 Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
 Its huge.  How much does it weigh?
 Erin, you dont need to call him that.
 Parenting? Yeah. This is Cicis favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
 I flipped through it.
 Of course.
 Yeah.
 That sounds nice.
 I do.
 Who talked to Maggie at Kaufmans?
 Wheres Angela?
 Ready!  â€œIm not as think as you drunk I am!â€
 Do Not Resuscitate
 Oh, and then this was Phylliss idea So nasty Phyllis!
 We were hoping you could do something like this
 Baby.
 Yes.
 Um, what should we talk about?
 Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
 Angela, thats pretty transparently me.
 You know its just herbal tea.
 Yeah. I think you should call social services.
 You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like were in this together.
 Fine.
 I dont like that clip.
 Whats that come to? Like, what did they each win?
 Awesome.
 And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
 I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
 And then every morning, Id walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
 And then my handsome husband...
 Would bring me a flavored coffee.
 Well in your fantasy were Stephen King characters.
 Oh, thank you.
 Wait, wait. Whats this?
 It says â€œLotto Poolâ€, right on top.
 Oh come on. You really think Im gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
 No.
 Uh, buying lottery tickets online.
 You came in at 1030 today, right?
 So. Ive been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
 And we move to the south of France. See? No, theres plenty of bicycling for you. I think thats where they do the Tour de France.
 Because Im never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
 We came to an agreement. Were going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
 Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
 Just like now.
 Oh..
 What are you gonna do?
 Andy, somebody defaced it.
 Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
 How is that better than a barbecue?
 Nope.
 Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
 Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but dont, dont say anything, okay? Its after my grandfather.
  Oh, wow. Funny. Its after my grandfather.
 I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
 What are they doing?
 Nice touch.
 Yeah, she just went down.
 Aww.
 Yes, after my grandfather.
 Well Im having my baby first, so thats that.
 You think your doctors going to give you a C-section at six months?
 Yeah.
  What are you doing?
 Oh.  Are you...
 Oh, Erin...
 Um, 2?
 No, I mean, youre doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
 Yeah.
 Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
 Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didnt believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, theres no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
 ...and he said, Thats what everyone sees, thats the Man In Black.
 Hey!
 What do you mean?
 I saw a ghost.
 It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
 I dont know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
  Pam Halpert.
 Is it called Ghostbusters?
 It didnt look like that.
 Ok fine Ill draw him.
 Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?
 Jim doesnt let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
 Really.
 Im not gonna freak her out, Jim.
 Im not gonna lie to her, either.
 Thank you.
 This isnt about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
 No, Creed.
 Lets see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means Ive heard Closing Time a hundred and five times.  Still dont know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
 I bet he went home.
 What are you doing?
 Uhm.
 Yeah, do you need a hand?
 Are you okay, Kevin?
 Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
 Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
 Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobodys nerfect, right?
 No. Its a jokey saying. Pobodys nerfect, like I cant even say those words right. Ha.
 You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
 Im thinking cow-
 Just dont talk about the email, okay? Hes gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
 Just trust me.
 I got this.
 Hahhh, thanks for everything.
  Dwight stopped the device!
 This could be real. Dwights pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
 You couldnt fix it.
 Yes you were.
 I dont think so, babe.
 Hey Cathy.
 Hows it going? Everything make sense?
 Great.
 Oh no, Im fine.
 Ok  Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
 Im training a temp to be my replacement while Im on maternity leave. Oh I shouldve mentioned Im pregnant. You probably didnt notice because its impossible to tell Im so small. But yeah Im pregnant.  Oh come on!
 You doubt it?
 Why do you doubt that shes single?
 Its going to be good to have someone hot at Pams desk huh?
 Im kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! Shes obviously super cute I get it. But Id like to point out theres 50 pounds more of me to love if thats your thing.
 Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
 Really well thank you all.
 Hey.
 Helen Mirren. Hot?
 Huh. What about Cathy?
 Yeah. Do you think shes hot?
 Im not asking if youre in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
 You dont find Cathy attractive?
 Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
 Yes, because shes hot, right?
 The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like youre a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly arent true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one whos telling me the truth.
 Dwight, am I hot right now?
 What about before? Was I attractive before?
 Hmm. I think Jims lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
 Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
 Yep, thats the Dwight I need.
 Okay.
 I think so. Okay.
 Well, what does that... is that... okay.
 Yep, good.
 Honesty is very important to me.
 Lets just see how we feel when we get there.
 Hmm.
 Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
 I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
 Mike Tibbets, really?
 Kelly, calm down.
 I dont think Jim cares about his hair.
 Jims on to me.
 Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
 Yep.
 No, Kelly, dont.
 Is he puffing out his chest?
 No. Maybe he just said something funny.
 I think hes just making her laugh.
 Whys he making her laugh so much?
 Why was he making her laugh so much?
 Oh, hey, Ill just be a second.
 Okay.
 Oscar, Cathy has a question!
  Yeah?
 Why wont you just admit that shes attractive? Its kind of annoying that you wont say it.
 Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe thats where we are now.
 Yeah, its nuts. But I dont know what else to do.
 This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
 Wait, thats it? Thats the question youre going to ask him?
 Ah, see, was that so hard?
 Really?
 Wait, what?
 Jim, you have high blood pressure.
 Doesnt your dad have high blood pressure?
 When was the last time you went to the doctor?
 Dwight, stop. Im not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
 Come on, lets go. I wanna call your doctor.
 Just go home. It doesnt matter.
  Im gonna do it.
 Oh! Im going into labor! Oh my goodness!
 I know its wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes its necessary.
  Im going into labor!
 Im going into labor!
 Im going into labor.
 Here we go!
 Okay.
 Oh! Oh!
 Im really in labor! This is happening!
 Oh!
 False alarm.
 Here. Like it?
 I cant get a fire pit. I have two babies.
 Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
 Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I dont like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
 Um, excuse me. Im gonna go to the bathroom.
 At this point, when youre this pregnant, its kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
 Hi. Wow, I really thought Id be more excited to be here.
 Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, its great to see you!
 Oh, hi Stanley.
 Jim.
 Hey.
 Hi everybody!
 How about a little visit?
 Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
 No, its the pacifiers turn.
  Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
 No, but that wouldve been a really good idea.
 No, she brought you drawings.
 She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No." Cece, do you want some broccoli?
 No. Its crazy.
 Shh.
 Oh, its okay, sweetie.
 Its okay, honey.  Its okay, its okay.
 Shh.
 Im looking, Im looking for the pacifier.
 Okay, were going.
 Shh, shh, shh.
 You want to grab her?
 Here we go, here we go.
 Jim.
 They dont hate you.
 When were you going go-karting with Darryl?
 Alright. Just dont worry, well figure this out.
 Ok, drama.
 Hey guys!
  Hi.
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
  Well, its not exactly a vacation.
 What?!
 Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevins allergic to walnuts. Youre allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
 Aw. Its OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
 When did you find time to do all this?
 Thank you.  Oh my gosh. Its really good.
 So you guys, you know whats an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
 ...we wanted to say thank you-
 Really?
 Ill fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
 Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
 Why? Does he think youre going to Florida?
 No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know its like wha-what?? Just do one.
 Well, lets hear it.
 I like it so far.
 Its perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
 Total golf text. Send it.
 Ok, read it back to me.
 Good. Doesnt sound pushy...youre just stating a fact.
 Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
 I think you need to go to Florida.
 Its only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house itll be..
 I was going to say good because Ill have all the help I need?
 Exactly.
 Alright
 Bye. Call me when you land.
 Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldnt the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
 There.
 Yeah?
 Well Im not the receptionist.
 I know, but I cant cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
 Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
 Hey, having fun?
 Well I know how it is. I know its a lot of fun. I dont know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
 Guys, I dont like this analogy.
 Its nice.
 Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
 Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
 Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
 No, three-month-old humans dont do that.
 Angela is such a liar!
 Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. Thats two sleep schedules, two naps that dont coincide, I mean, youll never sleep again.
 Yes, the conference room is set up. Ive got pens, Ive got paper, Ive got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
 We are good to goooo!
 Were good to goooo!
 Yes, of course, we couldve just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
 Watson carpet and tile.
 Hey, Darryl. You okay?
 No, you should go for it. I mean nothing wouldve happened with me and Jim if he didnt put himself out there.
 My husband would tell you to go for it.
 Thats it, last one.
 Thats true.
 Weapons.
 But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
 Thank goodness he was there.
 Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
 1-8-5-0-5.
 I just had a baby.
 Wow.
 How â€˜bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
  Oh boy. Oh no, Im not laughing at you. Im laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
 Aw, thats so sweet!
  He said, I did like Dwight? Hes gonna fire him.
 Robert doesnt talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
 Did you actually try your hardest?
 If Dwights about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. Thats all you can do.
 Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
 Well find another receptionist. I mean, thats easy. Well be fine.
  Hey, stranger!
 Aw, I missed you.
 Aw.
  This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, well be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
 Theres this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, its not -- it doesnt sound cool. You just have to see it.
 Well, I guess it doesnt look that cool either. But, its been up there a long time, so its become a pretty big deal.
 Did a good job, Buddy. Now its time to come home.
 What?
 You messed up saying your name?
 Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
 How can you give us performance reviews if you dont know us?
 No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
 I like working here.
 Phyllis.
 Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the managers position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. Im easy.
 Whoa, thats kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
 Well, I mean, the only reason he doesnt is because Im breastfeeding, and Phillip doesnt like a bottle.
 No.
 I think... youre a witch.
  Im amazing.
 Hey Jim. Stanleys back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
 Its nice. Its funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
 Yeah he does.
 Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
 Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
 Okay, which one of these looks more right?
 Welcome back, Stanley.
 Oh!
 Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
 Im sorry, were throwing a party for someone because theyre being horrible?
 Im still not sure why this woman is even here.
 I know, right?
 Phyllis!
 Hey, whats up?
 So were planning this party for Nellie, and were gonna make it really bad.
 No. Were gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
 What?
  Okay.
 What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You dont have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
 Oh, okay. Okay, I will.
 Or what if...
 We discuss...  the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party.  Not mean.
 What are you talking about? Yes we can.
 Okay, theyre almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?
 No, thats a great idea. Lets have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
 Cause theres someone already here named Pam.
 Oh!
 Thats not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
 Hey Hank.
 I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
 Yeah, he came and went.
 Lets just- lets go.
 Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book."
 You know, like arent some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
 Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we dont want to bother you any more than we already have.
 Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
 Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew theyd be good together.
  Kelly has been a handful in the past.
  But shes had a bad influence. Shes like an addict.  And I just had to get her clean.
 Dont shake our baby?
 Okay. Id never heard that before. So, thank you.
 Yeah, Im glad you said something.
 Yeah, theyre really great together.
 I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
 Yeah, hes so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
 I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
 Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
 That a couple of times-
 Okay, stop.
 All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
 Fair enough. Um... I dont think youre a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like Ive said this to you before I dont like you very much.
 Oh, no, no, no.
 Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
 Read through the pain. Be strong.
  Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
 Boo!
 Barf! Ugh, you suck!
 Youre not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryans soul?
 "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches."
 "He is a drifter out to sea."
 Its just so dumb.  But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
 Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
 Smokey, the bear?
 No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? Whats one more?
 I dont think you love Smokey Robinson. I think youre just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
 Oh my God, Ryan! Thats perfect! You have to go!
 250 dollars is nothing to the worlds biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
 Tears of a clown!
 Dwight, I dont think hes going to hurt anybody.
 Oh, great! That sounds good!
 Sounds like youre doing alright.
 Oh my god!
 Whoa!
 Are you-- Twice! For real?
 Life is Downton Abbey.
 Hm-hmm.
 Or you proved that he thinks youre gay.
 Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
 Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. im Sorry Oscar.
 Absolutely, its awesome--
 Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
 What do you feed her?
 Does she smell?
 Oh, it was this summer â€“
 Um, I am a little busy.
 Yeah, I can make you a list.
 Why dont I help you now?
 Okay.
 Sowhat do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
  Hey.
 I stole Nellies phone.
 What do you want from me?
 Sounds like it.
 Okay, thats enough.
 No, no, no!
 Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. Theyre all deleted.
 Ah. Ahh.
 Hey.
 Um yes. Definitely. With your hair â€“
 Certainly. Um you dropped your cell phone.
 Yep.
 No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
 No, I will not.
 Well â€“
 But sometimes he talks about flesh and bacchanals.
 No dont. Just put it out of your mind.
 I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
  Family picture!
 What? Honey, we talked about this.
 Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
 No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
 We decided that theres no way Dwight would harm a child.
 No, no.
 But its free. And well keep our eye on them.
 Yes!
 And well make sure Dwight doesnt do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Oh, great. Thank you.
 Okay.
 You ready?
 There we go.
 Ill just stand here?
 See? That wasnt so hard.
 You hit her?
 Oh, Andy.
 But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
 David, what are you doing here?
