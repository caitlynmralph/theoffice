  Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
  Just, well just keep going.
  Yes.
  Yes.
  I have everything.
  Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.  What up, 212?
  I should really get going.
  Im sure it was really lovely.
  OK, bye.
  No, Michael.
  Im in the wrong class...
  Oh, no. I just--
   I can see you!
  This is so cool.
  Lunch with a girl from my hall.
  Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. Im gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
  Can you put me down Im getting a little nauseous?
  The nerve.
  Theyre on the supply shelf.
  New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The citys awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
  Hi.  Mmm. Cause--
  What?
  Really, where?
  Wow, was it the age difference?
  Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
   Nice.
  Sorry.
  Youve already disappointed him so much.  He cant be expecting a lot from you.
  I... listen, umm, were still good for this weekend, right?
  No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
  OK.
  Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
  What are you doing?
  Oh my God!
  Oh my God!
  Yes!
  Well, I should go.
 No, dont.  Im mad at them.
 Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
 What?  Why not?
 Come on, it wont be that bad.
  Hi everyone!
 Wow.
 No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi.
 Sorry.
  So you know Stacy, right?
 Theres no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
 So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogres DeTech half an hour early so they dont have to sit on the slab.
 Anyway, Bogres TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
 No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Dont interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
 So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way.  You cant reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacys new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
 Yes!
 No, its horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
 No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why cant you just be in art class with me?
 Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.
 Hey you!
 Not even. Im doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
 I cant hear anything, theres like, theres like machines going-
 I cant hear anything!
 OK.
 Im not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. Were just... a little out of sync.  You know, thats all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
 Hi.
  Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
 I figured Id catch you walking to your car, but...
 Ill leave a message.
 I guess this is just one of those days.  Itll get better.
 I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
 And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
 Youre probably upset that Im even at a Laundromat right now.  But, dont worry, Im being safe.  And Im headed home.  Im... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
 Anyway, um... I miss you.
 Okay, thanks.
 New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
 Hey.
 Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
 Hey Michael.
  You are such a dork! Shots!
 Im not drunk.
 Okay, I do not sound like that.
 Scranton.
 Hey.
 Thanks.  My costumes getting a lot of attention.
 So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I cant even take off my hat, because then Im Hitler.
 Hey!
 How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
 I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think theyre into the idea. Theyre probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, shes the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. Shes the best! The absolute best."
 Okay, so heres what Im thinking. Im gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasnt in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
 So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
 Okay, okay.
 Oookay....
 They came up with that idea really fast.
 Hey guys.
 Hi!
 Yup!
 Cute.
 Miles Davis.
 Chet ...something.
  Dizzy Gillespie.
 I dont know if Im gonna make any money with art.
 I mean its a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I dont try now, I never will. So...
 ... Got you.
 For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
 Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, its very subtle.
 Thank you.
 Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
  Hey, New York aint free. Get back to work.
 Its the worlds tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
 We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So were not telling anyone.
 I should go.
  I miss him.
 Dont give him Snoopy. Thats mine.
  What was that?
 Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
  Good luck.
 I love you.
  Jim? Jim?
 Maybe its because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
  Ooh, cute shoes online.
  Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
  Thats what she said! Thats what she said! Thats what she said!
  That was weird.
 Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didnt go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
 Did you do something to her?
 Well, somethings off.
 Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
  Right Dwight is loud.
 Hey, what are you doing here?
 Its Alex.
 Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
 OK.
 Whats up?
 Wow.
 Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
 Jims in Scranton.
 Ill see you tomorrow.
  Cant believe this.
  I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
 I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
 I have to stay and retake it.
 That means another twelve weeks.   Can you do this for another three months?
  I know.
  Right.
  Yeah Im fine.  Um... my cell phone batterys low, so I have to let you go.
 Alright.
  Love you. Bye.
 Im coming back the wrong way.   Its not because of you.  I dont like graphic design. Thats it.  Stop smiling. I really didnt like it.  Its just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you cant tell me what to do. Got it?
 I missed you too.
 Uh, yeah.
 Im not going inside.
  Oh, come on!  Do you see this?  Disgusting.
 Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
 Dont you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
 Just because someone likes things clean, doesnt mean theyre rich.
 When it comes down to it, its a health issue.  I should have written that.
  Why arent you as mad or interested in this as me?
 Are you inching away from me?
 Reach your arms out.
 What do you need, Michael?
 "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  Im too shy to tell you that I love you."
 Thank you.
 I know, can you believe it?
 I guess thats why we have a temp, huh?
 How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
 Youve seen things cleaned before though, right?
 I dont know anything about that.
 Here?
 Sure.
  What are we doing at your parents house?
 I dont get it.
 I love it.
 Yeah, I love it!
 I mean, you bought me a house!
 You bought me a house!
 Um, do we have to sleep in your parents bedroom?
 And the clown?
 New chairs?
 Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
  Good? Yeah, he said good, Im good...
 Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
 Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
 Michael?
 Ive talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know theyre with me on this.
 What? Jim.
 Hey.
 So um, Ive been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
 I really think you should reconsider.
 Yeah, I know.
 But I really think you should reconsider.
 Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. Im not threatening you. I love you.  But you should know, youre on very dangerous ground .  All right.
 Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
 Well that never happened.
 So, I guess thats how theyre gonna play this. It is on.  It is so on.
 Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years Ive had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
 Aww.
 Thats cool.  Mm, good stuff.
 Thank you.
 Michael?
 Hey!
 You got a second?
 Oh, good.
 Oh, that mustve been so fun.
 Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
 Yeah, is that a new tie?
 That is amazing!
 What?
 No.
  No way!
 Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
 Yeah.
 Heres what I was thinking everyone sits on a chair every day...
 But not everyone...
 Or even uses the copier every day.
 Yeah, right?
 ...Thats it.
 All right, see you later...
 Hot tie guy.
 No, copiers great.
 Yeah. I have my copies.
 And I have my original.
 So suck it.
 Theres that ass!
 Woo! Yeah. Aw, dont take it away!
 Did somebody call Hank?
 You can try mine.
 Yeah, know what?
 You can do that?
 Youre gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
 Or chairs?
 So whats it gonna be?
 Let me just say, youve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
 Hey.
 Thanks Michael.
 Yeah, I guess, since I won.
 I wish that youd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
 I know.  If she wasnt an alcoholic before, she is now.
 I knew it.
 I knew some of it.
 Its Christmas.
 Thank you. I knew it.
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Im sorry, hes not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
 Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. Its actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
 Quick announcement new year, new candy.
 Okay, be careful, Kevin. Theyre kind of spicy.
 Yeah.
 So, maybe just try one at first, and then if its okay, have a couple more...
 Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
 Of course you will.
 Oh my God!
 Have you seen her with her bangs?
  Kevin!
 Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We dont even give him full internet access.
 No, because...
 Hillary swank.
  Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
 The phones are dead.
 Try a different door.
 What do we do?
 We dont normally download films illegally.  Because were honest,  hardworking people.
 But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
 My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jims been great. But Im gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
 Hes not saying what he needs to say.
 Yeah.
 Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
 So he doesnt share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughters fiance?
 Hey.
 Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
||
 I dunno. I mean, maybe hell talk to you about some of this stuff cause he cant really talk to me about it.
 Youre good to talk to.
 What?  Oh...
 Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
 What did you say to my dad?
 After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
 What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
 Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  Hes supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
 Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!
 Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, Im sorry, Michaels not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
 I think he meant personal day.
 Phyllis theres a package for you.
  Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah Ill see ya then.
 Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, youve never doubted for a second that Im the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess hes never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
 Yeah.
  When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.
 Michael! Its really good to see you.
 What?
 Ugh.
 Good morning.
 He brought a sled.
 Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
 Separate rooms.
 Im going to say it anyway.
 This is a new cardigan.
 No.
 Can I turn on the radio?
 But then you fall asleep and theres nothing for me to do.
 Thats dangerous.
 Thats okay I can... Im fine. Ill just play a song in my head.
 No, that was a long time ago.
 No, Im not even wearing that much.
 I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldnt hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
  Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
 Stop it, please.
 Please cut it out.
 Michael!
 No its not.
 So when are you due?
 Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
 Oh, hes cute.
 What is happening there?
 Its really sweet.
 Uh, theyre good. Uh, Jims good. Were engaged.
 Thank you.
 I like her.
 Im serious. Um, Im really glad I came.
 Because, um, cause Ill never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. Shes happy and, I dont know, it feels good.
 Are you asleep?
 No, remind me.
 Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly.
 Okay, lets go.
 Yeah, screw em. Lets do this.
 Were engaged.
 Oh, wow, thank you!
 ... Okay, lets go.
 So, detour. Were now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I dont think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!   Ive been driving too long.
  Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
 You look good.
 Im so sorry, Michael.
 Shes not doing it to hurt you.
 Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didnt want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
 You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then shell realize what shes missing.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Maybe. One step at a time.
 You can do this.
 Oh, God.
 Michael, get off the floor!
  No, no, no, you have to do it-
 That was weird, huh? Its all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  Im just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that Im going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor youre gonna get. Forrest Gump.
  Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Hollys boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw!  Cutting down the competition.
  Dont look up. Dont look up.
 No.
 What?
 Oh, Michael...
 You did what?
 She never sent it to you?
 No.
 No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. Its a violation of her trust.
 Because, she didnt send it to you!
 I could read it.
 Yeah, I could read it.
 Go get your laptop.
  What? Im not in love with her.
  Its deleted.
 She still has feelings for you.
 I cant tell you specifically, but... its not over.
||
 No, we dont need to do that.
 You mean Tony?
 Oh, Michael.
 Good morning, can I help you?
 Im sorry, hes not in right now.
 Shoot.
 They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But Id like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.  Vending machine.
 That is a great idea.
  Um, oh boy, lets see, hes really...
 There he is!
 Ayyyy!
 That was funny.
 This is our first and only Valentines Day as fiances.
 Really, Jim?  On Cupids birthday?
 I cant see them when theyre on the floor
 You cant be a part of our relationship, Michael.
 What do you think?
 Were in.
| Anything to get out of that office.	|
 Wow,  thats impressive.
 What?
 Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
 Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
 No, you just have little dainty fingers.
 Whats the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
 Oh, damn.  Theyve been in there for like ten minutes.
 Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
  What?
 Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
 Do you think they dined and dashed?
 I thought we were having a nice time.
 Yeah.
  Mine too.
 My God.
 Yep, that, yeah.
  Yeah, thats no problem.
  Sure. Uh huh.
 Im on the phone.
  You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye.  It really makes us look unprofessional.
  Whos there?
 Buddha who?
 Great.
 Now theres, theres butter on my desk.
  Good morning, Michael.
 Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
 Jelly beans.
 You dont have to wait that long. I mean, you dont have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
 Thats psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David.  No, Im sorry hes not back from the Civil Rights rally. Ill have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
 When Michaels skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. Stopping a fight in the parking lot.  An Obama fashion show.  Whatever... that is. Or trapped in an oil painting. Im gonna save that one.
 Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. Hes having a colonoscopy. Alright, Ill find out if hes out yet.
 I dont think Jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her.
  Shush.  Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and its really romantic.
  Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
 Sure.
 Its actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
 OK.
  Not classy.
  Hi, can I help you?
  Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
  Michael, theres a Charles Miner here to see you.
  Yeah, are you coming out now?
  This is what you did last night?
  He just had to wear his tux today.
  Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
   Uh, hi, can I help you? I dont think anyone here-
  Oh no.
  I can tell Michaels mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
  And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
  Cupcake. Its cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
  Its really just a regular shaped cake.
  He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
  Okay focus. Focus.  Youre in the right building, youre with the right people; what happened?
  Do you have any leads on a job?
  Hi.
  Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. Itll be a few minutes.
  Hmm?
  Im working on it Kev.
  Itll be ready soon.
  Is that what soon means to you?
  Then come back soon.
  During the course of business, a copier goes though something called Normal wear and tear.
  Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didnt set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.
  No, Im sure theyre pretty much the same as the English instructions.
  Thats a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
  Hmm...
  Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
  Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  Cause its a pretty big risk.
  Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
  Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
  Yeah. Good.
  Mmm-hmm
  Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment youve all been waiting for. Right?
  Meredith...   Oh... so uh... G-44.  Its not ready Kevin!
  Im at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
  Hows it working?
  Good.
  I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
   Michael?
  Oh no.
  Im going with him.
  Im going.
  Michael, wait!  Im coming with you.
  Yeah.
  Great. Uh, except, I dont want to be a receptionist anymore.
  Salesman.
  Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
  Probably.
  Okay, see you later.
 Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And were starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.  Look, its official!
 Michael, you were expecting me, right?
 Are you wearing anything under the robe?
 This looks great, Michael.
 Yes, please.
 ... Square is fine.
 So, what do you say we get started?
 Im full.
 I feel good.  Wow.
 Yeah. Im excited to start the company.
 We did that. So, whats next? Michael, just stop for a second.  Michael. Stop for a second.
 No, I know you are.
 Just let me have... Oh.
 Fine!  Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry.
 You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
 I know! No, Im saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
 Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.  Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
 I think you should get dressed.
 Michael, that seems impossible.
 We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
 Great.
 No. What? Why?
 No. Were not gonna hire Ryan.
 Okay.
 Well find him.
 Really?
 We have an investor already?
 Michael, thats fantastic.
 Hey! We need to get you dressed!
 I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. Thats one thing Ive learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.  Hey! You look great!  Lets go!
 Next on the list - open the mail.
 No, okay. Its fine. Its fine. Were just gonna add "find office"...
 Next on the list --  song parodies.
 Great. Lets sing it in the car.
 Yeah.
 We can do this.
  We got Vikram!
 We have a meeting with an investor today.
 He can be.
 Hm. Im looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
 Yes. Yes, its possible.
 Michael! Whats going on?
 Hey, Ryan.
 This wasnt on the list.
 No.
 Its not.
  When did you add this to the list?
 You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
 No.
 What is he doing?
 Oh my God.
 Sorry!
 Sure.
 Beat.
  Nana?
 It means grandmother.
 I cant do this.
 I cant do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
 I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
 We dont have any money. We dont have an office. We dont have anything.
 How come out of everyone in the office, Im the only one that went with you? Is it because Im that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesnt even believe in you!
 Yeah.
 I could work here. I could see this.
 Are you good?
 Im good.
 Morning Michael!
 What should we do now?
 I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And its cold in there. Cause its technically a closet.
 That is so insulting.
 Because the thing youre saying Im good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
 Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
 Shut up!
 Really!
 Seriously? This is whats so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
 I dont want to look at your friend Jasmines boobs all day.
 Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
 Oh yeah I bet.
 Michael, we can hear you.
 Okay its my turn.
 Give it back for what? Whatre you gonna do with it?
 Youre gonna make another "spreadsheet."
 Yeah exactly. Its my turn.
 Come on! Ryan!
 Definitely.
 We could work from home.
  .... Corner idea?
 How would we know that?
 I thought that was your corner.
 So my corners the one with the copier?
 No thanks.
 Hey Im here to see Charles.
 Hey Charles.
 I know youre a very busy man so Ill cut right to the chase. Id like my old job back.
 Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
 Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
 Personal shopper?
 Well it was great catching up with you. And Ill see you around the building.
 Im just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if thats okay. The air smells so good. I dont remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
 Hey.
 Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
 Thats as specific as Id like to be.
 Were small, but were eager to make a name for ourselves.
 Nope, I dont have a card, but Ill do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
 Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well wed like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
 We already offered free delivery!
 Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
 A guarantee of what?
 And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
 I made a sale!
 Oh!
 Things are a little slow here. And theres only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out theres no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someones face.
 Were getting pretty good at it.
 The timelines messy.
 Im confused. Am I walking down the aisle to You Can Call Me Al?
 I dont know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
 Mm-hmm.
 Im not gonna do that.
 Im here. Im a part of this now.
 Michael, are you alright?
 Tell us what youre talking about.
 We cant help you if you dont just tell us what happened.
 Michael!
 I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
  Sounds neat.
 Oh my God, I think weve been robbed!
 We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says "Alleluia Church of Scranton." in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
 You didnt happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
 Oh, awesome.  Youre a life saver.   Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
 Do you drink this every day?
  Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  Its, uh, its a paper company now.  Its not for the church.
 Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
 Yeah, I know what a loft is.
 Corporate greed?
 Did it help?
 When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You dont blame the child.  He didnt know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid.  I trust you."
 We have maybe a month.  I dont know what Im gonna do.
 Thats what Michael said.
 I like it.
 Steve Martins not dead, Michael.
 You want to hear something sad?
 So Jim and I are getting married and the weddings really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
 Really?
 Seriously?  Are you being serious?
 Yes.
 Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
 No, Michael.
 We have to come from a position of strength.
 Mm-hmm.
 $60,000.
 Are you kidding me?
 Can you give us another minute please?
 Michael.
 Why are you assuming youd get the whole thing?
 No, Michaels right.  Jobs are safer.
 Agreed.  But thats all, okay.
 Thank you.
 Thats right.
 Alright!
  Who is it?
    Boscovs at the Steamtown Mall?
 Well, you have good taste.
 What?
  Oh, I, um...
 Thank, Michael.
 That ones great.
 What?
 Mm-hmmm.
  We were something else.
 Mmm.
  You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  Its okay, Ryan.
 He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  Hell make his decision by the end of the day.
 Oh.  I think you should get it.  Youve changed a lot and youd be good at it.
 Yeah.
   Just tell me.
 No, okay.
 Okay, I get it.  Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?   Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
 I did?
 For real, youre not kidding?
 I did?
 Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
 Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
  Oh.  I really thought I didnt get it.
 Yeah.  Cause you said I didnt
 What about Ryan?
 Yeah.  Maybe you shouldnt fake fire people anymore.
 Thanks, Michael.

 Not cool, Dwight.
 Oh, I cant do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.

 If you dont take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
 Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
 So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
 Were getting married today.
 Tell em how it happened.
 And very expensive.
 You cant leave anyone out.
 Ok, just get to the good part.

 Okay.
 Oh, dont get us wrong, we like picnics.
 Tell them what happened last year.
 No, no, that guy who hit on me.
 Yeah, you dont grab these  for balance.
 Hey Charles.
 Do you want me to beat him up for you?
 Back off, Dwight.  Hyuh!  What?
