 Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But Im not that good at puzzles.
 So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldnt get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
 The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
 Angelas cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you cant eat cats. You cant eat cats, Kevin.
 Ill take him.
 I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
 Go ahead
  Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
 A wheel is supposed to spin.
  Okay, thats what Im talking about! Big money, big money!  Mug duty?
 This sucks.
 Yeah, I dont think that you understand wheels.
  Oh boy! Whats happening?
  Heifers International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. Its a great prank.
 Whats the craziest place youve ever made whoopie?
 Totally. George Clooney.
  What is the craziest place youve ever made whoopie?
Thats me.
 As would I.
 My name is Kevin.
 That is my name.
 They call me Kevin.
 Cause thats my name.
 Next stop pies!
 At five? Thats only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
 Wh...
 314 pies.
 Well, its the...carry the four...and...it doesnt work.
 Well now I dont even feel like pie. Wait...no its back.
 Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour were just gonna barely make it.
 I insult you, Oscar.
 I insult you! To your face!
 Then why dont you do something about it?
 You dont have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes!
 Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
 It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates â€˜Monster Mash. I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
 Thats beautiful. No, I totally get that.
 I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
 What happened?
 Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
  I dont know what youre talking about.
 I... did not.
  Oh really, Angela? Thats interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh!  I have to go to the bathroom!
 I have to go to the bathroom!
  I have to go to the bathroom!
||
 Please, stop.
 Please, stop.
  I cant, its too much!
 Yeah, Oscars in big trouble.
  Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if Im getting a promotion?
 Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldnt screw up your secret with Angela. Ive been really worried about that.
 Hi.
 Oscar, were in the middle of talking.
 Oh that is nice. Classy move.
 What are you doing?
 Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
 You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.
 Come on Oscar, were not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support.
 It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
 I totally forgot about the affair for a minute.  Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesnt even know.  Her life is a complete sham!
 Nice!
 Thats the winter season., three months.
 Whats happening in three months?
 Make it go taller.
 No, not taller this way, taller this way.
 Youre not getting this, Peter. Â Make it go wider... up!
 Me and Pete are building a tower.
 Obviously. Hes a sweet kid, Darryl. But hes not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
 Huh?
 Yep, yep, yep.
 Okay, I got this one.
 No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
 Yeah.
 Nice. Â Pretty soon, were gonna be at the ceiling.
 I am Oscar Martinez.
 Wha-- wh--
 Nice! Yeah.
 Nice. Nice.
 You did it.
 So were not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
 Well, you are the one in charge of it.
 Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
 No.
 Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
 "now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho."
 Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and hes like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--"
 Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
 Nope.
 No, its not.
 I wish my car had a bathroom.
  I love this hog mama.
  What is maw?!
 To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
 No.
 Oh, the Nets are super tough.
 The Hawks are terrible. Theyre always terrible.
 No.
 Here man.  You need that more than me.
 Yeah
 I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
 An Escalade.
 Big mistake.
 So does this mean youre gonna take Darryl back?
 Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? Cause Im free, literally forever.
   No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
 I wonder what happened over there. Ive been sitting here the whole time.
 Hey, so how was it? I mean the sex with Jan.
 Taste test? Im in!
 Yeah, were aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
 Alright everybody, whos in?  Angela?  Dont make us come over there.
 Alright, lets go.
 No way.
 Ok guys, â€œwe all drink them allâ€.
 Yes!
 Yes!
 One!
 Two
 Three
 Four!
 Pam! Pam, look out! Erins gunning for your job!
 Pam, look out!
 It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
 So long, noise!
 Well I cant stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
 Yeah!
 I dont get it.
 A lightbul--
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Thats a flush.
 Ooh, I havent heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
 Ooh, its when you get a free sandwich after youve already eaten ten sandwiches.
 Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because thats the guy that Erins flirting with?
 Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
 Lets get this over with, Pam.
 Meredith, I tell you all the time.
 Meredith, I tell you all the time.
 Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping...  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
 Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight cant come to your sons birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
 OK. I understand. Ill just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
  Opening with pub pastries? Thats a bold play. Theyre saying, its only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
 Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
 You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and youre just using them. Again, the food was very good.
 Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, Ive been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. Its been yummy. But now, Andys coming back. So, I guess its goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
 OK, Ill say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
  Ew! Ill be your foot buddy.
 He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
 You know Pams mural? Well, Frank...
 Whoa.
 Pete...
 Pete what?
 Im Kevin.
 Didnt you two used to do it?
 Oh, why dont your famous stomachs help you now?
  Yep. Acidic, all right.
 Packer, we accept.
 They do. Its awful. And, its getting worse every day.
 You dont know that.
 James Bond was a spy.
 Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
  Oh, that was fantastic.
 Why would you ask me?
  My night was just like that.  Meaning normal.
 Nope. I did not see you either.
  Ah.
 Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
 Uh oh. Shes doing it again.
  Whats going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
 Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
 This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
  Did you see this?
 Andy, are there documentary groupies?
 Of course.
 What was that word they said when they showed me â€œSkrald mandâ€? Whats that mean in Danish? Cool guy?
 Cool. Superhero.
 Ooh, theres Angela! I work with her!
 Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didnt know, you didnt know, and you didnt freaking know. But I knew!
 Yes, we did it!
 Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
 Ohh.
 Yes!
 Uh huh.
 Of course.
 Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
 No.
 This is flatter.
 I cant. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
 Fine.
 Im not giving up.  Im going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
 The Mark 47 is ready for launch.  Less paste.
 Wait, all of them?
 Ive never met anyone like that.
 Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I dont know. You know whos really funny? This bird, in the park, that cant fly right. Id pay to see him. But I dont have to cause the park is free!
 Our question isâ€”it seems dumb.
 Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. Youre too character-y to be a lead and youre not fat enough to be a great character actor.
 Ooh, theres a great play about a salesman.
 I dont think so.
 No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
 Dwights the new manager. He freaking did it.
 Yeah, and Dwight, Id like to be the first to say congratulations.
 What do you think that was about?
  Awesome!
 Night, Oscar.
 But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.
 Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richards. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
 Guys.
 Guys.
 Guys.
 Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says â€œbold frontâ€ instead of â€œcold frontâ€? Its insane.
 Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. Its all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
 Whoa.
 Thats totally uncool.
 Right. Now.
 Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.
 What? Im moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
 Dont tell me what to do!
 No, I dont need this! And you obviously dont need me.
 Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
 Hes not that smart. He doesnt know where I hid his duck.
 Cant hear you. Im giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
 Phillip got this for me?
 That was a really cool move.
 Whoa.
 What a chubbers. Whoa.
 Im losing my balance.
 Whoa!
 You wanna play with the cactus?
 So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided were gonna be best friends. Hes a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
 Bye, Phillip. High five.
 Yeah.
 Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
 Yes!
 I feel scared a little.
 Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
 Yes! Wait, why?
 â€œGet out.â€
 What does that mean?
 Imgood.
  At least I got chocolate.
 Well, well, well, well, well, well. Thats six â€œwells.â€ Did I get that number right, Dwight?
 Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
 Well, w
 Youre just saying that to make me feel better.
 Is that all it was?
 Come here
 I missed you!
  People actually dance to this. Its in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
  Yeah, people hate you.
 Wheres the, uh, basket for gifts?
 Okay.
  â€œArise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. â€œ
 Thats not
  What was that stuff?
 Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
 Oh, I dont know.
 Hey, this is better.
 Yeah, we all need a drink.  What thetheres only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
 Yes!
 If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, its that if you film anybody long enough, theyre going to do something stupid. Its only human natural.
 What is it?
 Oh, Yes!
 Oscar. Oscar.  I think Im gay.
  Its just that Im so emotional.
 No, but maybe the reason
