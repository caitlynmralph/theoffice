  Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
  Yeah.
  Hi Jan.
  Hows the candle game?
  Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
  Hey!
  Thank you, Holly.
  Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
  Oh, my God!
   What?
  Firrrrre-duh guy!
  Yeah.
  You too.
  Because youre kind of doing Michael Clump.
 I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
 Oh come on!  Hes right there.  He was hired.   Oh check it out, "Hired Guy."
 Its a trap.
 I think were out.
 I think she got it as a tip, but I dont know why she didnt just take cash.
 But Phyllis, its not his baby.
 Michael, the babys already been born.
 So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
 OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
 Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
 Oscar, Im now going to be prone to surges.
 Hi, Im Kevin. And Ill do your taxes.
 Federal and State.
 Fine.
  Dammit Creed! Ive been up since four!
 Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
 You love your mom.
 T minus...
  You did it, man.  Day one. Congrats.
  Yes.
 So Jim, youre gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
 Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope thats okay.
 Michaels a genius.
 Hey Michael, whats 394 times 5,912?
 Fire girl.  Too soon?
 Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
 Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
 Whoo-hoo!
 Hot tamales.
 Uh oh.
 Oh, Im sorry. I didnt realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I wouldve admitted it, and stopped right away.
 Because I wouldnt want an innocent person, who doesnt know anything about the form...  What?
 How about, "Im sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"
 Were not listening.
 Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
  Not at all.
 She looks like a monster.
 That is not the question.
 Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
  Five. Five to five.
 So what do we do now?
 The debate is whether she is hot.
 Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I dont want to bang a painting.
 Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
 Hes making all these fancy, uh, its a gut thing.
  No, its is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
 Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
  Wait, what?
 This is ridiculous.
 Its out in the hall.
  I cant keep doing this forever.
 Call it.
 I would want to live with no legs.
 Michael, I think youre whats stressing everybody out.
  Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
  He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order.
 Im almost done.
 I didnt eat lunch.  I didnt eat all my lunch.
 It... yeah.
 Wait, you didnt give it back?
 Any cat, you mean.
 Why would we-
 Is that what I think it is?
||
 That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
 No way.
  Oh, the other ones watching.
||
 This is getting weird.
 Ohhh...
 I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
 Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
 Oh, then pick TV.
 No, watching TV at work is really cool.
  For a rainy day.
 I miss Stacy.
 I cant even imagine.
 Was he in to you in like a gay way?
 A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says "I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City."
 My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said "Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!" and she said that were done.
 Hello.
 Im from here!
 Thank you, Michael.
 At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  Its really cool.
 I used to go there with my fiance . Before she left me .   No, I mean, before I left her .  She left me.
 I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
 Hey, Im sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
 Are you on email?
 Cool. Bye.
 Good Valentines.
 I think I should call her.
 Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
 But I do like her just the way she is.
 Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I dont like getting advice from more than one person at a time. Im a textbook over-thinker.
 You guys are throwing a lot at me.
 Right.
  Like that?
 Lynn, Im just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
 I think you have the best smile. Id like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
 Nice.  Boobs.
  Ni-
  Hey!
  Michael?
  I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
  Ok.
  That hes wasted 15 years of your life?
  Michael is that scotch?
  Pam?
  When will the new copier be ready?
  You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
  Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
  Sometimes.
   Oh!
  I always thought Michael got a bad rap. Hes a good guy.  And hes super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  Hes all the way over there.
  I think hes singing.
  Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
  But you didnt want to start with us?
  Phones?
 Oh, right. Thanks.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you.  Oscar, your mom!
 Please hold.  Andy! Phone call.
 Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
 Okay. Andy, get ready.  Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
| Oh, man!	|
 Hold it.
  This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you.
  Just... dont answer that call!
 Your call is very important to us. Ple-
 Wag.
 I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boys name?
 Try it in another sentence.
 I guess I could be nicer.
 Hi.
  At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevins Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  Im serious about this stuff.  Im up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  Its a recipe passed down from Malones for generations.  Its probably the thing I do best.
 So, like, a disco cafe?
 Yeah.
 Yeah. This place is great.
 Im sorry.
 Yeah. Respect the lei.
  Is there a cookie?
 I wanted a cookie.
 Michael, isnt that Holly?
  I got it.
 Set!
  Yeah!
 Its six to six. Its a nail-biter.
