 Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; theyre just keeping it a secret. Right?
 Are you kidding me?
 Whos we, you and Jim?
 Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
 Oh, I bet you ask?
 I bet you were.
 What
 Whoa!
||
  Oh well, if they arent together now, then they probably never will be. I thought theyd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
 Michael?
 You cannot make me run.
 It is not a real charity. Its stupid Michael, and Im not gonna do it.
 You didnt run for me...
 ...when I thought I had skin cancer.
 No.
 I just dont want to run. I didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes.
 Back off me.
 I knew it!
  Fire!
 You werent here for that.
 When he started the fire.
 Little old man boy.
 Bearded man boy.
 No way!
 Yeah, later dude.
 Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
 What does that mean?
 Tuna Tuna Tuna.
 And he can get any girl that he wants.
 Tuna. Check you later.
 I knew it!
  Fire!
 You werent here for that.
 When he started the fire.
 Little old man boy.
 Bearded man boy.
 No way!
 Yeah, later dude.
 Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
 What does that mean?
 Tuna Tuna Tuna.
 And he can get any girl that he wants.
 Tuna. Check you later.
  Dude, you gotta believe.
  That was so awesome.
  Isnt 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
  Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
 Wait! Alfredos Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
 No, no.
 Oscar, talk to him.
 Oh no, its bad.  Its real bad.  Its like eating a hot circle of garbage.
 We think its a straight forward kidnapping.
 Whats going on?
 Were getting hungry out there.  Were all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredos Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
 Good pizza.
 Different stuff.
 I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
 The bar uses an applause meter. That is why its so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
 Dammit.
 I know whats right, but Im not gonna say, because youre all jerks who didnt come see my band last night.
 I dont know.
 I do gamble Michael.
 The mob.
||
 Yeah, women be shoppin.
 Shh.
 True, its best to hide our money problems from women.
  Mama Bear!
 I kind of know what its like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.
 Michael, that was fun.
 Damn it!
 Damn it!
 Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that theres going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
 Oh, Ill take em.
 You never call back.
 About what?
 Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
  Oh, awesome!
  I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
  Hurts like hell.
 If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then Id take her for myself.
 Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
 Not anymore.
 Its a bitter situation.
 No, thirty.
 Yes.
 Nice.
 Michael, please he--
 We need to assemble the five families.
 We have to.
 The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. Theres Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul." W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
  Im calling the meeting anyway.
  I... have... things...
 We want our parking spaces back!
 W.B. Jones construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
 After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see...  Its just nice to win one.
 We did it.
 We got our spaces back.
 Later.
 Way to go, man.
 Oh God.
 Michael you could put your initials in it.
 Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
 All the girlfriends that Ive ever had have worn glasses.
 Yeah, its kind of a turn-on for me actually...
 Like librarians.
 Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"?
 Michael, if you hadnt told us this, then we wouldve thought that you were actually firing him.
  Its Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and hes mad. So thats about it!
 What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
 Im gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next months rent.
 Andy, youre up, lets go!
 Yeah.
 Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
 Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
 Oooh!
 Hi.
 I do the numbers.
 Do you want a M&M?
 Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesnt take them.
 Yeah.
 Hi.
 I cant decide what to get.
 Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
 Hmm...
 Im totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
  Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
 Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
 Okay, bye.
 Yeah, Michael, Im at Gerritys. You have to come down here.
 No, I-I brought my money. Michael, theres something that you need to see.
 Just hurry.
 It was great to see you, Jan.
 Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
 I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
 Yeah.
 Ill go to the diner with you.
 Yeah, we can go eat pie.
 Me too.
