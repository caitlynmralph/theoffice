 Well, what if youre cold?
 Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
 Oh, yeah. Thisll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
 Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
 That was awesome!
 I know how you got it.
 Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
 I never seen herpes on you.
 You have a penis?
 Michael, youre at least forty six!
 It feels unbelievable!
 ...unbelievable.
 It feels amazing!
 Yes.
 Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
 You got it! Lance Armstrongs Bike!
 Nice.
 I could sing it.
 But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
 Hes like a better-looking Andy.
 Yeah.
 Oh, nice!
 Or the me that stinks.
  Suns in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
 Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but Im here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
 Croak!
 Nice.
  Satchel!
 The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
 You own a bar?
 I dont think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
 I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. Im like an elephant in that way.
 Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creeds a maybe.
 Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
 Theyre really upset about the whole Danny situation.
 Yeah, but wait, dont tell them that we said anything to you.
 Or youre dead.
 Okay.
 I am so sorry.
 I just thought-
 Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-
 I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
 Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didnt tell you first.
  You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
  you, Gabe!
 Pam. Can you vote for other people?
 I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
 With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
  Give me the baby!
  Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
  They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
 No! I bet hes wishing he was strangling someone!
 Hey, you going tonight?
 Yeah! You gotta go to the bosss party!
 No hes not the boss.
 Cause, youre the boss!
  I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
 I cant believe were missing that!
 Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
 Big Boobs.
 Wow.

 I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" Im pretty sure I timesed it right.
 Dunh-duh-na-dah!
 You had me at "Sex."
  Awesome!
  You guys know how to get out?
  Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!
 An antacid that you only take once a week.
 Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
 Its too big of a pill to swallow.
 Thank God.
 Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
 Well, I wish for a million wishes.
 Then see you later building.
 I said see you later building.
 Oh, I got it, you guys, how bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, why I oughta, and the girls are like, lets go shopping!.
 Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
 Oh, right. The state senator.
 Oh, that would be impressive... if
 I would, but I dont want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
 Yeah.
 Hi, Toby.
 Yeah.
 Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
 Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people arent looking. You dont think... its not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
 Oh no, thats, thats not happening.
 Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
 I bet you didnt even bring us anything, did you?
  For your feet!
 Wow, thats awesome!
  Congratu-ohhh.
 Hey!  Right back atcha, bitch!
 Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I havent yet. But its okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
 Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
 I dont know. Im glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
 This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
 Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
 God, I hate it.
 All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
 Can I get some candy, or something?
 You were super mean.
 It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldnt be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
 Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
 Well, I am.
 Im going to help you.
 Hey, Ryan.
  Hows your fart project coming?
 Me.
 Hey, Ryan.
 Andy, Im no Jim. The only way that Im Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
 Then I wont let you down.
 Yep.
 Go.
  Yes!
 There are some people who have charm and some people who dont. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
  Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an.  And then double it! .
 No. Yes!
 No. Im fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that Im gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner.  . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!
 What?
 Red gloves.
 I cant wait.
 Ok, its two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
 Ditto.
 Nice!
 Yes, well done!
 I dont know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
 Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
 Oooh.
 Booby honking.
 Butt honking.
 As has Kevin!
 She goes to another school.
 Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
  Hey, buck up, buddy!
 Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
 Better luck next time, pal.
 Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
 Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
 Its like one of the best movies Ive ever seen in my life.
 Or carnivals!
 Youre eating eight year old tomatoes?
 Ive got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes.
 Yes!
 Nice! We got burned!
 What dont you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you dont know what the word approved means.
 I have very little patience for stupidity.
  Mean but good!
 Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
 I do know how to read though!
  Hes right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
 I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
 Thats silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
 Well, like I said, I wasnt offended, but Ill stand here for the big show.
 Woah, I love her. How much for that?
 200.
 45.
 Damn it.
 Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
 Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
 Yea.
 Nice.
 No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
 no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
 No but thats not fair.
 Hey guys its my turn.
 Yeah I told you, you cant shoot people.
 This is stupid and I want my money back. Wheres the money?
 Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
 And that is Dallas.
 Thats awesome!
 All of us?
  Nope! Its not Ashton Kutcher. Its Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!
 Burnt! Its lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
 Interesting.
 Awesome!
 Nice!
 Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
  Hi!
 I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
 Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
 For birthdays!
 Oh!
 Oh...
 Better...
 But...
 Michael, Im pretty much okay with who I am now.
 Sounds beautiful!
 Im going to!
 Finally! That old shredder sucked.
 Yeah, it wont shred magazines.
 I know...
 No, its just... that old shredder sucks.  Just get one thatll shred magazines.
 This all sounds great to me.   But I could see how some people might think that theyre bad.  I dont know what to think.
 Jim only says that because hes in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!   Which doesnt exist.
 Yes!
 Yeah, I say we just go for it!
 Yes.
 Oh, I think its 18 hundo.
 Didnt drop a single ball!
 Hot!
 That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.   Kevin...
  Jim, you coming?
 Yeah.
 Whoa.
 Yes!  Okay.
  One...
  No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
 You could put a banana in it.
 In case you werent hungry now, but you got hungry later.
 Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
 Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
  What the  is that?  Oh, my...
 Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
 My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
 Hey, Jo!
 No, under the jacket.
 I dont feel anything.
 Push harder, Dwight.
 Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.
 Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
 Dont eat it.
 Another one?
 Thank you.
 Nice.
 Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
  Um... Business!
  The Botanical Gardens, Scrantons hidden gem. Dont eat any berries you dont recognize.
  Yeah! Tell us a story.
  Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? Thats hot.
  We dont tell her.
   Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
   Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
  Its good. Its just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
  Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
  Okay... well what do I want in a manager?... let me see.  what do I want?...
  So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
  What do I want?... Im looking for someone... who...  Everyone is listening to me.
  Later, man.
  Exactly.
