 Q.
 T.
 I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
 Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
 Reeeeally.
||
  Tea.
 You would.
  Oh, I bet you like it.
 Do you like it as much as you like mens butts?
 Because youre gay.
 I need to do mine first. Whos been saying that theres another person inside of me, working me with controls?
 Stay.
 I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesnt need padding." It just didnt add up, Jim.
    Hey, were gonna do this...
 Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didnt hear where.
 Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
 Will you take a check?
 Cool. In the memo line, Im gonna write, "To loves eternal glory."
 Wait til Monday.
 Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
 Totally!
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
 What does a bean mean?
 Michael, what does a bean mean?
 What does a bean mean?!
 What does a bean mean?
 Michael!
 So... youre going to provide them, then?
 What the hell?
 Oh yeah.
 People dont think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but Im going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair.  Its the hair--  Ok. Ok. Im going.  God.
 She thought I was your boyfriend.
 Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
 Im not gay. Im Kevin.
 Yes.
 Are you seeing anyone right now?
 Cool.
 She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
 Yes!
 That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
 Its a good idea.
 Yeah. But thats easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
 What else you got?
 Its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. Pams here.  Pam?
  I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they havent been returned yet.
 Thank you.
 They were stolen?
 What?
  But that was my only pair of shoes.
  Well... well damn-it.
  Okay.
 Oscar.  Angela.
  Im trying to decide if I have time to pee.
  The peeing is fast, Oscar.  Its getting my tie back on.
  Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
  Who would want it?
  What an awesome party.  The best wedding Ive ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.    Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I cant even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
 Jims gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
  Hello.
 Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
 Um, yes.  Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
 Six-six-five-zero.
 Wait a minute. Yes I am.
 No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
 No-
 Shoot.
 I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
 Oh God. I wouldnt last in jail Oscar. Im not like you.
 Oh you dont know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
 Because... You would love it.
 Hi Pam, is Jim there?
 Okay, that sounds good. Um, Ill let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
 Cool. Okay.  Bye.
 They have no idea what happened.
 Oooh yeah...  Jim and Pam!
  Shhhh...
   Shhh...
  Whos pickle?
  Yes!  Thats what Im talking about.
   Oh... whered you get that hat?
 That is hilarious.
  Im gonna kill you.
 Yeah. Every single day.
 I dont want people making fun of my weight.
  Enjoying your nut?
 Im not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
 Well stay late.
 Open QuickTime.
 No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. Ive done this.
 Here they come.  Boom!
 Hi.
 Because of sex?
  My moneys on Pam.
  Michael could win.
  Why cant you just agree with me sometimes?
  Were here for the show, Michael.
  No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
   Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
  It smells like throw up in here.
  Whoa, Ill try it.
 Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
 He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
  Yall.
   Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
  Nice.
 That could be a good sign.
  Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
 Michael, I hated the twirl.
  Check it out, guys. Theres a limo down here.  Michael, look. Oh, man.
 Does and email count?
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Jim said that?
 Jim said that?
 No, no, that makes total sense.
 I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
 Look who it is!
 Congrats Phil!
 Michael its me, Kevin. Phyllis says Im too big for her lap.
 When can I sit on your lap?
 Thats really comfortable.
 I dont know. I didnt know you were gonna ask me that.
 I didnt know. Nobodys ever let me sit on their lap before.
 Can you give me some choices? Cause I really dont want to mess up on this list.
 What about if I tell you the things I dont want?
 I didnt even get to tell you what I wanted!
 Awesome.
 Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
 He got scented candles!
  Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 Just cause you have liquid that doesnt make it a toast.
 Hi!
 What, no candy?
 Hi.
 Jo, theres books in my chair.
 Nice!
  I cooked my way through Julia Childs cookbook, and now, Im halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edwards corn flake chicken.
  Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so weve been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
  I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
  I think it should be a surprise.
  For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
  Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
  Stick spicy food up her butt.
  Our ultra feast menus theme  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
  Im petrified.
    Ta-da!
  Yes!
  Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
  Erin, would you have lunch with me?
  Yes!
  Bye.
  Hi.
  She touched my shoulder.
  No.
  Yes.
  Hi.
  Yeah, me too.
  Really, really fun.
  Yeah, me too.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  You said she liked me.
  Ive dumped better than Erin.
  Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
  Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
 Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
 Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us dont have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
 Oh Im in.
 You are never going to find them.
 Im going to enjoy this.
  Im still enjoying  it.
 Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
 No, dear god, no, its in the trash can. In the kitchen.
 What -
 Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
 Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Yeah!
Oh, I missed you so much.
Yeah!
Waaah!
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-whats fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Waaaah!  Waaaaah! Mommy!
Yeah!
 Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. Im not falling for that.
 Man, Darryl, Im sorry.  Happy Birthday.
 Theyre making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like theyre making fun of me.
  Oscar, did you eat some of my M&Ms? The level...
 Thank you.  It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
 Im not crying.
  Do my hands feel sweaty to you?
 Yeah.
 Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I wouldve told you.
 So if you need anything, Im right over there.
 "C" is for suspension.
  Uh guys, Im now going to apologize for the mess that were in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
 "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because Im fancy from Tallahassee."
 I made the most brilliant retaliation video. Its awesome.
 But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
 But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
 Thank you.
  Look at that. Shes totally flirting with him.
  Like that?
 Yeah, Michael, heres a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested.
 Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&Ms all day.
 Well, why dont you shut up!
 I think its over, man.
 Michael, how did it go?
 Ooh.
  Thats hilarious.
  Boi-oi-oi-ing
  Wow. That is crazy.
  Yeah. Thats pretty bad.
  That is a dangerous game, friendo.
  Why not your condo?
 No.
 Jo, I think that I know what happened.
 Well, now I think I might not.
 Wait, are they searching all our computers?
 No, thats cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. Im a runner.
 Well, I think that the real question is Who is the whistleblower?
  No, it does not!
