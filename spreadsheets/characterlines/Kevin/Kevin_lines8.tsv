 Here, Im gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
 Good old Kevin. Hell do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
 Damn!
  OK, Im not gonna make it. Im turning back.
 Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
 Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
 Right. My mom-
 So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
 I think were ready to give thi-  Jim?
 Here...
 Oh hey guys.
 OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now its cool cause we found another use for them.
 No Jim, tell em what a name is.
  SeÃ±or Loadenstein. Tell em why its called that, Jim.
 Egons.
 No.
 However its normally done.
 Yeah Jim, whys it so far?
 Back...
 That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
 No no no!
 Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
  I understand.
 I think this thing is broken.
 Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
 What?
 Oh, OK. Whats the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
 The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
 Its been out for ages, man.
 Jim, put it on.
 Come on, the Three Amigos.
 Im only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that dont exist like ghosts or mummies.
 Yeah prank
  Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
 Exactly.
 Nooo!
 Thank you.
 Im on it.
 Good thinking.
 Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
 What does this mean? What does it mean!
 Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
 Yeah.
 Guys come on. Im right here.
 Isnt it supposed to be, "Drive safely"?
 Yes!
 Hey, screw you!
 Were called Kevin and the Zits.
 I have a tambourine.
 Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
 We all got to go sometime.
  Dude, youre on TV! Youre the sportscaster on channel seven.
 You do that on TV!
 Guys, Ive got some instruments right here.
 Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
 Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
  Whoo!
 Mm-hmm.
 Are you serious? From Star Trek?
 Yeah.
 Guys, this means theyre Kevin and the Zits now.
 Yes!
 Not food and stuff.
 Oh, if you buy the picnic table then youve got to get the fire pit.
 The fire pit is a no-brainer.
  Okay.
 Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that cause they think A-1s the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? Thats where the eyes go. So...
 Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a for instance.
 Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, Ive seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that...  like, forget it.
 Thank you.
 I dont know.
 Yes.  I am an accountant.
  Never trust a cookie with a womans name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  Theyll just break your heart.
 What?!? No!
 No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  Hes trying to steal it because hes jealous of me.
  Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
 I can do that.
 Your arm feels good on my back.
 For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. Its not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But Im flexible.
 How can we do that? Shes simply wonderful.
 Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But Im gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Dont. Know.
 Hey, man.
 How ya holdin up...because of your wife leaving you?
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Oh yes.
 Good cookie.
 This.
 Hey! I can make that error.
 No, I-
 Okay.
 How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
 Ron Artest, Kelly.
 Nicely done!
 Oh yeah!
 Three hundred pounds!
  Les Jolies Choses.
 Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
 Look, I know its easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but heres a piece of trivia a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
 Lets just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
  Riboflavin?
 Thank you.
 Andy, were fine. We dont wanna switch. Were already like, the perfect unit.
 When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well whos laughing now?
 Oh, will we get to see that look?
 Dude, what if, since youre feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?
 Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
 Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
 It was me.
 Whoa.
 Im right here!  Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
 Okay. Watch my toes.
 Thats racist! I dont know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
 Wow!
 Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!
 No!
 Is it black? Cause that would be hilarious.
 You know.
 A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
 Oh, did I win the pool?
 Yeah, Oscars the dad, Im Oscars dad and Angelas my mom.
 Got that, bimbo?
 Hi!
 Phillip is so fat.
 You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didnt prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
 Im going to call him Little Kevin.
 I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
  Little Kevin.
 Extremely, but Im gonna fight through it.
 Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batmans gotta take off his cape.
 Hey!
 Because I feel like that Im in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if theres like a crazy mismatch or something...
 When do we leave?
 Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge?  Hey guys, look at me, Im huge.
 Are those the lyrics?
 One order.
 Dude, you didnt tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
 One order.
 It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery
 Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
 Listen, its important. Youve gotta hear this.
 I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
 Its not a kid on a bike. Its a man in a car.
 Yeah
 Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
 Bye.
 Whether its a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
 Cookies, eh?
  Oh, the springtime thinks that its the best. And fall time thinks that its the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentines thinks that its the best. But gather round, peeps, Ill tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, thats the truth.
 I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
 I do.
 Oh, I definitely do.
  Hey guys, come on. Dont fight over me.
 No. Wait, no. Im buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
 Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar.
 Thats true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Tobys probably in bed with some model.
  This is tough. Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think Ive reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
 No, its not worth it? Thats too bad. Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
 Hungrier.
 Hungrier.
 Oh yeah, Im talking triple digits.  Again.
  Go.
 Perfect! Now people will think Im doing hot girls all day.
 Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
 What do you mean?
 No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. Ill do anything.  Im even gonna kiss Meredith.  That is... hmph... thats ah... so good.
 Nice.
 When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
 I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, â€œLook, a balloon.â€
 oooh
 Huh. Yeah, thats weird. Hes usually here by now. Right guys?
 Hot tub party?
 I do.  Come on everyone...
 Come on Jim, youre killing her!
 None taken.
 Shh, here she comes!
 You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
 Welcome home.
 Yeah.
  Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. Shes sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
  Get lower.
 Dwight couldnt get it up for Nellie?
 Tip-top shape.
 Ooh, ooh!
 Yeah. Man, youre insane right now. Ravis the whole package.
 Yeah, man, hes absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
 because he fired you which means apparently youre living in your car now.
 Wait, what? Youre going to the fundraiser tonight? Thats going to be weird.
 Its going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
 Hey, I hear you! I hope youre right. It just seems like its going to be really, really weird.
 Oh man, this is weird!
 Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No ones raping this guy!
 No! It was my idea to not be raped!
 Whoa, Dwight, I dont think you understand.
 So Dwight doesnt understand silent auctions. I guess hes the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didnt have one!
 Im sorry, are you guys nuts? Hes not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
 No. No hes not.
 Youre welcome!
 Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
 My dog Ruby doesnt do anything, she just lays there all day! Shes so chill.
 Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. Shes so dainty!
 Doesnt really poop. Its perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
 She smells horrible. Its unbelievable. But I dont want to put her in the bath, because Im afraid that shell drown.
 People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess theyre just jealous, right!  Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
 The branch closed. Forever.
 Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you.  Ooh!
 Wait, C-R-A-Z...
 Even I know thats weird.
