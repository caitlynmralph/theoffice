 Do you have any savings?
 Michael, you might lose your condo.
 Me, me, me, me, me me.   Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
 Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
  Hey! Hey!
 Account...? Michael, what is going on?

 All right.
 Cool.
  Hey Ryan, you coming?
 Awesome. Lets go, Phyllis.
 Michael, I didnt get a gift bag.
 Can I have your pencils?
 Oh, yes I can.
 In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
 This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh!  Shoot.
 The beef is poisoned?

 Hmm. Martin?
 Wait, why am I a racist?
 He is black... right? And...

 Cool.
 I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
 You got outdoors time?
 Michael, why dont we get outdoors time?
 I would so rather be in prison.
  Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
 The tires look pretty worn.

 Angela.
 That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
 Are you sure? It is a big deal.

 How much did you win?
 I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
 Thanks, so sweet.
 Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
 Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.

 Is everything ok, Michael?
 Hey Pam.

 No, it is definitely under one of these hands.
 No, it is here.
 Good thing you didnt listen to me.

 I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. Thats all Ive ever wanted.
   And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If youre gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right."  You got to know when to hold em, know when to fold em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when youre sittin at the table. Therell be time enough for countin when the dealins done.
 Are you going to try it?
 Angela, it is a million degrees.
 Why dont you go Michael?
  Hey.
 Whats different about you? You look worse.
 So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
 Pam is taller.
 Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
 I think Karen has a prettier face.
 Well I mean Pams face is really pretty too. Its a very tough call.
 Yeah.
 Will do.
 Do you think its gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
 What?
 Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
 I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
 Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
