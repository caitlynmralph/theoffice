 No, its fine.
 That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, lets do that.
 No, Im not gay.  And I dont understand why anyone would think, that Im gay... if...  Uh... yeah Im gay.
  Yes Im super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
 Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
 What are you doing?!
  Yes Im gay.  And I didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
 No one else in this office is gay.
  You sound pretty defensive Michael.
  I think the problem with this office is that
  I dont think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
 I would rather not.
 No, NO!  I dont want to touch you, ever consider that?  Youre ignorant, and insulting, and small!
  Michael... Im sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on.
  I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I wont sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
   What are you doing?!
 Too soon.
 Hey, everyone.
 Oh, thats very funny.
  Hi, Angela.
 The one of all women?
 Because Im gay?
 OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. Ill join. Id love to. Thats -- thank you.
 I really have no preference. We dont even have to have a party.
 Michael --
 Why dont you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
 Actually, yeah. I didnt think I would, but turns out --  its great.
 It reminds me a lot of the Three Amigos with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
 Youre the one who said we needed more culture.
 Its her first try.
 Meaning what?
 Well, those arent Pams strong points.
 Angela, Roys check.  Hes coming in later to pick it up.
 It was crazy.
 Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roys by reception and you could just tell hes gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwights standing there like an action hero.
 It was insane!
 What are you guys talkin about?
 Really, ten?  Thats your guess?  Youre a professional accountant.
 Forty-two.
 Thats really not our job.
 I wonder how many phone calls youre missing while youre teaching us to answer calls.
  Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
  Yes.
 I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
 Still said it, so...
 I dont wear a Speedo, Michael.
 What?
 Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh...
 Turkey is a healthy meat.
 If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. Im kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. Well see.
 Hey, Pam Ive been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship.
 Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
 Michael...
 Im sorry, that just doesnt make sense.
 Youre not sure that you have the job.
 Good luck, you guys!
 Oh, Michaels not going anywhere.
 Do you really think hes qualified for that job?
  Mm.  Yeah.
 So ten
