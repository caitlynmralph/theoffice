  That piece doesnt go there.
 No, Im a dog person.
 Those guys always change back, Angela.
 Definitely no.
 But your mouth is bleâ€”
 You know what? I will take Comstock.
 Ill come by after work and pick him up.
 Cest la vie.
  Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
  Next question for our oldie-weds-
 Pams first celebrity crush.
 Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
 Im so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
 Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
 Im just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
 Well, if theres another explanation, I dont really see what it could possibly be. Iâ€”
 Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
 Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family wereâ€”slave owners.
 Is this like a blooper reel?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
 It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area  Especially if theyre poorly insulated. Dwight.
  No six after the eight, no....
 Shh!
 Six.
 Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
 What if it were salads?
 Dwight!
 Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!
 What?
 I dont know what youre talking about.
  Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
 Role call.
 Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
 Actually Im the electoral college.
 I, uh, huh, just
  Can you guys come with me for a minute?
 I know you saw me with the Senator. I think Im in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why?
 Kevin, listen to me. Im in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
 Can you do this, Kevin?
 I dont know what that means. Hey, hey-
 Perfect.
 Kevin!
 That actually wasnt the worst cover. Id say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
 Thats a tough one.
 Im in big trouble.
 Its clearly not an accounting mistake.
 So...
 Well, youve gotta do what youve gotta do.
 I hope thats it, Kevin.
 Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
 Oh, youre right Im so sorry. Snack machine on me.
 Those figures I gave you? Theyre false.
 I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
 Yes, hes innocent.
 What are you talking about? I just did this now.
 Sure.
 Thats gotta be tough.
 Well, I am sorry Kevin.
 No.
 You know what? Im sorry. I overreacted. Because Im stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Whos not stressed out? Whos not stressed out? Who-
 U..s..a. U-
 I have to say Im impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
 Hi.
 More like fall cleaning.
  This doesnt... Im sorry. Wha... what?
 I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angelas husband spoon me back to bed.
 Oh, Im sure ...thats nothing.
 Angela, Blakes also a guys name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
 I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
 From you. Im sure its probably nothing. But whats with the yoga already?
 And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
 Angela, Ill go with you.
 Angela!  Angela. There.
  On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
 Shes repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
  Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.
  Please. Its Robert whos enjoying it.
 This could be the affair that youre scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are.  But uh, hes probably not gay. Hes straight. Hes straight, so...
 I dont know, Angela. Im dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
 Hes making a phone call.
||
 Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that Im having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if shes cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, its business as usual.
 Good morning.
  Of course, ask me a que-- Â questions.
  Yes, a little bit.  Yes.
 Its the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So Im gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. Ill just go downstairs.
 No, thank you, Angela.
 She doesnt know. I shouldnt be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
 I brought you a cookie.
  I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, were good. Yeah.  We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
 What?
 What are you doing?
 Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
 I dont know what youre talking about.
 I got it.
 What the hell, Dwight?
 you are incorrigible!
 You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
 What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
 Angela, until you face that, youre gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I wont stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
 Angela, its a lead freaking pipe.
 Aah!
 Im so sorry. Angela--
 Yeah, lets not blame her for something we all forgot.
 I didnt realize how many of Angelas opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
 Just take her name off of everything.
 How would anyone even know--
  This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany."
  "His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface."
 Ow! You hit people with that thing?
 Pam, really? Come on.
 I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
 I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
 Wow.
 Youre a saint, Pam.
 Yeah, yeah, sure. Id love to..
  Angela.
  Ow!
 Youre waterboarding me!
 I guess so.
 Hey, look whos back, Dwight Junior.
 My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
 Actually, its pronounced â€œespressoâ€ Wait. Thats what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So
 Try this one.
 You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
 YOLO!
 Its a thing. It means â€œyou only live onceâ€.
 Well
 Yes!
 Thats enough Kevin.
 Thats enough!
 Its insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
 Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why dont we move the copier into the annex like weve always wanted to?
 Huh?
 One, two, three!
 Wait!  Its beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
 Kevin, move. I cant pull up the rug if youre standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
 Everybody shut up and work!
  Kevin, can-
 Annex. It must open something in the annex.
 What?
 Aw.
 â€œLoyalty pledgeâ€?
 People, its 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
 Ill watch it. Lets get this over with.
 Oh.
 User error. Ive heard of that happening to other people.
 Just â€“ I dont wanna make assumptions based on peoples physical appearances.
 Yeah, but Jim, Dwights a weirdo. We cant blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
 Just â€“ I dont wanna make assumptions based on peoples physical appearances.
 Yeah, but Jim, Dwights a weirdo. We cant blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
  Angela. Youre going to find out, so I thought Id let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
 He said he wanted me there for support.
 Angelas husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today.  Me.
 Pam, what can be done?
 I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
  That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
 One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
 Yeah.
 Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he couldve invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelios Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
 He put me here.
 Ow! Robert?!
 Yes. Sorry about that.
 Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
 All right, itll be easy. Dont be nervous, just follow my...
  Hi. Wed like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
 We are together. Romantically.
 What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
 So, youre concerned about peoples long absence from their place of work?
 A quarters three months. Thats how long youve been gone.
 Youre clearly snooping.
 Thats her private property.
 Andy. That is her private property.
 You could all be doing this, just saying.
 I watch way too many ads online and I dont do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
 Ill tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, thats how you win. Alright  Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
 Can someone please help me?
 Just- People! Im not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens Ill be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me?  I- Hey! Im not going anywhere! Ill be right here! Oh thats not good.  Hey guys! Ive got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
  Oh, thank god.
 Im so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
 I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I shouldve kept my mouth shut. Were not even that close. Ive only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
 You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
  Who is that?
 You have a brother?
 Theyre a descriptive people.
 Who is that?
 Dwight has a sister?
 Shes beautiful.
  Thats it for me.
 Toby, how do you propose that we-
 Theres a promo for the new documentary on the web.
 Hey guys, I just found another promo. Its in Danish. I guess its gonna start airing in Denmark.
 Dumpster Man.
 â€œThree PM Girlâ€
 It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
 Are you kidding me? Its like half the show is secret footage.
 Meredith!
 Yes, Erin. They film us at night when were sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
 Im sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
 I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  Youre not going to use any of that, are you?
 Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
 They caught us kissing on Halloween.
 Oh!
 Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
 Well, I dont like giving him bad news.
 You call him!
 Stop hitting me!
 No!
 Oh you?
 Hey, Hey Robert!
 Hey.
 Um the documentarys going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
 Very much so.
 Absolutely.
 Hey, I get the sense youre gonna be outed as gay.
 I think thats it!
 Done!
 Ok!
 Our office has an unusually large number of unusually large people.
 So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
 What?
 â€œThe Office An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scrantons own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!â€
 He knew!
 You did it, Kevin.
 What?!
 Why wouldnt you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
 But you just!
  Is everything ok?
 Thatsâ€”thats awful, Angela. Im so sorry.
 Angela, you still have your son.
 I cant say we didnt see it coming. But its a sad day when anybody is fired. Were so sorry, Andy.
 No, I dont think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also cant make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
 Hey, I didnt get a chance to say it, but congratulations, Dwight.
 Good night, Kevin.
 Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
 Wait a minute. Youre not thinking of living in aâ€”
 Okay, Im just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
 Come stay with me.
 I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which wont be long. Its the least I could do.
 Separate bathrooms.
 Youre welcome. Lets go get Phillip. Then well get your stuff
 And get you the hell outta that place.
 Oh, Angela.
 No, its neat and tasteful, like most gay mens homes. The stereotype holds up.
 Angela, you just wereâ€”
 I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. Youâ€”you cantâ€”
 Angela, someone wants you.
 Angelas divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that its Angela whos living in the closet. Hey-o.
 Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
 Why?
 Hi, buddy.
 I cant believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
 Why didnt you pack the apple snacks?
 Seriously, Kevin. Im just gonna have to go to the store.
 Did we ever have lunch together, justâ€”just the two of us? You know what, Im gonna make reservations right now at Cuginos.
 Here, use my pen.
 He just wont go down. Its as if hes excited by all this paper.
  Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanleys sleeping. You dont want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
 Well, hes calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
 Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I dont know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
 Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
 Okay, I guess, its just that Phillip got you something.
 I think theres, like, $7 left.
 Sure.
 Easy.
 Hey, no.
 No horseplay.
 Ok, Ive got myâ€”
 All right, Meredith.
 See you there.
 Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mothers, and Ill meet you at Poor Richards in an hour.
 She doesnt know Im living with a straight woman. I dont want to get her hopes up.
 Oh, my goodness.
 One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
 Ooh.
  Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arbys. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, youhold on.
 Thats the reason Kevin got fired. Its his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight,  â€œA mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.â€ He was home by 445 that day.
 Youre back?
 Whoo, whoo, whoo.
 Yeah!
 They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clichÃ©. Im a man. So Im going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
 WASSUUUUP!
 Yeah, brosef.
 Well, I bet it was a smash.
 Is that a volunteer program or
 If you want her to leave, just tip her.
 What is that?
 Thank you David.
 You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. Its not much. But if you see it in the right wayAnd thats what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldnt once show me doing my origami.
 Why do you say that?
 Yeah, but youre not gay. Youre not gay.
 Youre not gay.
