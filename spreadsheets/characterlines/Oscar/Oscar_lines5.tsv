  All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
  OK.  Stanley, come on.
  Hey, if youre into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
  Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? Hes a catch.
  Im gay!
  Whats the joke?
  Oh, you think its a choice?
  Im messing with you, Holly.
  OK.
  Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
  OK.
   Oh!
  So how was your date?
  Oh my God, what happened?
  Because its your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
  I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, "I say, I say, I say, Ill sit on you!"
  How was Friday night?
  Hell call.
 I thought you were already engaged.
 That isnt ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
 Exactly, Andy.
 Pass.
 Ok, once in a while Ill take a long lunch.
 Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriends unborn sperm bank baby?
 Shes got an Orbit; thats a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
 Me too.
 Great, they stole my laptop.
 How does that even compare?
 I dont want to talk. I want my laptop back.
 So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we dont want. Who would ever come to this?
 100 dollars.
   Whoa. Awesome.
 Here.
 Im good.
  Andy brought one too.
 I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one?
 Ill check us in.
 Im probably going to leave after one drink.
 Nice to meet you.
 Yes.
 Michael, why?
 How do you even know theyre gay?
 Dont do this.
 What are you doing?
 If you dont mind me asking---
 Okay.
 Its just that Ive sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
 How could anyone stand that woman?
 What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
 I want to know.
 You havent had sex?
 Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
 Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
 Id like to know.  You should call her and ask her. Id like to know whats wrong with her.
 Do it! Its a--- Call her!   Oh my God, dont call her! Dont call her, Andy.  Andy, dont call her!
 Why wont you do Andy?
 Hey.
 Yeah, it was.
 Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
 I cant believe we called her up.
 Im talking about Angela. I cant believe we called her up last night.
 You--- you call--- you called her.
 Alright.
 Okay.
 Good morning, Michael.   Are you ready for the meeting?
 Mmm...
 What is first base with Angela?
 I had a good time too.
 Thank you.
 No.
  "To whoever made the microwave mess the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed."
 No kidding.
 The note.  So "holier than thou".
 Here are our final actual costs for this year.
 As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
 Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
 Right there.
 You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
 But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next years budget.
 Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
 So you have an extra dollar.
 So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
 And you ask them for money, theyre gonna give you nine dollars. Cause thats what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
 We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or itll be deducted from next years budget.
 We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
 No, no, please. Please do not do this.
 Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
 Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
 So Michael, what do you think?
 Michael?
 Im just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
  Stop it! Michael.
 The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael.
 Thats the original.
 Do you know?
 I think you know.
 Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
 Whyd you say dollars?
 Whats 15% of 200?  Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
 Youre gonna get us a copier then?
 Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
 You are a smart guy. I know youll do the right thing.
 Hey, were going with the chairs.
 I just figured Id rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
 Were back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
 What about February 2nd?
 Now? Its our Christmas party.
 Do you know how to do an intervention?
 Where did you get this?
 Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
 Thats impossible.
 What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
 Are you serious? Ugh. Where?  Where?  Where, Dwight?
 That was good... Its just, at the end you werent saying something that could also apply to the form.
 There you go.
 You said that yesterday.
 This is nuts.
 Mm-mm. Its 410, I dont think hes gonna show.
 The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
 Kevin, cmon.
 See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? Thats a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
 Thats the thing about debating, youre just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place.
 Ah! My hand!  Thats hot!
 Stay alive!  Im getting help!
 Youre too heavy!
 Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
 Thats offensive.
 I consider myself a good person. But Im gonna try to make him cry.
||
 Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
 That reeks, and Im trying to eat.
 Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday.
 Wow.
  Oh, my desk is over...
  Two?
 Angela, youre more chipper than usual.
 Whered you get that kind of money?
 You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
 It could be snacks, or-
 Wha-
 Good God!
||
||
 Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?
 I have no idea.
 I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, Im pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
 TV.
 I dont think so.
 I cant.
 Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
 I was stupid, I told him.
 He told me he wasnt gay.
 Im not done yet.
 Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
 Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
 Hes on one of his honeymoons.
 He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so hes just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today hes hot air ballooning and later hes got a couples massage.
 Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
 Its possible.
 We can stay a little longer.
 Come on, well all go.
 Ten percent?
 Theyre our largest client.
 Its gonna hurt.
 They can.
 Yes, they can.
 Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
 These arent announcements.
  Do you have specifics?
  Well, its-
  Dunder Mifflin.
  At least he is in the building.
  I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.   But I dream... so...
  Thats a lot.
||
  You put a note in my food?
   Just to say "sterile" doesnt make it so.
   Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
  You need those things.  Most new businesses, they dont make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you dont cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
  Five years?
  Its just not prudent Michael.
  I cant believe this is really happening.
  And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone.
 Phyllis, Phyllis.
 Use it in a sentence.
 Try another sentence.
 I dont know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
 Why dont you just ask him--
 What have you been doing?
 Nothing.  I didnt say anything.
 Im sorry youre offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
 No.
 I dont think so.
 Meredith, your boob is out.
 Please dont refer to yourself as our daddy.
 Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
 What happened to Phyllis?
 You invited someone?
 Ive been here 8 years and Ive never...  Rude.
 Settle down gentlemen.
 Dwights right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
