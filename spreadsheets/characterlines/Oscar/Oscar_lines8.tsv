 Oh, for Gods sake.
 Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. Thats it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
 Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
 Good night Andy.
 I-
 I know.
 Ill start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
 No, guys.
 Hes fine.
 Hes making a statement. Its an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
 â€C-SPANâ€?
 Let me call you back.
 Can you believe this?
 You cant leave a dog in a parked car.  Snowboarder, it figures.
 I bet this guy didnt leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
 This guys been gone long enough. Hes lost his right to a window.
 Come on buddy, get back.
 And one for good measure!
 Why would we take the dog?
 Jim, hes not gonna star-
 Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
  There we go. That should do it.
 What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
 At least.
 Really, nobodys gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
 Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent.
 Bulk or definition?
 Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
 Oh, hes plenty strong.
 It used to be Reggie Winters out at Golds Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
 Its really not.
 Andy, we understand basic table manners, were not children.
 Andy, stop hovering, youre being really annoying.
 Wow.
 Technically FOR Robert California. Hes our CEO.
 Guess we found Andys rosebud.
 Its a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
 Different school of thought. Lets just agree to disagree.
 Narddog.
 I cannot believe how condescending Andys being.
 I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
  What happened, Pam?
 Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
  Hey guys.  Im an Oscar  liar  weiner.
  Is that my grandmother?
 There is no story.
 Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
 Hmph.
 Meredith, dont.
 Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, theres some sort of real phenomenon out there...
 Theres an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. Ill send an order down to shipping before weve received payment.
 When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And its powered by thai food and spanish reds.
 Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
 Nuh uh.
 Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
 Andy.
 Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
 Why havent we heard anything? Its 445. Theres only 15 minutes left.
 I made a mistake. Im sorry.
 Its not that funny.
  He stopped it!
 Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
 No, no. Not even.
 Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
 In this case yes.
 Its not fair, you guys.
 Good luck!
 Actually it is the northernmost.
 Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
 Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesnt know any better.
 Really? Why dont you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
 hes a historian.
 Yes, yes, yes!
 Yes!
 Argh!
 What?
 Erin-
 I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
 Dwight â€“ this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
 Yeah.
 Youve heard about it?
 Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
 Youre right.  There should be a monument to this.
 Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
 And thats how the printing press was invented.
 Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
 All I need is another gym. As if I dont have enough drama.
 Whos spotting who? Dont use the bike in the corner. Thats Bruces. Jeremy says
 Andy, if he didnt want her working here then why did you hire her?
 How mean are we talking about?
 Thats Gerald.
 Yeah, hes in a ladle.
 He did it himself.
 Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
 Its not that kind of ladle.
  Ah, just the battery on these things. Im sorry, Ive got to recharge this.
 You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
 Kevin?
 Yes!
 Wow.
 Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
 No!
 Thats no accident.
 What?
 What? I havent bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
 Dwight.
 Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
 Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
 Andy, no-
  Aw...
 Im leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
 Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
 Its only the biggest night of trivia of the year. Theres a thousand dollar prize. Im committed to my friends, theyre committed to me.
 I dont believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
 What? No!
 And you guys thought this was a good idea?
 Yes! Its a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
 What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think youre going to win your sales quota? At a gay bars trivia night?
 Good luck.
 Salman Rushdie.
  Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
 No! Come on!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
 It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
 Oh, who needs a house that size?
 Kevin, no.
 That was you, Kevin.
  Holy cow!
 How many bottles? Three hundred?
 Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
  To the kitchen!
 Toby, whats compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
 Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
 To both these bears.
  Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
  Oh, Mineral-ey.
 Well no one won the pool. Angela wasnt due for another month.
 Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
 We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
  Guys, I dont know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I dont know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. Its going to be really tiny, so please dont say anything offensive.
 Knock, knock. Oh!
 We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
 Kevin!
 Wow, its so... healthy.
 Oh yeah, I dont know if its right, but-
 Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
 This baby is clearly not premature. Theyre lying about the date it was conceived. Its very interesting. And her husbands gay. I dont even know which thread to follow.
 Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
 The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
 Angela.
 I knew that, I knew it.
 Chicken marsala.
 Mm-hmm.
 Dwight. Hey.
 He went to the car or something, but hell be back.
 Dont you want to see the baby?
 I promised I wouldnt tell.
 Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
 She got pregnant before the wedding.
 A month.  You didnt hear it from me!
 Angela, you look amazing.
 It just feels like a slap in the face.
 Were not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
 ...Andy.
 Can we see that? Did you really find it?
 Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
 Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
 Its maddening!
 Exactly. Thats just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
 Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
 Un-be-liev-a-ble.
 Andy.
 Order reference number 00983-126.
 Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
 Terrific.
 Good job Andy.
 How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
 Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
 Youve gotta be kidding me.
 No, Kevin --
 With all due respect we know what were defending against a twelve year old female bully.
 You guys, weve gone over this, there is no treasure.
 When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure.  Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. Theres nothing in there.  Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, Im Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
 I am dying to know whats in there.
 We knew. Ryan told us.
 I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
 Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. Im not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
 Actually, Nellie, this monologue youre delivering is very offensive.
 What does that mean?
 Shes always late, shes always rude...
 Yeah.
 Listen to this.
 Were in far too deep. We cant change course at this point.
 What I mean to say is we dont want to.
 Plus everyone would know who you meant.
 To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
 Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
 Yeah.
 Times almost up. How many are left?
 Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
 What is this?
 Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravis way better.
 Oh, come on.
 Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
 It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. Its on CNN as of two minutes ago.
 Whats going on?
 my dog Gerald is my life.
 This confirms three things Im right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
 I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
 I know!
 We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
 Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
  So?
 This is interesting.
 He does not think Jims gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
 sorry about what? Theres nothing to be sorry about here.
 No. Im certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. Id have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
 Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
 okay
 why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
 Why did Binghamton close?
  Hello. My names Oscar. Im an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Im gay. And Im here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
 No, its just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, theres a brighter future ahead.
 No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
 Do you not own a mirror?
 Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, its a simple-
 Its not misleading.
 In any case, it gets better.  Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
 What?
 David Wallace hasnt worked here in years.
 Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
 Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
