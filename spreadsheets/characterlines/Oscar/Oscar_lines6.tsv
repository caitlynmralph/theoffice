 I bet theres something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
  I did. Yes.
 What?
 Are you attracted to other men?
||
 If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
 Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I dont... you might be gay. You might be gay.
  What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That cant possibly fall to me.
  What? You think Im the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
 Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanleys affair, me being a spokesdog...
   You wanted to see me?
   Yeah sure.
   Is everything okay?
   Im sure everything will be fine.    What do you? Whats the procedure, if you dont mind my asking?
   Okay.
    Oh my God.
   Yeah.
 Look, it doesnt take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesnt have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
 Thank you, Jim, for thinking that were smart people.
 Excellent question, genius. Its because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
 Well?
 Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks youre smart?
 Exactly!
 We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
 We would just like to know whats happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
 Again, that gives us no information.
  Just--
 What the hell?!
 Someone please explain it to Kevin.
 Pleased to meet you.
 You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
 Him? Him?
 You owe me and apology.
 Its not a good idea. Theres no such thing as a good hairpiece.
 Oh...
   What are you doing?
  How long do you take to pee?
  Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
 Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean Im in the mob?
 For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
 Uhh. All right, who else is here?
 Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So theres not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has mentally checked out since June. Its a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak.
 What? What?
 Its, its a completely different name!
 No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
 Jim? Its Oscar. Im so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
 Its Michael, he thinks hes being shaken down by the mob. I dont know how you usually handle this.
 Pam, Im sorry--
 Youre right. Youre right.  Oh, okay bye.
 Why would you cancel Jims credit cards?
 This constitutes identity fraud.
 Whats that supposed to mean?
 Why would I love jail?
 Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
 Just- no.  No.
 Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
  Hold on, hold on, whats going on?
  You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
  Maybe youre right, who are we to...
  Hey.
  Pam, just for the record, I think youre overreacting a little bit, your moms old enough to make her own decisions.
  My mothers in a wheelchair.
 Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
 Dont you mean Koi Story?
 Oh my. That is small.
 Can you breathe okay?
 When is the funeral?
 Kevin.
 How can we not watch this?
 It starts on its own. Let it -
 Oh. Did - did you see that?
 Jim, you let Michael fall in.
 Jim, I think Im in your way.
 Andy bought lunch.
  Its not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
  How?  He cant hit back.
  I found the article.   "On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflins.  It is rumored that they will recommend... " and the article cuts off.
  Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe theyre just restructuring to get out of debt.
  Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
  Its my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
  I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
 Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
   This plantation, were running low on greenbacks.  Were having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We cant pay...  - Michael, I cant - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so its cause for concern.
  Youre not gonna answer the phone?
  Not again.
 The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and theres no where to get it.
 Those are the bullet points.
 Thats as simple as I can make it.
 This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
 The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because thats what youd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
 Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall.  Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
 Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
 These questions are bush league.
 Ummm...
 Ok
 Um..
 I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
 I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
 Michael, I didnt ask to come up here.
 What?
 For me.
 You -
 Sure.
 Are you kidding me?
 Hey, Rockefeller Center!
 They finally let you do it!
 Thats funny.
 Thats too funny.
 There he is.
 Is Matt around? I got his check.
 Ah, Ill just... wait for him.
 Ill just leave it here with you.
 Who?
 Is it that obvious?   No- hey...
 Okay Pam.
 Nice to meet you Mark!
 Right, Matt.  I know what Im doing, Pam.
 I think you dont know what youre saying.
 I think we can do it.
 Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
 Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
 But I banked six weeks.
 Michael. Reading.
 The Atlantic.
 I should step into sales myself.
 Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
 Manual.
 What are we, five?
  Thats fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
  The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
  Congratulations.  Thats great.
 I have a question.
 In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
 Im in.
 No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
 Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Hey. Matt, right?
I always come in at 7.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there.  Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Hey, nice office.
You know what we havent done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Didnt we? I think we did.
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
So happy hour.
All right.
So what do you think?
I know.
I couldnt understand a word he said.
Maybe youre right. I should count myself lucky.
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Sure. Hoops!
Hoop it up, right.
 Erin? I think were out of fax cover sheets.
 Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
 Why didnt you do Oscar the Grouch?
 El telefono.
 Michaels having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um...  I should have been more specific.
 Your office is full of genitalia.
 "Thats what he says?"
 I dont see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
 Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
 Michael, hes right. You are turning into a stalker.
 Dwight, we know Kelly applied. Were not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
 Its not a signal. Its just a coincidence. No, its not even a coincidence. Its just something that happened.
 That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
  All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
  Why would you throw something wet at me?
  How can you live with yourself?
 Whats number one?
 The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
