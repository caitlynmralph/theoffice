 Michael, theres a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
 Its not pizza.
 Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"?
 Because were looking up jail time.

 Obviously its a real word, but I dont know when to use it correctly.
 Hes not even good at his first one.
 Michael, are you having money problems?
 You heard me correctly.
 Not at all.
 Hey, I just wanted you to know that you cant just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
 Still, thats not anything.
 This is a lot of credit card debt.
 Mmm.
 Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
 Twelve hundred dollars.  Whats a Core Blaster Extreme?
 Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
 The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
 This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
 Michael, Im going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.

 Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?

 Ahhh!
 Ok.
  "Lets be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so lets celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool.
 No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
 Why dont you just have an apple?

 Hey, Jim.
