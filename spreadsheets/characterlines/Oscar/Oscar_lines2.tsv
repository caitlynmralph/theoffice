 The Dundies are kind of like a kids birthday party, and you go, and theres really nothing for you to do there. But the kids having a really good time, so youre, kind of there. Thats-thats kind of what its like.

 Are you going to tell Michael?
 Hey, Michael.
 Hey, Dwight.
 What happened in Michaels office was wrong.  I understand it , it makes sense   But it... it was still wrong.
