 The coffees supposed to be here at 9.
 He messed yours up to.
 Michael, thats nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because hes your nephew.
 This is hypothetical. Were talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
 If theres nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
 Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
 Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
 Yep, here they are.
  Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
  Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
  Totally, thats great.
  Great.
  $50,000?
  Thats great.
  Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
 It was an amateur production, technically.
 I dont even wanna know these things!
 Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyones attention, and it seems like youve done it on several occasions.
 Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
 What is this about?
 Yes!
 What?
 We were never lovers!
 Huh?
 I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally cant wait to wake up every morning.
 Yes, it is.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 No, Meredith, thats not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
 Oh...
 You are busy! Were in a meeting!
 Its pandering. And it makes me think you think Im stupid.
 That sounds fake.
 Okay.
 All right. I can do that. Then what?
 Okay.
 Meredith, I-
 Como estas, senor?
 Its hard to judge ourselves accurately, isnt it.
 So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
 Everyone realizes that this coupon book isnt actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? Youd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you dont actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. Im not the only one who sees this, right?
 Thats a great name. Youre hilarious. A plus!
 Guys? Youre arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
 I guess you could say Im still in costume. Im a rational consumer.
 Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? Im a rational consumer.
 I present to you the  rational consumer, as it were.
  ERIN!
 Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
  Michael. Get off the bus.
  That one! Shes been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
 You know what? I didnt read the rules, I didnt know the rules. There, its on. I didnt read the rule book.
 Jim what are you doing?
 Flip it back please.
 Go to the recorded version.
 What?!
 This is why Erin! Were living it! Start recording now!
 Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
 Whats your money situation?
 Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
 Bankruptcy?
 How long do you think a week is?
 Actually, thats not true. I know the figure youre referring to, and its a projection of fifteen years from now.
 Michael, Chinas agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet cha, but still agrarian.
 Come on Michael. You can...
 Where are you getting this information?
 Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
 Great. I was wrong. Im wrong. Is everyone happy?
 Funny Jim. That is funny.
 What is it?
 Alright. Alright I get it.
 Thats print.
 Hes... hes not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
 Hey Michael.
 I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
 Id love to talk more about it.
 Maybe over some coffee later?
 Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that Ive been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
 We have missiles too.
 Actually, were in a mild recession right now. Ill give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
 Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economys heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? Id say thats far more relevant. Wouldnt you?
 Dont worry about the coffee, its on me.
 Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
 What?
 Whats your point.
 Thats not.
 That wasnt what we were discu... That wasnt the whole...
 Heres a question nobodys asking Is this worth it?
 Why?
 State senator.
 Who are you dating in the public arena?
 Well...
 Why would someone hug you?
 Senator, its an honor. Im Angelas friend Oscar.
 Robert seems great. Hes very handsome, firm handshake, hes gay, good sense of humor.
 Merry Christmas to you.
 A real David and Goliath story.
 Ill make it. What are you drinking.
 I dont know how to make that.
 Whos the senator?
 Oh, you mean the state senator. Im sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote the senator.
 Ill get him water.
 It means youre playing someone whos going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"?
 Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a...
 A triple word.
 Or moon.
 Shes stuck on that one thing.
 A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there.
 Put the "q" there, sweetie.
 Put the "q" there!  Sorry I yelled.
 Theres no theater in that.
 Well...
 We got it! Wow! We got it!
 Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
  Ah. No!  . Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have.
 Yes.
 You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and were ok with it. We agree its fine if you got married.
 Which on in particular?
 You suppose?
 "Im suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again."
 Ok. I got one.
 Yes!
 Irony is such a critical...
 Wow.
 Pam, I think Im going to send you an IM.
 Thats tasteless, Gabe.
 Tasteless.
 Whos is it? Who wrote that?
||
 The numbers are correct, Michael.
||
 I jus... I just need a signature.
 Yes! The freaking PDA!
 Thank you! I mean, Im thrilled for them.
 Yes, yes, absolutely.
 So happy. Yeah.
 Kevin!
 Are you guys listening to this?
 Not occasionally. All the time.
 Good.
 Just leave it how you said...
 Okay, this is much worse than before.
 Are you kidding? I wasnt trying to break you guys up.
 Go on. Kiss each other already.
 I just told them to do it!
 Michael hows this supposed to work? Packers gonna keep saying terrible things, and then hes just gonna make half-assed apologies. And were back to square one.
 No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
 Shes the one.
 Wanna know how to do it? Heres how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
 What... Ryan, where did you get this picture?
 No.
 Where was that.
 Will you marry me?
 Michael is leaving. And apparently theyve already hired a new manager. And were meeting him today. Its a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
 You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
 Well, Deangelo, Id say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
 Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
 Michael, This is insane.
||
 Try Jim DeAngelo, hell be able to help.
 The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
 I forgive you for kissing me!
  Its his last Dundies.
 Come on Toby.
 Thank you Michael. Its beautiful.
 State Senator.
 Brava!
  Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
 You have an address yet in Colorado?
 What town do Hollys parents live in?
 These sound like good ideas, why wouldnt we like them?
 No thank you.
 My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
 Ill look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
  Firewall.
 Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
  Angelas engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, Im horrified. As a friend of Angelas, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings,  Im a little excited.  But overall, horrified.
  Pam... I think Robert is gay.
   So!?
  I have a very strong suspicion.
  What bathhouse?
   What?
  My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
  Youre thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older.  You sound ignorant.
  No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
  Is there a front runner?
  Well, there must be someone who stands out.
  Well...
  Are you?
  You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
  Youre right. Youre right. She seems happy. We dont tell her.
  Erin, what are you doing?
  Okay.
  I dont think he meant, that--
  Go ahead.
  Can I say...?
  I think it should be Darryl.
  Kellys on your side.
