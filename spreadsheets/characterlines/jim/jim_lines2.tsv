 So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
 What?
 Oh, I cant because I keep them hidden. I dont want to look at them and get cocky.
 No, its hilarious, youre right. I just think, um, "worlds longest engagement", um, were all expecting it, you know?
 Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
 Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
 Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
 Oh!
 Oh.
 Yeah.
  I think those might be empty.
 Second drink?
  Yeah, alright Kev.
 Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
 What a great year for the Dundies.
 We got to see Ping.   And we learned of Michaels true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life.
 What?
 Okay.
 I dont know, what?
 Oh my God! You are so drunk!
 Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
 Hes a volunteer.
 Dwight come on, come-
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Whoa, careful, careful.
 No you dont.
 Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
 Shoot.
 Not really a question.  Okay, lets get you home, youre drunk.
 Alright.
 Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
 Hey.
 Um... I dont think so.
 Oh! There it is!
 Um... Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.
 Well done.
 Topical.
 Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!
 Except pass that breathalyzer.
 Im really excited to meet your Mom.
 Oh yeah?
 Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
 Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
 Im in an office relationship. Its special. Um... shes nice. Shes shy. Shes actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that youd be on camera. Im sorry, shes European. No, I told you that youd be on camera. Stop it.
 No, thanks. Im good.
 Does that include Thats What She Said?
 Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
||
 Mm-hmm.
 No way. Lets do this  Oh.
 Wind.
 Perfect.
 Oh.
  Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
   What does 2005 season mean?
  Wait a minute, what is this?
  What?
  Really?
  Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
   OH!
  Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
  Why?
  Hey, do you guys have any other games?
  So thats what this sound is all day.
 Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
 Fair enough.
   This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the mens bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
  Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
 Let the games begin.
  You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And Im blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
  Hum.
  Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
  So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
  Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.
 Here we go.  Here we go.
  Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! Its Phyllis!
  Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
  Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
  Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
  Very nicely done. I think thats H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
  Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
  Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
  Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal.
  What?  Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
  Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!
  Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 115.
 Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys?
  Nothing. Guys? Timers still going? Er?
   Here you go. All done.
  Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
  Hey.
  Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
  Okay, today. 5 oclock. Closing Ceremonies.
  Notify the athletes.
  Michael.
  Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
  Nice.
  Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
  These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. Youre on the top one.   Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.
  And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
  Um... Cause your condos in America.
  Those are the doves.
 Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
 So were still on for lunch? Youre meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
 Okay.
 Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So were going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
 And, um...
 Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
 Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
 Nice. Third book?
 Okay. Phyllis.
 Nice.
 I guess.
 Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
 Nice. Smart.
 Okay. Thought people read more books.
 DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
 Wow.
 Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
 Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies youre going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
 Unforgivable.
 Good.
 Pam? Get us back into it.
 Five movies. Go ahead.
 Ooh, definitely in my top five.
 What?
 Okay thats five.
 Pam, play by the rules.
 Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
 All right. Lets move on. Lets move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
 Um, not neccessari...
 Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe Ill... Ill finish explaining the rules. Lets... let me explain it first, and then...
 Yeah, so well get right... You know what? Ill be right back. Stanley, youre taking over for me, buddy. Ill be right back.
 Dwight. Dwight.
 Come on Dwight! Use words.
 Who goes to business school?
 He does?
 What?
 You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
 Yeah. Youre right.
 Alright buddy.
 Nothing.
 Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. Hes really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
  Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. Were just here, were playing Desert Island. Its when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
 Hey.
 Good, how are you?
 Good to see you, too.
 Yeah, I am too.
 What answers?
 Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
 Okay, I think the games over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
 Yeah?
 Sure.
 Im a three hole punch version of Jim. Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
 Oh, yeah.
 Okay, okay...
 Nice.
 Okay, okay. Um, how bout, the ultimate team player?
 Dwight is... special. But, I dont believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craigs List. Were really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
 Um. He sticks to his guns.
 Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? Im gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
 Um... its in Maryland.
  Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.
 Honestly, I dont think Michael has the slightest clue of who hes gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, whats going to happen is its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
 Um... yes.
 Michael, I really didnt mean to...
 Im sorry?
 Oh, you want me to be you?
 Okay.
 Oh, are you firing Creed?
 We should switch seats in order to...
 Alright.  Excuse me. Im really sorry, but I have to let you go. And its purely budgetary. Its not personal...
 Wow.
 Thats an overreaction.
 Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
 Okay.
 Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
  Michael Scott here.
 Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
 It wasnt me.
 Yeah, I know.
  Come on.
 Thats just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that were friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if Im gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldnt blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because its double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
 That is weird.
 Ok, well, youre the one who lost the desk.
 Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
 I think you should retrace your steps.
 Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
  Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
 I know.
 Uh, yeah, ream.
 Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
  Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
 Umm...
 You know what, let me give you a call right back. Im going to uh, find it and then Ill call you back, thanks.
 Was that your mom?
 Oh, I thought it was your mom.
 Assistant to the Sensei, thats pretty cool.
 Ok.
 Uh, Larissa Halpert.
 117 Mount Bergin St.
 You making this up as you go along, arent you?
 Well, at least I dont have cavities.
 Thanks.
 Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
 No Im not.
 Oh, thats not advice. What advice sounds like is this umm, dont ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.
 Ok, say please.
 Please?
 Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
 Ok, Roy?
 Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
 Well, Dwights a purple belt, so...
 Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
 Sounds tough. When youre a Jet,  youre a Jet all the way, right?
 I cant. I just got a manicure.
 Just have Dwight punch you.
 You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
 Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
 Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
 Ok, Ill buy you a bag of chips.
 Obviously.
 Yes.
 Uh, Kitchen.
 Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwights dojo?
 Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, Im coming, fight...
  Wow, that is really interesting.
 Your love line- Im just kidding. I cant see anything.
  Oh, ok.
  Tied up.
 What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
 Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend.
 No.  Theyre in the conference room.
 So this possible client theyre talking about, actually a big deal.  Its Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.   Years.
 No...
 We are doing worst first dates.
 Wait, when was this?
 I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
 Is this real?
 Agent Michael Scarn.
 How long is this?   Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
 Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didnt really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
 Do we all have our copy of "Threat Level Midnight", by Michael Scott?
 Alright, lets get this started.  Im gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
 Oh yeah-
 Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
 Dwight-
 Do you want to play-
 The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
  Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
 Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
 A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn.  Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
 Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
 Thats actually a good idea.  Well all take a brief intermission.   Hey, are you hungry?
 Yeah?
 I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. Im not a complainer.
  Wow.
 Nice.  Thats excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
 So, I guess Ill see you in  ten hours.
 Travel.  Ive been looking forward to it.  Its gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
 Yeah.  Definitely.
 Jan didnt come back for her car last night.
 Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
 No way.
 Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
 Really.
 Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
 Dinner and a show, if you include Michaels movie.   And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
 Youre right, we didnt dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
 Least I didnt leave you at a high school hockey game.
 Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
 Ok, we didnt dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, its not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
 No.  Thank you.
 Done.
 Sok.
 Youre not having sex.
 Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
 Wow.  Um, ok.
 Ok.
 We dont have double-tabbed manila file folders.
 No, we dont.
 Alright... well, Im not asking for a raise. Im gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
 I win.
 Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
 Duh.
 Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that its Friday.  And thats what Ill be working on this afternoon.
 Ohh...
 Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks its Friday.  So, keep that goin.
  Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 1115, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
  ...Saturday, so just let me know what youre doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
 Hey, hows it goin?
 Course, its on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
 No, that was unbelievable.
 I dont really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
 Um, you dont, I dont think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
 Oh-
 Yeah, no, I dont think you can.
 Ummm... no idea.
 Are we in danger?
 What?
 Hmm...
 No.
||
 Uh hum.
 Its true. Im having a party.  Ive got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didnt invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And its nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldnt be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because Im pretty sure he thinks that Im making Dwight up.    He is very real.
 Oh, uh, no. Could-
 Could, keep that down.
 Because not everybody knows about the party.
 Umm, Michael.
 Because its a surprise.
 Uh hmm.
 So, dont tell.
 Ok.
 So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
 I know.
  Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roys gonna come, or...
 Oh, ok, cool.
 Hey.
 Yup, its, uh, four oclock.
 Oh, um... .I cant.
 Uh hmm, definitely.
 You do?
 Because you said "do you wanna hang out"-
 Really?
 Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
 Improv sounds great.
 Alright.
 I think Stanley just coughed.
 Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybodys attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, its not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
 Thats because Marks my roommate.
 Uh hmm.
 Oh, uh, later-ish.
 Great.   Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
 Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
 Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if were lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
 Uh, actually, I havent talked to her in a while.
 We can talk about that later.
 See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  Its-
 This is my desk.
 My home office, this is it.
 Ok, sure. Will do.
 Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
 You know what?  Lets just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
 Yeah, you dont have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, thats not gonna be awkward at all.
 Oh yeah.
 Thank you.
 Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin fun?
 Chicken, hot dog, burger.
 There is soda inside.
 Oh by the way hows your side project going?
 Really?
 So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But Im also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I wont. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
 I think I did a pretty good job.
 Well, I cant tell you cause its a secret.
 Yeah?
 Well, theres a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
 Thats great. Well dont tell me who it is, cause I can ..
 Oh, cool.
 Great. Where did you get it?
 He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag.
 Theres a little more to it.
 What is Yankee Swap?
 I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
 Oh, shouldnt we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
 Sure you dont want the teapot?
 Right.
 No. No. Definitely. Its ..
 Got to be kidding me.
 Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
 I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
 Come on, its a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
 To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, its a little too much to handle.
 You know, you dont have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
 But ..
 Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
 I didnt think you were going to get that one. I really didnt.
 Hey.
 Whats up, buddy?
 Wow, thats weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, thats pretty good.
 Who, Steve?
 Oh, there it is. J1.
 Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
 "Its time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."
 So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
 Yeesh, how old is this ship?
 Im not really sure what movie youre talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
 Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that hes king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
 Its not hilarious, but...
 Um, no.
 Yeah.  Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
 Well...
 Oh, um...
 Um... lets see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
 You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
 No.
 I dont know. Lets break up.
 What happened to you?
 Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
 What a night.
 She was always engaged.
 Thats... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
 Yeah, I know.
 Yeah. Shes really funny, and shes warm. And shes just... well, anyway.
 Shes engaged.
 Huh.
  Yeah, thats right.
 What?
 Whats going on?
 Im sorry? Pam.
 What is going on?
 Hey, whoa, Michael...
 Its, okay, its Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
 You burned
 Oh...
 But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
  What was that...
 Oh!
 He hit the pole!
 Its broken right, he cant...
 Oh Dwight, Dwight,   Ohhhhhh!
 Hes still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
 So, where are you shipping your foot?
 So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
 Do you think Dwights bein a little weird today?
 And that isnt weird?
 Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
 I want to clamp Michaels face in a George Foreman grill.
 You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
 Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because Im pretty sure he has a concussion.
 Fine.
 Slowly, slowly.  Lets just get to the elevator.
 What are you doing?  What, stop...
  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
 You cant lay down.
 Wake up.
 Im just gonna get...
 Just keep him awake.
 You dont think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
 Well, I think she has a kid.
 Come on, get inside.
 Were going to Chuck E. Cheese.
 Were going to the hospital, Michael.
 Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
 Give the bottle to Michael
 Give the bottle to Michael!
  Will you stop?
 Michael stop.
 Michael stop.
 Stop
 Its Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
 Concussion.  What did you write?
 So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
 Come on Dwight.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
 Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
 Michael went in there with him too.  Its pretty sweet.
 Uh huh.
 But they shouldnt be much longer now, so well be back soon.
 Ok.
 Bye.
 Not much whats up with you?
 Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
 Nothin much whats up with you?
  So close.
 Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the worlds worst confidant.
 Hey Michael.
 Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
 Umm, hmm.
 Nobody.
 Alright. Great. Thank you.
 Im going with grape.
 Which one?
 I dont know what you mean.
 Uh, uh, ok.
 Im going to take off actually.
 Tony the tiger.  You dont hear that much any more.
 Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
 Thanks.
 I dont know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
 No, thats alright, thank you though. Its, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
 Oh, ah, no but no. You know what lets go out. That was a good idea.  Lets go out.
 Nope were not brothers.
 Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
 Uh, I really dont want to talk about it.
 Um, shes easy to talk to I guess and shes got a really good sense of humor.
 Uh-huh.
 What about you?
 Wow, thats not what I meant.
 Thank you.
 Thanks, thanks Dana.
  Just you know politics, literature.
 Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I  dont. Riveting.
 Hey.
 Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
 It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
 Big day.
 Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. Its so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
 Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
 And seriously, its totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
 Oh you did?
 No, no, you saw through me, great.
 Oh yeah, yeah... hope thats okay.
 And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
 Ok.
 Hey.
 Umm, what happened?
 Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man its, you know what. Its not a big deal.
 Look its one day, everythings gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
 Good.
 Ready?
 Oh, nothing.
 Pams on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so itll be nice to see her.  Itll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, thatll be nice.  And thats that.
 Oh, nothing.
 Hey!  Welcome back!
 So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
 Good!  Whats goin on here?
 What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
  Oh.  Wow.
 That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
 But theres definitely a desk open in the back.
 ...which I guess Ill be taking.
 No, no, no, seriously, Ill be in the back.
 Hey, Kelly.
 Um, just for the day while Michaels at my desk.
 Allergy to... the desk?
 Its the lever on the side.
 No, I dont think I can...
 Hey!
 Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  Its actually little awkward.
 What do you think of Kelly?
 Are you interested in her?
 Really?
 She said lots of things.
 I have no idea.
 Yeah.  Sure.
  Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  Ill talk to you later. Bye.
 Yep.
 What is?
 Thanks for the heads up, Kev.
 Oh, no, no. No.
 Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
 Yeah. I like talking to her too.
 Yes. Yeah.
 Yep. Cool, man.
 Ponies.
 Flowers.
 Hey!
 Its a complete... well, actually its exactly what youd expect, so... How are the girls?
 Did you really?
 Oh.
 Good.
 Nice. Well, whats it all about?
 I think you should do it. Thats great!
 So youre not doing it.
 Why not?
 Come on.
 Roy said that.
 You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
 You are?
 So I broke up with Katy and havent been dating anybody else, so this year I dont have to worry about Valentines Day. Its gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. Were gonna play some cards and Ill end up winning a lotta money. Because, theyre idiots. Its gonna be great.
 I dunno, its on
 It was there when I sat down.
 Hey Kelly. Whats up?
 OH, thats great. Im really happy for
 Wow.
 Wow.
 No, dont be.
 I bet.
 Alright.
  Nah thats alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. Thats fine. No, I didnt even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
 Take it slow. Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...
  Oh, no, not while Im here.
 You know what? Heres the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? Itd be great, but he isnt.
 Well, hes not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
 Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentines Day.
 Can we not?
 Still want that.
 Cuginos pizza.
 Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
 What did I do to deserve this?
 No.
 Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
 Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
 Im going to take a trip. Im going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
 Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
 Can I go?
 So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where Im going yet. Its kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
 What is that?
 I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
 When did you go there?
 Really for like how long?
 Where do I want to go?
 No. Were not.
 Which means absolutely nothing.
 Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
 Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
 You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
 Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that youve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
 The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
 Youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists. Many times. Its supposed to emphasize your point.
 Ok, I didnt actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
 Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
 Maybe. Thanks.
 Yeah. Im definitely going.
 Im going. Im a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
 I dont know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
 Im... leaving on June 8th.
 Yeah. And Im really sorry about that, I just...
 Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
 Alright.
 Bribery. Nice.
 The ocean.
 What are you reading?
 Aww, best book?
 Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
 Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You dont want to help me with some of my sales, do you? Cause, Im kind of swamped.
 Really?
 Yesss. And youre Abby, right?
 Im Jim.  Annnnd... lets sell some paper.
 Lets start with... your mom.
  Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
 Really? Cause shes pretty strong, Dwight.
 Thats pretty funny.
 Cant believe his mom dressed him like that, thats the real tragedy.
 Ohh, man, I would love to! I cant tonight, but can I come over some other time?
 Thanks, Kev. Uhm... Im actually going on a date.
 Why does he own a guitar if he doesnt know how to play?
 No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
 Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
 Man, Im so sorry. When do you find out?
 Oh, okay.
 Kelly, you know what...
 Sometime today.
 Maybe, but... were gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
 So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&Ms, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he wont get that back.
 Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
  ...What?
 Yeah, you dont?
 ...Okay.
 Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
 Just... quit stalling.
 Such a dork.
 How old are you?
 Well thats an invasion of privacy, so, Im going to tell Michael.
 You... owe me.
 Think you can let go?
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
 Is that Michael?
 ...Its something to think about.
 You look cute today, Dwight.
 So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
  I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
 Whoa. You are a volunteer.
 And thats not the same.
  Volunteer duty.
 Well, your office is behind you.
 Im just saying that you cant be sure that is wasnt you.
 Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just dont remember.
 Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
 Now how do you know how it works?
 No! You said that Id be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
 Oh, um... Why do you keep CCing me on things that have nothing to do with me?
 Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
 Oh...
  Cmon!
||
 Hi.
 How much time do you have left on your break?
 Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just dont get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
 Yeah, I mean its inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but Im fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
 Dwight tried to kiss me.
 And I didnt tell anyone because Im not really sure how I feel about it.
 Well, Im not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
 Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe shes just trying to be friends.
  Well, what does Roy think about everything?
 You mean your thoughts and feelings?
 Yeah...
 Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
 Well, it saves time, you know. Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
 This came out really well.  There you go.
 Oh.
 What did I write?
  Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
 That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took em all out.
 Just a simple macro. You know, these actually dont sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
 Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And thats how I spent my entire day that day.
 Maybe Stanford would be cool.
 Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
 Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
 No, Pam.
 Pam, it wasnt her.
 Im the one who complained about you.
 I... I didnt know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
 You know, it was one day.
 And I took it right back. It was like...
  Hey, Pam... its Jim. Um, I have a doctors appointment in the city. So I probably wont be in till the late afternoon. Just thought Id let you know. Okay, bye.
 Oh, thanks.
 Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
 I can always kind of win at roulette.
 Yeah.
 Mind control.
 Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
 It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
 Okay, Ill try.
 That doesnt exist anymore.
 I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
 Guys, the Afghanistananies.
 What are you doing?
 "Till Death Do Us Rock."
 Oh.
 Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you dont hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, theyre all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
 Lets do it.
 Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
  Wow. I dont know how youre gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
 Yes.
 Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
 Lets take a look. Nice.
 What?
 Oh, my God, thats Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, hes the drummer and the singer.
 Wow. Oh!
 Yeah, you havent seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. Im gonna call the label, were gonna...
 No, Pam, youre gonna lose him to another wedding.
 Kev!
  I will raise.  Thanks.
 Its the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
 Yeah, right.
 What was this?
 Really?
 Wow. I think youre bluffing.
 Oh. Three nines.
 Thank you very much. It was fun.
 So, thats still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
 No, thanks. You having fun?
 Yeah, we all really...
 Well, I think you look great.
 Yeah, why did you?
 Oh, yeah.
 No.
 Okay, will do.
 Hey, hows it going?
 Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
 No, I...
 I was just... Im in love with you.
 Im really sorry if thats weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
 I just needed you to know. Once.
 Yeah.
 Dont do that.
 Come on. I dont wanna do that. I wanna be
