 Hey, Dwight, I dont know if you heard, but were supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
 Wow, thats a lot of keys.
 Thats right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
 I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldnt know for sure cause I dont have a trained ear. Thats why I have to use one of these.
 Yep. Wait, and this.
 Go get em.
 What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
 Oh, no. Dont worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
 Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
 Oh, man, so many points being made.
 But youre comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
 You really think you can make it up to me with food?
 Yep. Thats exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I dont own an Ebay store," so...
 You follow him on Twitter?
 Pam?
 I did not do this.
 This is impressive.
 Do they call you that?
 Come on, give me your hand. Ill help you down.
 Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
 Great.
 Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
  Is there really?
  Aaah!
  Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
  Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
  These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
  Dont beat yourself up.
  Who will be watching the children?
  Prove it.
  Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
  But Ill tell you this, if this works out, I think were looking real good.
  Did something happen Dwight?
  Pam?
  Everything is going to be ok.
  Youre good... youre good at sales.
  Ok, Dwight. We cant do that. So why dont you just tell us what happened?
  Ok.
  Wait, wait, wait. Thats actually a really good idea Kelly.
  Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
  Alright.
  No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
  Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
  No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
  Agreed.
  We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
  Wish us luck!
  Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
  Wait a second. You know you cant buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But Im saying right now, we cant do that.
  Thats it.
  Stop, stop, stop.
  Did you just say you remember him?
  What does that mean?
  Lets just go.
  There it is. Alright.
  Thats pretty good.
 Yes!
 Its my own fault-
 Really?
 For a lot of reasons.
 You should actually thank Erin, shes the one who agreed to babysit.
 Everythings fine.
 We can relax. Lets get our Sweeney on.
 Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
 Oh, my God.
 Okay, this was pretty simple-
  Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
 Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
 No, were good. Thank you, though.
 Alright, well, were never leaving the house again.
  Its like The Hurt Locker!
 No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasnt a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
 We could put that in orange juice.
 Yeah?
 Yeah!
 That was like, ten years ago.
 Nope, its because its genitalia.
 Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
 Good!
 Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
 Just steer more now.
 No! No!
 Amazing. How do I look?
 Well, I do the best with what Ive got. Lets go.
 Hes not the Steve Nash. Hes big though. Hes kind of like...Scrantons Steve Nash.
 Im not doing that. Im just explaining.
 Phoenix Suns point guard?
 No? Nothin?
 Well, Im neither of those things, so...
 Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...
 Well, by worst, you mean the best.
 So, the situation is the worst.
 No, he didnt.
 Tell em.
 What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
 Yeah, I thought you started it.
 Ahhh.
 Okay, great-
 -Im just gonna watch.
  How are ya?
 Dwight!
 Hey, its Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
 Listen, you gotta get over here, cause were pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
 Yes.
 The big gun thing.  Stop!
 No, thats him.
 Nope, not doing that.
 Showtime!
 No, I didnt.
 Is that your office?
 A what?
 I think you mean The Sting.
 Nope. Different movie.
 Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...thats it. Thats really all we were looking for.
 Meredith Van Helsing?
 Okay. But what is he more famous for?
 You know this isnt real TV, right?
 Okay, hes not that good-looking. I dont understand why everybodys obsessed with this-
 We gotta get someone else in there right now.
 Youre an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
 What do you mean?
 Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Heres the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
 So youre taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
 Yes.
 Exactly. You can do this.
 Stop it! Its gonna be great.
 And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
 Who else we got?
 Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
 No, no, no, no...
 No, no, no, no.
 Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
 You hired him?
 Did ya?
 Im just kidding. She told me about it.
 Oh.
 Dwight, please.
 Hey, crazy, um...so...thats it? Youre just-youre fine?
 I dont know.  Oh! Thats... not... yours.
 Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didnt seem to realize that it wasnt his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he wont notice?
 Stop.
 Sounds like someones really trying to convince us that hes not the Scranton Strangler.
  I am Popeye!
 Ive never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number  ...no.
 So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
 Thats right.
 Yikes.
 Oh, no.
 No. No, Im not gonna-no.
 I dont care.
 Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
 That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
 Its not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I dont know about?
 Oooh! You cant handle the truth!
 We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
 Hey.
 When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you dont work hard. Oh, heres something. Uh, why didnt you ever call Pam back?
 Yeah. I mean, Im not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, Im just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
 Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
 Nope.
 Just tell her the real reason.
 Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
 Hey, man.
 To be honest, I still cant believe he didnt call her back. Who doesnt call a dork like that back?
  Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.
 Stop.
 Elaborate.
 So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
  Youre welcome.
 Big day.
 Nope.
 It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
  Ok, your turn.
 Right now?
 Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? Were gonna take a little field trip.
  Okay. Okay. Theres my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. Whats that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
 What?
 Yes.
 This is happening.
 No. Theres no extra outfit in the bag.
 I did... say that.
 Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
 Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The Halberts are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."
 Hey.
 Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
 Yeah.
 Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
 Okay, well, you know what? Everybodys hungry.  Sorry. I think Im just hungry.
 Scones.
 I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
 All right. And cider.
 Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Dont worry. Shes asleep. Im just gonna track down some more chairs.
  Uh, MeeMaw, wheres Cece?
 Okay.
 Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
 I dont know, dad. I dont know.
 I dont know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
 A small blonde woman?
 Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
  Hi.
  Hi.  All right. Travel safe, Angela.
 Whats that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, dont, because Ive got my eye on you.
 Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
 Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jacksons funeral. Things that if you didnt see them live, you wouldnt really care that you didnt see them at all.
  Okay?
 You play?
 You cant even do that.
||
 Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
 Okay...
  Hey.
 I dont know about, love...
 Well I think enemys a strong word. Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
 I dont think thats gonna...
 What kind of pizza would you like?
 Thats not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
 Okay...
 You need to stop talking.
  Okay...
 Im going home, and Im taking my baby with me.
 Im not gonna-
 Uh, its saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? Cause otherwise we cant do any work.
 Nope.
 No.
 Okay, Im not doing every number.
 Why dont we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? Whats the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
 Im trying everything.
 Thats--  the password. Were in.
  All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right.  Whoo!
 I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Lets be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything.
 Mm-Kay, Well, it cant be zero, Kev.
 What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
 A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
 Nope.
 Okay.
 Well, since I have no incentive to sell, Ive cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
 Pam. Okay, now Ive tried everything.
 No.
 Yeah, its not as fun if Im not blowing off work.
||
  Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
 Talk to me.
||
||
  All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again.  Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
 Why?
  Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
 Oh, dont worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
 Well, A for effort right?
 Which is you.
 I disagree with.
 Okay, someone look it up.
 Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
 Oh God, Ive been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
 Oh wow, these are nice.
 Yeah, yeah. Totally.
 Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. Weve got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
 Around here, Oscar is known as actually because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
 Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
 No.
 Hes trying to set you up Michael. Whats going to happen is hes going to try and bring up what ever youre talking about in a very casual way, but secretly hell be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Havent you noticed that I dont bring up the Tour de France around him?
 No politics?
 Two for two, keep it up.
 What do you know about boobs?
 Thank you.
 Show him how to use it.
 Its still on a bike path though right?
 What does that mean?
 What?
 But you didnt fail.
 And you didnt fail those things either.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
 One Charlies Angels. One. Lets go.
 You gotta be kidding me. Who isnt jumping?
 Whys it smell real?  Ah... good one.
 Hey, its snowing.
  Hey, Dwight.
 Well, its not a snowball, cause its only a dusting. Right?
 Youve got something on your nose.
 No.
 You got it.
 Hey.
 We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
 Me neither. Whew.
||
||
 Stop! Stop!
 Oh... oh!
 Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing em until he exhausted himself. And, uh,  then...  "How bout icing it? lol. Dwight."
 Okay... Hollys back.
 Aww...
 Dont. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
 Stop!
 Okay. Okay. Okay.
 Seriously!
 Okay. Okay.
 I just want it to stop.
 Hey, Toby.
 No way.
 Thats increadible.
 You know whats crazy?
 I cant reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.  Excuse me.
 What are you talking about? Youre the one terrorizing me.
 Okay, Im sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
 Yikes.
 No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
  "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese."  Damn it, Dwight!
 Well, uh... I dont think any of us really know. Alright.
 Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
 You like it?
 Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldnt make that.
 Alright, my turn.
 Right. Of course.  "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! Thats my bike. Thats my desk. And that is my daughter.
 I mean...
 I surrender.
 Anything. You got it.
 Youre a psychopath.
 I dont want to go.
 Have you ever seen em do that?
 No, its, its okay. Okay.
 Okay. This is it.
 Go! Go! Go!
 Oh.
 Im actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
 Im just looking for my phone, so... pretend Im not here.
 Sounds good.
 Smart.
 Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
 Was it?
  Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
 Listen, this isnt a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
 Wow.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, Im really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I cant be apart of this seminar.
 I know.
 Im really sorry. I cant do it.
 Will you let me know when this whole seminar things over?
 I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
 Hey.
  I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I dont think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
 Psst. You think this things gonna go much longer?
 Ohh! Good-bye.
 Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
 I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
 Was in the green group.
 And thats what I told him.
 "My mom thinks youre too dumb to hang out with."
 Yeah, woah.  Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
 Hey.
 Pretty good.
 It has been, yeah.
 Sales.
||
 Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
 All right, good catch-up.
 See ya.
 All right. Bye.
 Lets Go!
 Hes going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
 Thats it? Thats all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
 Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
 Whered I put what?
 Oh, sorry gotta go.
 Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, youre really getting warmer.
 Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
 And the final clue...
 You know what, just think about it, youll be fine.
 Cheer up. We made a sale.
 Well, Im going the speed limit. So...
 Someones in a bad mood.
 Alright, let me turn on some music.
 No you dont.
 Alright. Well well be there in ten minutes.
 Alright, Well if I see a gas station, Ill pull over.
 Hello?
 Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
 Ok...
 What?
 Oh my God.
 Just stay there. Ill be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. Hes coming out but I have to go because its an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
 Hey its me. So uh, dont worry. Everythings ok.
 Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Youre not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
 Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
 No no no its ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. Shes laughing and shes happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
 Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So heres the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
 And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
 Nope.
 Ok. Bye.
  There you go. Thanks.
 Big tip.
 What?
 We decided to have a Valentines day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentines day dinner thing. Its a whole thing.
 Shh.
 Um, bottomless champagne.
 No.
  All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.
  Wait.
 Aww, nuts.
 OOH! Boom! Face!
 Did it!
 Love it. Keep it goin.
 Mm-hmm.
  Ew.
 Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so hes not here.
 Definitely not. Thats disgusting.
 Hey, you dont have to...
 That was really rough.
 No, because the office isnt what Id consider a romantic place.
 And a shower.
 What?
 No. We took a walk.
 Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
 Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
 I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
  Sorry.
 Im sorry, Im really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
  Thats fine, its great!
 Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
 Three months.
 Four months.
 Eight months?
  Eleven months.
 Okay now really think hard about this one  One year.
  Four hundred and ninety-four months?
 Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. Thats just...
  Why is Packer back?
 What!?
 You did approve it?
  Can I do something for ya?
 Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
 Do I have any say in this?!
 Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
  Why are you nodding?
 Well, I mean he humped Michael.
 Yeah.
||
 Thats a lot of reasons!
  Can I talk to you a second?
 So, this hot chocolate thing.
 Well, you know you cant actually poison him.
 I really think we should join forces on this one.
 What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
 Here we go.
 Youve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he cant get to them.
 Okay! Well this isnt my best, but call Froggy101, say that were the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and were giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and its his own number.
 He... Its a crime fighting beaver.
 Absolutely, Ill e-mail you a hundred.
 Yeah I couldnt cut it down.
 One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
  Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jos a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what youre gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.
 It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jos kept her eye on you!
  Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
  All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!
 Hes a jerk.
 Wait! Why dont we come up with a plan were all happy about?
 Oh, yikes.
 How did those get out? Im sorry.
 I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and hes selling these. Dwight hes telling me things about myself that theres no way he could have known.
 Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
 Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfields Miracle Legumes.
  Im really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
 Theyre legumes Dwight, and youre just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now.
 Shes amazing. This is very exciting.
 Thats a guarantee.
 Dont think you need the corpse then.
 At a gas station.
 Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
 Totally reasonable.
 Cause its a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
 Yeah... it.s scary.
 Not bad right.
  Nice.
 Oh my God.
 It is right. I mean, its impossible.
 Theyre probably worthless.
 Leave the telescope.
 Holly, will you marry me?
 Congratulations!
 Wait, what?
  We made that.
 Yeah, they dont ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
 Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them da-das.
 And what happens here is-
 We were... I think she was just trying to-
 Wait, so, you dont go into shock or die or anything?
 Listen, youre the one who decided to leave. Come on, hes the new boss, you know we have to do this.
 Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
 Thank you very much.
 Were back in! Right?
 Yep, okay...
 Okay.
 No she doesnt wa- Shes not here.
 Stay in bed!
 Having a great time.
 Thanks, yeah.
 Why dont you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
  I just dont understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
 Whos gonna see us?
 Get in the car?
 I think Im gonna go.
 I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!
 Im sorry, that just wasnt interesting to me.
||
 Nope, go back to the script.
 Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if youre watching this at home its way past your bedtime, by the way howd this get televised?
 I dont know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I dont know, I dont know. Thank you!
 Didnt I?
 I gotta go do this.
 I dont know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
 That did. Pretty huge laugh.
 And impressions!
 You gotta play along man.
 So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
  Hey! Its almost your last day, come sit with us.
 You sure?
 Did you break the shredder Kevin?
  Ahh, what happened to you?
 Uhh, shes still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
 Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
  So Ive been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
 What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
 Youre not leaving tomorrow. Youre leaving today right?
 Wow, so thats it huh? Just, four oclock and you are gone for good.
 Absolutely not. Its just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
 You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
 And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.
 Alright.
 Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
  I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
  You got it.
 Hey!
 No he doesnt.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
 Every time theres a silence, your brains like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" .
 Careful.  There is no inner circle.
 There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
 Thats Toys R Us, I think.
  Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant."
 Seriously?
 What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
 Hes good at his job.  And I like working for him.
 And say what?  "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
 Mmm-hmm.
 Hey, you got a second?
 Umm, really, its nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
 If its alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
 I know.   Just the guys.  Well, maybe thats, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
 Maybe theres a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
 Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
 Oh.  Like nobody.
 It was --
 Thats awesome.
 Hey, whod you end up hiring?
 Oh yeah, did he text us?
 He didnt text me.
  Dont worry, the first days always the hardest.
 Yeah.
 Nope.  Just...  Okay.
 Well, there is no inner...circle.
 So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery .  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
 You know what?  Instead of a game, why dont we do an exhibition?  Id love to see that dunk of yours.
 Today.  Now, maybe.  Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you dont have to mime it.
 Why not?
 Alright, there you go.
 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
 Okay.
 Fantastic.
 Yup.
  Now what?
 Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
 Erin.
 All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?
 Nope. Baskets have it.
 So as it turns out, unless youre a young child or a prison inmate, you dont need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
  Well, I really appreciate the offer, but Im just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I dont want to mess this up, right? Theres a consensus, people are happy.
 Wait...
 Im coming.
 Youd slow me down.
 Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Lets see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mines at 1030, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
 Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
 You define foment.
 Oh, its just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. Its just a club. Guys talking, you know.
 Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.
 And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, its a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.
 Wow, youve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
 And the desk.
 Okay.
 I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
 You cant fire me. Youre acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
 You wouldnt dare.
  If you get promoted, and if you havent fallen in love with me by then.
 If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well thats pretty premature to think," but I always say, its better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
 Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, Im on the spot. I dont know. Um... you know what? I think Im good.
 Nope. When Jos here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
||
 Well, I dont know about that. Just wasnt for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
 Yep.
 Hey, Dwight. Whats up?
 Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? Theres no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.
  He never called a meeting.
   Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
  Really?
   ...What is it?
  You could just be saying it to get the job.
  How about this. Why dont you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
  Okay.
  Did you just trademark that...
  We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branchs new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someones bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, Im not too worried. But Im really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabes last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
  Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
  Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
  Yes.
  Yes.
   He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius.
   Oh.
  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
   So I think all we need is a resume, and well be good right?
  Yeah, its no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool?
  Can I ask why youre leaving your current job?
  Is this a bad time to be doing this?
  Andy? You all set?
  So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
   Is it?
  Your departments just you, right?
  Good!
  Yeah.
  Peepa.
  Great.
  No.
  Youre not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
   Okay. Thats vivid.
  Yikes.
  Well, you know how I like taking bribes.
  Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesnt trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
  Okay.
  Thank you.
  Great.
  Im sure its fine.
  Howard Cline?
   Oh... Deshaun Williams.
  Hes an amazing man. Hes a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
  Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
  Thats very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
  I think thats probably all we need to hear from...
  Thats very...
  You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
  No, not at all. In fact, Im not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, Im just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
  Uh--
  Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
  No, was it good?
   Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here youre French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
  Assistant to the Regional Manager.
  What is it?
  Oh, thats my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldnt hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? Thats a travesty.
   No. No! Wait, but, I mean, youre Dwight, and then... hes the...
   Ohhhh!
  This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."
  Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
  Um... why Kelly?
  Okay.
  Oh, I didnt know you knew her?
  No.
  You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasnt a good fit.
  All right. Name.
  Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know.
  I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
   All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Lets discuss.
  Yes.
  Thank you, Dwight.
  Well, that was quick.
  Hes not a real candidate.
  You took the deal.
  Thats not okay.
  What is happening right now?
  No, why would you think that?
  Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
  No, no, no. Not ever, cause thats not gonna happen.
  Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like Im going a little bit crazy.
  Thank you.
  Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
   I suppose I am.
  Yes.
  Okay.
  Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
  Hey! Hey! Hey!
  What about Darryl? We can all agree that hes a stand-up guy, right?
  What? No, no, its not a vote.
  I dont know. This conversation really got away from me.
  No, they cant. Thats not how this is gonna work.  Were going in this room, were going to have a meeting. Were gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and shes gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there?
