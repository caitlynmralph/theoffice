 The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.Â  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I dont really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.Â Â  And he chose
 Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
 No, I told you I dont like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
 No one should be planking at all.
 You watching that commercial again?  Why do you keep watching it, if you know its just gonna make you cry?
 Hes got a bank vault. Thats a start.
 The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who hes gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope its not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. Its strange.
  Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.  Okay.  What is this?
 Its, its nothing.
Â  Its just a list of our names, split into two columns.
 Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
 No. Okay. Um, Ill take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
 We dont need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
 I promise you, we dont need a warning-
 Left.
 Why are you- How do you know?
 Uh, no, actually. That was in Roberts notebook.
 Okay, its not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
 I dont think its-
 Thats not it.
 Mmum, still wrong.
 Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!
 Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
 Hey. Its nothing. Alright? Ill text you when we get there. Let you know whats going on.
 Nope. No dog video.
 Okay. See you guys.
 Uhhh, the street?
 Oh, I didnt know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
 Right.
 Yeah, she does like Elmo.
 Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
 Shhh.
 Alright, Im gonna go warm up the car.
 Ryan? A little help?
 Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
 Good. What? Nothin
 I dont think we have to do this again cause its gonna take a whole.
 Come on, man.
 Hey, so this isnt matching up with thisand Im not sure which ones right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
 Alright.
 Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
 Yeah, alright Kev why dont you come with us?
 Does it save time though? â€˜Cause weve been here for about an hour.
 K, Kevin, are you saying â€œSee the worldâ€? or â€œSea World?â€
 No, see? Right there, thats the problem with your method. â€˜Cause I still dont know if youre saying â€œSea Worldâ€ or â€œsee the world,â€ and its taking a lot of time to explain it.
 How many L to a K?
 Ill take five.
 Your ex-wife?
 Wow. Alright. Cant wait to meet her.
 She looks at it when shes on the potty, and she makes the faces.
 We know that.
 You have a walking buddy.
 I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much.  Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
 Ok.
 Andrew.
 No, I didnt notice anything.
 I dont know what to tell you, man.
 Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
 Nah, you definitely werent kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.
 Yeah. Big sale. Dont worry about it though, I dont really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donaldcan you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.
 and Im back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
 Gettin psyched up?
 Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this
 I mean, do you like it? You having fun?  Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun.and you did that.
 But I think its big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea.which, by the way, I cant wait for.
 Absolutely not.
 Pull up your pants.
 Id hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70s theme party, or a 70s theme meeting, or a 70s theme convention...
 1870s...
 Nope, he means tuna dog.
 Do Snowboarders hate animals?
 Dwight! At least aim it.
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
 Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
 So...ah, whos gonna take the dog?
 What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
 Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
 Yeah, thats pretty good.
 Nice job.
 Oh man, its gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
 I mean, I dont even know what Id do with all that money.
 No, Id probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. Id either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
 Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
 Which ideally would be me....
 Stop. Im a barista in your fantasy?
 I dont know about Stephen King, I mean...
 Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
 OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. Thats seventy-five boxes per person, so thats not so bad.
 Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
 Theres gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
 Yeah  Not that theyre not smart people.
 Id go with that.
 Not that, dont...
 Its a great idea Kev, I dont think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
 Our fake winnings
 It is, yeah. I mean I just dont know why Im compromising if its my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy its Maine and you love it.
 Nope. Youre, youre doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.
 A...hot chocolate tea
 Kevin Costner.
 Yeah.
 So, its not the dumbest idea.
 But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
 So sadly, its the best idea on the table.
 Is he OK?
 OK, alright, thats...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
 Thats alright.
 Doesnt matter what the name is. SeÃ±or Loadenstein, thats stupid.
 Thats OK, were good.
 Porque es muy rapido.
 Right. Its city and country combined.
 And I can fish right from the window of Pams pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
  Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
 But what are you gonna do about that?
 Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and were basically there.
 Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
 Dammit Dwight!
 Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
 Ok, I just asked that ques-, I dont know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
 So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright!
 Whoa whoa whoa!
 No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! Youre way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
 Good.
  Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
 Youve seen it, right?
 Theres this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If theres an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, itll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
 Okay, dont be gross.
 Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
  So, weve typed in the address, now lets take a look at the street view.
 Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
 Im actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.  Ive only sold one copy.
 Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
 Oh, hey, how are you doing, Im Jim.
 No.
 No, no, no, no, no. No.
 Chapter 4 â€“ One of the hosts most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
 Chapter 9 â€“ The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
 Closing ceremonies.
 I think I left my wallet in your house.
 Right here.
 Keys, keys...
 I didnt forget them, theyre right here.
 Im so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
 Whoo.
 Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
 Chapter seven The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
 I dont know if I can.
 Alright.
 I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
 No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
 Hey.
 Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
 Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
 Mmhmm. No, but what Im saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
 Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
 Hey its Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because Ive read a lot about this really great documentary.
  Its called Ghostbusters.
 It didnt have a buster sign around him?  Why dont you draw him?  Why dont we see this whole thing.
 I aint fraid of no ghost.  Whoa!
 You know thats
 I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
 Party looks fun doesnt it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
  Are you serious?
 Thats funny.  Ok.
  Thank you.
 Careful, whoa. First of all, its not like I think thats going to help the Eagles win.
 No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. Its not...
 Thank you.
 Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, theres a ghost in my closet." Now, you say one of two things - one, "Youre just having a bad dream," or two, "Lets go see what it was."
 Ok.
 Oh, come on!
 Pink is the red-
 I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
 Oscar, how are you on that side?
 But that would make more sense.
  ...W R K.
 Uh no its W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe thats what you are hearing.
 Im just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derbys in a really good place now. Somy pitch isme, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
 Is that off again?
 Ok.
 Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
 Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
 Dwight, question.
 If this doomsday device goes off...
 If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
 Ok.
 Nope.
 HmmHeda.  No.
 Ok, where is he?
 Ill try both.
 Robert.
 Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
 You up for a game?
 Exactly. Here we go. Lets do it.
 Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
 In the box.
  Is that my phone?
 Nah, I think its mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
 Oh, oh yeah.
 Yes. Right now? Yes.
 Here you go.
 Awww, sorry. Did it break?
 You sure?
 What kinda iPhone is that?
 Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
 Ha ha. No, I dont. No, I dont. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-
  Ah! Classic, right?
 Im alright.
 Yep.
 Yep. Ah. Oh.
 Yeah. That does not feel good.
 Ok, he didnt fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
 I wasnt here that day.
 No- Ok. Well, well talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
 Ok, this is crazy.
 I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I dont do that, I think Ill be alright.
  Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
 No? Come on.
 Well, that is... because you didnt realize that... I was left-handed.
 Hmm. Doubt it.
 Whats that?
 Honestly I have no idea. I just figured wed save her from Ryan right?
 Hey.
 Yeah. Super pretty.
 The temp?
 Nope.
 And Im telling you, I dont.
 No, I dont.
 No, Im not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like Im not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. Its true, but it doesnt help anybody.
 Okay. Uh, I dont. So are we good?
 Oh, I stand corrected.
 Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
 Mm-hmm.
 Not his moms car.
 Touche?
 Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think Im in the clear. If that wasnt for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, hes a really nice guy.
 Dwight!
 Dwight! Dwight!
  Sorry about that.
 Dwight!  Why?
 Leave.
 Mm-hmm?
  Told you.
 You okay?
 Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
 Stop shoving me.
  Really?
 Si.
 Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first.
 Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
 No, Im not worried. Because this lie isnt for me, its for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I havent had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
 No.
 I am not lying.
 Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
 Yeah, but I dont smoke.
 I dont know.
 Okay, easy. Trust me, Im around for the long-haul.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Oh okay, shes going into labor. Make way, everybody!
 Okay.
 Oh my God!
 Okay guys, here we go! Well see you!
 How do you feel?
 Cool. Thanks.
 Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
 No, of course were not tourists. Were just people that arent from here who are taking a tour.
 By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
 Yeah, thats what I had for breakfast and I think thats probably why Im still hungry.
 Only two hundred dollars?
 Oh wow.  So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
 Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come.  I think theyre just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
 What are you talking about?
 Andy â€“ this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  Its just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And youre our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You dont have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head.  Im wearing a very pink hat.  Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure â€œDM does GBâ€ means something kinda sexual.  But guess whos wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  Thats huge.
 Theyre terrible.
 Tuna?
 And to drink?
 Oh-ho, I am in.
 Im excited, Ive actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But Im older now, I can outrun a zombie.
 Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
 Its locked.
 Thats weird, if its not locked, why isnt it opening?
 Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. Im gonna find him.
 We didnt have one scheduled.
 Hey guys lets just all admit it. Ok? Dwights better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And hes never, ever going to go back on it right?
  What are you up to? Oops look out!
 Prank!
 You know what its not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
 Because youre sitting?
 Ok.
 Because youre sitting?
 You know I have to do this.
 I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
 I dont know. He wasnt talking to me. But if I were you I wouldnt hire his wife.
 Well its sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
 Well its not that easy. Its kind of sometimes difficult.
 No, I dont think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what its doing.
 Oh, wow. So cute.
 Very cute.
  Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay.
  Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Creed. I was never here, all right?
 Oh boy.
 Do I?
  I know, I do.
 I really wish I could help. Im not really sure how I can...
 Thats the thing. See, I didnt want to get in the middle of this. Still dont. But heres something I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
 Perfect!
 Yes?
  I dont know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why Im here. And between us, shes on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I dont know how this helps, but its just what Im thinking.
 Yes. All right. Great.
 This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. Im not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanleys tie is really the story of the day...
 Ok, so thats a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. Its pretty smart, right?  Hi, how you doing? Im Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
 You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, Ill just be in, you know.
 I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
 Shes not your grandmother, is she?
 Yeah.
 It wasnt me.
 Kathy wants to leave our clump?
 Ow, What are you doing?
 Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
 What was that?
 Cant do that.
 Ah... Im gonna s-
 Dwight really wants my bonus. Hes trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I cant drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
  Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh its uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
 So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
 I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
 Hmm...
 Nice try, this is ridiculous.
 Three times.
 Andy, youve gotta be kidding me.
 OK, you know what? Why dont we just call animal control...
  Yes, Im calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
 Uh, I dont know, let me ask.  Uh, were you quilled?
 And whats its name?
 Oops.
 Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
 Yes. It is.
 I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
 I dont-
 Yeah.
 O...K.
 Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldnt have got you involved because the truth is, I dont even really care about this picture, its a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
 Right. Youre right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
 Ill figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
 You alright, Santa?
 Yes.
 Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
 OK.
 Alright. I will definitely do that.
 You know what? Youre sitting, and thinking, and its probably better if it comes from me anyway.
 Yes. They totally do.
 Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......Cmon, Jim.  I got nothin.
 Cathy wants to leave our clump?
 Sorry it didnt work out. Hope you find what youre looking for.
 Thats ok.
 Thatd be great, thank you.
 You can write a book about chairs.
 Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that dont know what paper is.
 Stop right there. I love it.
 In Philadelphia.
 Thats a great idea.
 Yeah.
 All right, good stuff.
 I thought it was a fun idea.
 Okay.
 Theres a table over here.
 Shawn Marion.
 Wrong, for so many reasons.
 Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
  All right.
 Andy, its the last day of the quarter. Weve already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
 Andy, were gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
 Its always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that shes out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, Ive found out what he likes. And its really weird.
 I know.
  Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
 You know, theres a glare from over here... oh wow, thats magnificent.
 Im sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
 I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
 Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
 DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
 Youre looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I dont mean to brag, but New Years Eve, I was home by nine.
 Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
 I bet I should.  Thats beautiful, Im going to email that to you.
 All right-
 I must...
 Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This nights been magical.
 Really? Why?
 Good night.
 To both these bears.
 To madness.
 Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
 Are you serious?
 And theres my talking point.
 To the shame room!
 Hey.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 It was pretty uneventful, actually.
 Uh, hit and run.
 Nope. Not guilty.
 Were best friends, actually. Were going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
 Okay.
 I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didnt think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
 Aw man, I would but I cant miss any more work.
 Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
 Wow, Im really sorry.
 I never considered that my week off would make everyone elses job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
  So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
 Oh man, Ernestos. That was our favorite restaurant too.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay, wait, wait.
 No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasnt listening to you.
 ...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesnt matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
 Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
 No.
 No.
 Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
 Uh-
 The empanada guy!
 Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
 Because my car broke down.
 Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
 Okay, listen, all right? Dwights on to us, hes going to figure it out really soon, so lets just get ahead of it, lets tell the truth.
 Uh, excuse me, can I have everyones attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that Im really sorry, I didnt know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think youre going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
 Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
 Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
  You want a giraffe?
 Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
 Whoa, no, no. Thats overdoing it, I think.
 Split the difference?
 Okay, lets go.
 What?
 Wow, what a surprise. Thats crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
 Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
 That was a great idea.
 Oh my goodness, lets take a look at these. Theyre usually amazing, so lets see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
 Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
 You know what? I dont think you need to do things on command. Thats very weird. Ill just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
 I dont know what else we can do here.
 Its okay.
 All right, all right. Okay.
 All right, I know, I know. Lets just get this.
  I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
 Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
 Cece!
 Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, were going home, were going home. Were going home, were going home. I know, I know, bud.
 I know, I know.
 Im gonna grab her, okay.
 Hi, all right. Im just going to go down to the car and Im going to put her in her seat and Ill be right back up.
 No, no, its okay, Ill be right back.
 Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Lets go.
 I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if thats not happening, Im not averse to just buying them all off.
 Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but its always buried behind like a ton of black licorice?  Bought it all. Now its like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
 Uh, I cant get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I cant...
  Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right?
 Its not really food, right?
 Ok, ok, ok.
 â€œAnd shove it up my butt.â€
 Im not gonna eat it.
 Im not-
  They hate me, Pam.
 No, its bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
 Its a lunch thing.
 I feel like a stranger in my own country.
 Ok. Well, hey, youre not here. You dont know, Ok? Its intense. They made me eat black licorice.
 Oh ho! Look whos back reporting for duty.
 Nope. Its over.
 Nope. OK.
 Ooh, me three.
 I just got a text from Robert California that says â€œbring your clubs to Floridaâ€.
 I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks?
 â€œRobert, Hey!â€ Exclamation point.
 â€œGot your text, awesome idea. Lets hit the links next time youre in PAâ€ Dash JH.
 Yeah, its a golf text.
 Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
  Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
 Ok, sending.
 Really did  He responded L-O-L.
 Now, is it too dark to say that Cicis having an operation?
 I think youre right.
 Total nightmare.
 Yeah, thats what Im saying. Theyre incredibly helpful, youre lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably wont even know Im gone.
 You know Dwight, if you didnt want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldnt go.
 Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.
 Essential.
 Alright, Im gonna pack my trunks.
 Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think thats gonna make us roomates.
 Hey, quick question Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when youre showering. Save some water.
 Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
 Mosquito.
 So, what is this special project?
 That sounds awesome.
 Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
 Bye.
 I will.
 I am on the two kid sleep schedule so Im up and at em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didnt know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-
 Puppet.
  Yeah. Its weird being away from them. Never done this before.
 Are you sure its stress? Because I did poison you.
 Oh no, Im serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. Ill poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
 Thats a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
 Yes.
 Loggins and Messina.
 Man.
 Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
 I would love to hear the other mottos.
 No way.
 It was-
 You got to stop with the antacids. Its not the antidote.
 Okay.
 True loves kiss.
 Dwight, I didnt poison you. I was kidding.
 Wow. Are you that bored?
 Is that another motto?
 Mmm.
 Ah, lets do it.  Oh, thats healthy.
 Ive spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, dont end up like Stanley," and now Im wondering if I even have what it takes.
 Oh, I dont know.
 All right, what the heck? Lets do it.
 Dwight, why dont we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
 No ones moving!
 Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
 The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Floridas pretty loose with the death penalty.
 Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
 You havent done any of the research.
 Stanley, are you listening to music?
 You are bleeding through your shirt.
 Catching butterflies.
 Theater.
 Dragging.
 Dragging sticks.
 Talla-nasty, very clever.
 Cathy? Its been great. Fun, normal.  I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but hes turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
 How many buttons do you have?
 College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
  Im sorry, I thought youd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
 In the bed.
 Brown, shiny, painful bite.
 Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
 So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 Ow.
 Just check it.
 Alright.
 He knows what hes doing.
 Alright, then I will catch you later What do we do now?
 Oh.
 Hmm? No.
 Okay alright.  Im really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. Im-Im married. Im very happily married.
 um I mean-
 Im sorry, I feel like maybe Im-Im I misread things. Okay, lets just go back to watching.
 Yes, I can.  uh, all right. Im really sorry. I think well just well just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I dont care.
||
 All right. Now I think its time for you to go.
 Cathy, go.
 Oh yeah? Whats the first best?
  Is that Nellie?
 Which Spice Girl?
 Okay.
 Come on, man.
  Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
 Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
 Im very sorry.
 Im really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
 Dwight.
  You can...  You can do it Ryan.
 Youre the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
 I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
 About ten minutes.
 Oops, thats my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
 Its Ryan. â€œIm sorry. I lied. Im not in the bathroom. I cant do it. I need to see my mom. Im going home.â€
 Uh...
 okay.
 Im not doing the Presentation.
 Okay, Ill do it.
 A costume?
 Ive been in here for 20 seconds.
 Im not wearing eyeliner.
 Oh, that reminds me.  Little something from all of us.
 This is the last time Ill ever see Dwight. Its a weird feeling, its, um, whats the word? Its not, its not bittersweet. Its uh... sweet. Yeah.
  All right. So... I guess this is it.
  Goodbye, Dwight.
 Well, hes Floridas problem now.
 Whats that?
 I thought you liked the store?
 Thank you.
 Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
  All right. There he is.
 Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
 Um, actually its, its for your own good. I think maybe we should-
 You know, I just think you should know that-
 Well, I tried.  You saw it, so, its on the record. I have a plane to catch.
 No, no, I think it was more like, you know, I liked him, but I dont anymore because he did a bad job, so Im definitely gonna yell at him.
 I tried. He will not listen.
 Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you havent dealt with him in awhile, all right. Hes like super Dwight. Its like hes been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
 Stanleys very upset that were leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
 OK. All right.
  Dwight.
 OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me.  No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
 Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
 Dwight, hes gonna kill the store.
 And then, Im pretty sure hes gonna fire you for it.
 Yes.
 Dwight, please.
 OK, first of all, theyve mostly worked, so-
 Dwight, come o-
 Gross! Dont lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
 Gross!
 What? What, what, what, what, what?
 Im sorry.
 Im so sorry, I forgot.
 You all right? You ok?
 What are you doing?
 Get up.
 Get up. All right? Im not gonna let you by.
 OK.  What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesnt work.
  What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
 This is dangerous.
 Why?
 Nope. I think that was it.
 Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
 Hey.
 I missed you.
 Wow. Its the end of an era.
 And I was still just a paper salesman.
 Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
 Nellie
 What brings you to town?
 No, thats Andys office.
 Cant you do something about this?
 -Right.
 What is going on? And wheres Andy? And what is going on?
 I think its a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. Its not a name.
 Any luck?
  Andy?
 Andy, where are you?
 What? Youre in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertrams trying to take your job.
 Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
 Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, youre basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
 Dwight, should she be our manager?
 And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
 The raise isnt real.
 Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
 Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
 Land. World. Uh, its not that I dont want a-- well, yes, I guess Id take a raise. Thats not what Im saying. Thats not-- sorry.
 Yes.
 Oh, god, nature, please.
||
 Was that not the--
 Mm-hm.
 Was that it? No, that wasnt bad.
 No. I wouldve said no.
 I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That its okay for someone to just take someone elses job? Shouldnt work like that.
 No, its not, because you dont really work here.
 Yeah, thats the thing. I dont know if you can even give raises.
 Yes.
 No.
 She dies.
 Lets see it. Show of hands.
 All right, guys, stop.
 How?
 Oh, great.  "Glad they didnt mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh thats not good.
 Stanley doesnt have a moustache.
 Okay, the mans worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
 Okay, quick. Who says moustache?
 Who says no moustache?
 Im sorry, were taking work time to move someones personal belongings into their new apartment.
 Why is she here?
 Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? Cause to be honest, I dont think its gonna fit through the door.
 That was one time-
  Excuse me, one second. Hi.
 Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
 Thats moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
 Sounds like every other party.
 Oh! Hire a magician.
 Trust me.
 Yes, you should.
  "Nellie, dont open, stupid. Love, Nellie."
 I doubt that theyre sh-
 Whoa. Who is this guy?
 Boyfriend.
 Like a boyfriend?
 Yeah. Whoa. Heres one with his face whited out.
 Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
 Oh, Nellie. Im so sorry. We were just...
 Shh!
 Dwight!
 Im so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
 No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
  You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Lets give up on all this mean stuff.
 No, thats not what I-
 Absolutely. Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? Its way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
 Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe theres some stuff in her past that you guys dont know about thats a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
 No. No.
 Oh, Ill do it. I will volunteer.
 Ill do it.
  Its the four of hearts.
 Not true. Cause thats not a real place.
 Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
 Night-night.
 Phyllis says the same twelve clichÃ©s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
  Hey, come on.
 And thats noon. Exactly.
 Thats it.
 Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, thats it.
 Sorry, just to be clear, youre saying do NOT shake the baby.
 Thats about it, yeah.
 Um...
 What happened?
 Couple of times.
 Um... I dont... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, wed had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
 I was very drunk.
 Wow, what are we talking about?
 Hey, hey. Okay.
 Well, its good to see Kellys maturing.
 Not at all, can we go?
 Second line.
 "And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green."
 Uh, Ryan can never know.
 Wow Thats terrible, I really liked him.
 Well, I second that emotion.
 Wow! Look at that! It says hes actually playing State College. Thats only three hours away!
 Tickets are 250 bucks.
 Paul Anka.
 Okay, you could just show up late though.
 Well, as long as you dont want to alarm people...
 Wow, thats exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
 Wait, what? Come on!
 Okay, Oscar, Im not saying youre not dreamy, because you are, but isnt it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
 Okay, what was this look?
 What happened, did he do it?
 Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isnt Downton Abbey.
 Heres what Im going to do. Im going to go over there and Im going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
 Boom!
 what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
 Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
 Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
 Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
 Look at that one though, hes smiling!
 Yes--
 Okay well, Andy, listen. Its okay if you dont feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
 Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
 Yeah
 Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Whos the strongest? Well, theres only one way to solve that â€“ flat curl contest.
 All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
 Come on, Gabe, you cant handle his hamstrings. Youre getting hypno-thigh-zed.
 Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
 Youre welcome.
 Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
 All right, easy there, grandpa.
 Okay. You dont need my help?
 All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
 Thanks Janet.
 Wow, simultaneous sale.
 Screw â€˜em.
 Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
 Hey, hey, come on, language.
 In the fridge.
 Sorry, man, I cant focus on zingers. Theres too many potential clients.
 Robert?
 The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
 Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
 Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
 Theres actually not a rule that says that.
 How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
  Hes running!
 Damn it.
 Its a monkey.
 Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
 Is that him?
 What? What am I gonna do? I dont â€“
 Dwight!
 Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
 Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
 Are you sure?
 Brace yourself. 3 2
 1. Here we go!
 You all right?
 Ah!
  Dwight, what are you doing?
 What are you talking about?
 I dont even know where the stairs are!
 God!
 What?
 Big Red Paper Company?
 All right, guys. It didnt work out for any of us, so were still on the same team. Let me get these.
 But youre saying theres a chance.
 Oh, man, Id have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
 Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
 I dont know. Ive always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
 That sounds lovely.
 I know why youre doing this, Dwight.
 Last week, I may have gone too far. Ill explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
 Now hes trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think its fair to be cautious.
 Hows it going, man?
 Great, yeah, good.
 Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
 Pam? No!
 No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwights photo studio slash trap.
 No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
 Nope.
 But are you a hundred percent sure? I dont think any of us are.
 Nope.
 Thats-
 Thats-
 Okay.
 Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
 Alright. Why dont you just-
 -give him to me and... perfect.
 This is great.
 Excuse me.
 Just do it.
 Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
 Lets do it, shoot it.
 Great.
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, so thats it?
 No, no, see? This is what were talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now youre not drunk...
 Oh boy.
 Andy, come on.
 Hey.
 Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
