 Really, what kind of celebrity?
 How much did you pay for it?
 You paid for it?
 I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didnt mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... Im single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
 Oh that sounds fun. Im mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
 Yeah.
 What?
 Who was driving?
 One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
 Oh good, so we dont have to work.
 I can also take 3 people.
 I think shes awake.
 I wouldnt... I wouldnt worry about it. Dont touch it.
 I will do some research.
 Six of one, really.
 So whats your strategy for this race?
 Mm-hmm.
 What?
 Why wont more people do that?
  What?
  Oh, ah... No thats not... I mean that wasnt, ah...
 I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
 Right!
 Wow! There it is.
 It is going really great.
 Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
 Yeah.
 Bat birth control
 Which we are.
 You know what though, Ive actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
 Great, its gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
 Baquette.
 Eww.
 I can imagine.
 You couldnt have taken off all your clothes in the mens room?
  Gross.
 Alright.
  Oh, Im sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
 Oh, would you look at that.
 Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
 OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease thats already been cured.
 Thats what I thought.
 Right. Lets do some good.
 Oh, and I get to carry it.
 ...talk about it.
 What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
 Well, youre probably dehydrated.
 Glass of water would be a start.
 Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
 You are?
 Hey.
 Oh wow, thank you.
 Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
 I guess.  How dare you.
 Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
 Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
 Ohh..
 Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
 Oh.
 Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
 What?
 Oh, OK.
 Great.
 Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, Im not really sure whats wrong with it.
 Swore I wouldnt tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
 Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
 Wait. What?  You knew? And you didnt say anything?
 Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
 Oh no, were just sitting here.
 OK.
 And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
 Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
 Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
  Nice to meet you.
 Hey.
 Alright I just have to ask now that were public, um, is the magic gone?
 I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
 Be honest.
 Thats honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?
 For me, it was.
 Alright.
 Why dont we just go by ourselves?
 What about a gift basket full of cash?
 Yeah, hes definitely something.
 That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
 I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
 Into a lake.
 Hey.
 Oh wow, thank you.
 Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
 I guess.  How dare you.
 Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
 Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
 Ohh..
 Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
 Oh.
 Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
 What?
 Oh, OK.
 Great.

 Into a lake.
 I know.  I love it there.
 Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
 Sounds great.
 Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
 Theres this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
   Wait for it.
 Hey Meredith, how you feelin?
 Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
 Haha...
 Uh-huh.
  MmmHmm...
  Oh yeah.
  Alright...
  Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
  Actually it sounds like you are.
 Or zipadeedoodaah.
  I was... mocking.
  Or a gong.
  Really?  Power gel?
 What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
  What?
  Yeah, Im aware of that.  But hes also being super annoying.  And Im not a perfect person.
  Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
  Sure well go.
  Oh Im sorry.  What?
  Nope.
  Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
   Hows it going?
  Yeah?
  You look a little worried.
  Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
  Hey man.
  Whats going on?
  Oh yeah?
  Im driving?
  Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
  Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
  Yeah.
  Its not.  Its different.  But its a good book.
  What was that?
  Oh.  Two kisses.
  Gotcha.
  That would be fun.
  Uhhh.  Cant.
  Oh, no cause... youre gonna let me know when were close, right?
  Mmmkay...
 Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
  Yep.
  Are there, uh, three ws at the beginning of the address?
  Yep.
 Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
 You need to let him go.
 Yes.
 Yes, but not by kidnapping.
 As a hostage.
 I think youre under-thinking it.
 Ransom.
 What did he say?
 So, we should let him go.
 Okay.
 Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
 Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
 Okay.
 What have we got here?
 Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
 Which ones this? Perfect.
 Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
 And thats when I knew. You?
 That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
 Wow, can we make it a different moment?
 A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
  Sure, I can hold.
 Hey Dwight.
 Do you run the bed and breakfest?
 Does the Department of Health know about this?
 Uh, Michael.
 That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
 Darn it!
 No, cant.
 Where are you going out tonight?
 I wouldnt understand or a secret?
 I cant believe this place is real. I mean, Ive heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
 The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
 How are you doing this?
 Nice.
 Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
 Not even Harry Potter?
 Hmmm, Id say 1 in 6.
 Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
 You know, Ive just realized, this is Pams and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasnt made out of beets. Didnt think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
  Wait, youre going up there?
 Hey Dwight.
 Does Mose have nightmares?
 Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
 Good night, Dwight.
 You okay?
 Are you a cocktail waitress?
 No, sometimes its right.
 Dwight, hows the hotel business?
 Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
 Maybe you should.
 The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
 You will never want to leave your room.
 Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
 Yeah, I didnt think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
 Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldnt take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldnt sleep, I couldnt concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
 Ah, dinner.  Lets see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Yep, Im very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, Im in love with Italian food.
 Nobody tell him!
 You got it, youre so close!
 Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I dont think...
 Nope.
 I think its great that the companys making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
 You playing that game again?
 Oh it has losers.
 Who are you talking to, specifically?
 Hey.
 Why dont we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you whats going on here.  Okay, this is Dwights Second Life. Hes on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. Its called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
 Yeah.
||
 Oh, its just my avatar guy. Whatever.
 Not much, its just for tracking Dwight so---
 Yep.
 I... why dont we go back to this animation.
 Ah, show me how this works.
 I hope youre not killing yourself on this, because Im sure its good enough for Michaels ad that will probably be seen by no one.
 Okay. Do you want me to stay?
 Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So Im pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
 I, ah...
 Good morning.  Yeah Im sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
 Youre welcome.
 Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
 Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott directors cut. Hope you like it.
 Animation? All her by the way.
 I just thought you should---
 Ahh.
 Oh, I dont think that is whats happening.
 So tell me again why I cant be part of your club?
 Oscar?
 So what are you going to do?
 Did they?
 We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
 What are we doing?
 Were going to Utica?
 Im not going to Utica right now.
 No.
 I cant believe you guys.  Im not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
 No, Im not calling Karen.
 What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
 Are you kidding me?
 Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brothers new baby on it, so...
 Okay.
 You know what?  Im just going to call a cab from here.
 Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
 Oh, God.
 No.
 No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
 Are you kidding me?  Weve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
 So the deal was, Dwight doesnt blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
 What?
 Okay, you know what?
  Why dont we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
 It doesnt matter.
 Doesnt matter.
 That doesnt make sense, couldnt be.
 Oh my God!
 Michael, watch the road!
 Michael! Michael, pull over!
 Pull over, pull over!
 I cant believe were here, I cant believe this is happening.
 No, Michael.  Im not leaving the car.
 Guys going by. Shh.
 No, no, you wont do that. Nope.
 Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
 Oh my God, thats her! Thats her, go, go, go.
 Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing weve ever done.
 Okay, you know what?  You dont need to be updating me as much as youre updating me.
 No, no, dont do anything to them.
 Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
 Isnt that thing huge?
 No, that is a terrible idea, dont do this.
 Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
 Damn it guys!
 Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
 No, Im not doing that.
 No, Im not doing that!
 Hey Karen.
 First of all, hi.
 You good?  Im just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
 Copy that.
 Yes?
 Yeah, trying to quit though.
 Oh no, I didnt want to see you.  Not that Im not happy seeing you, right now, Im just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, Id say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
 I mean, its just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didnt want to see... you...
  Alright, you are welcome.  Im going to go because of, um, traffic.
 I... will...
 Hey.
 Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
  Angelas Ashes, top o the morning to us.  Frankies prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
 Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 No, that wasnt fun.
 Of course I read it.
 Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
 Got it.
 Absolutely, yes.
 When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
 Yeah?
 And I am always busy.
 Oh, cant go today, cause Im donating blood.
 Is there a limit?
 Well, is that it? Or?
 How so?
 Whats that?
 Right.
 Not gonna change.
 I thought we had that looked at.
 Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
 OK, great.
 Yup.
 Thatd be great.
 Oh, wasnt it just someones birthday?
 I do remember, yeah.
 You know what, I have an idea. Why dont we just do one big shared party?
 There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
 And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And hes a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
 So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
 We can just have one big fun party. Everybodys happy, nobody wastes their time.
 Its a pretty good idea, dont you think?
 No... I think its a great idea.
 You know, try sending them another invoice.
 Alright.  Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
 Right? I was just thinking...
 Right! Exactly.  Knew I could count on you.
 Whats that?
 Oh, sure.
 OK.
 Yeah, people like me I guess.
 Well I think Meredith was just --
 Everybodys birthday.
 What do you want?
 You want a birthday pie?
 Well, Im gonna to talk to Angela and were gonna see what we can do about a pie.
 It will be Angela.
 Andy.
 Not your birthday.
 Alright, Ill look into it, but the answers no.
 Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
 Alright.
 OK, Im gonna go into this office here  to do some work. So I will be in here.
 Hey guys, whatre we talking about?
 Toby.
 Oh, thanks man.
 Is there anything --
 Oh, OK.
 What?
 I remember that.
 Seriously?
 Tobys great. Hes great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much.  I dont see the harm in that. Well, its a cake Toby, so, cmon.
 OK. Yeah, you know what, were just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
 Thats a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
 Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. Were gonna solve it right here. Were actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldnt do it.
 Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
 Hey.
 Sure glad youre back.
 You have no idea.
 Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
 So, terrible idea.
 You did do it?
 Well, I dont think Ill be here in ten years.
 Thats what who said?
 Thats what she said.
 All right, lets run it back.
 Sure.
 Wow.
 Oh, I cant beat Darryl.
 What, seriously? What is she saying?
 So youre asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
 Bring me players.
 Good game Meredith.
 Dwight! Thank God youre here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
  What the hell?
 Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
 I think Im ready.
 ...Right. Spin-serve!
 Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
 Nope I dont, remember when you told us not to make plans cause were working.
 I think you did.
 Oh, I-
 Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time weve been able to get out of it. But Ive got to give him credit, he got me. Because Im starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
 Hi.
 Lets see, since I saw you an hour ago?
 I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
 Really?
 Tour, lets do the tour first.
 Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
 Its fire.
 Just like that.
 Really? cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
 Wow.
 What is that chestnut?
 Michael, Im just terrible at all this stuff, so thats really cool.
 Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. Im surprised theyre not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
 What was that?
 Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and its called Lets see how uncomfortable we can make our guests and theyre both winning. So Im going to make a run for it.
 Youll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
 Thats true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam Ill see you at home, thank you so much.
 I dont know because I everything I own is there.
 Katie Holmes.
 Oh, Dawsons Creek.
 Not really a rhyme.
 Tom Cruise!
 Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
 Im sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jans company?
  So... how do you guys know each other?
 Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
 Nevermind.
 Thats nice.
 Its getting late.
  Of course
 Oh... my apartments on fire
 Flooded.
 You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
  I stole this.  For you babe.
 So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
 Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
 Oh, you dont know her.
 Your mom.
 Michael, you didnt even know her.
  Margaret?
 You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.
 Oh really? Whos gonna take you in? Youre messy. Youre a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
 OK, sure. Lets do it.
 Have I not proposed to you, yet?
 Oh, well, thats coming.
 No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
 Pam, Im not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but thats not how that works.
 Wait, Im serious. Its happening.
 And when it happens, its going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
 I am not kidding.  Got it a week after we started dating.
 Nice.
 Where do you want to go for dinner?
 Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
 What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem?  Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
 No, no, no.
 Howd you get gum in your hair?
 But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
 Nope. Not for you its for your hair, and it is 9 am.
 Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
 Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I dont know that a websites going to be able to replace that.
 Thanks.
 Did I? I dont...
 Hmm.
  Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
 And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
 What?
 Im gonna go to my desk.
 I know.
 I cant.
 Im not single.
 Pam.
 You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldnt have to come in at all tomorrow.
 So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
 Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
 Nice job everybody. Great work.
 Nope. I didnt, but lets go inside and I can call him right now.
 You really dont have his phone number?
 Great, Its under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
 Its ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
 Its not, its not Eddie, its ah, Evan or...
 No guys his names not Hank, its ah, is it Edgar?
 Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. Youre the guy who sits behind the desk... youre, youre the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean youre. Ah... Who, Whove I got here?
  Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it.  Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and hes gonna let us all out.  He said it should just be under an hour, so...  we did it.
 Yup...
  Please dont pick up, please dont pick up, please dont pick up.
 Haaank. Is that you?
 Still havent left the house yet, huh?
 Good. Please hurry.
 Will do.  Ill stop calling.
  Cleaning people. Oscar.  OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, cause I think they can help us.
 I... just... if they speak Spanish.
 Lucky us.
 Yeah thats true.
 If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
 We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
 Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
 Well thats not true. Other people believe its deeper inside...
 And in this case...
 Thats also not true.
 You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
 Would...
 Well, its too late, because Im proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
 What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
 An urban thing...
 Oh boy...
 On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
 A formal warning...
  Im sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didnt mean to go over your head.
 Im sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause Im not sure whats really...
 Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
 Yeah...
 Thats not a good idea.
 Who?
 Lets go.
 Okay, you know what? Why dont you take my hand, and leave them, and lets get out of here.
 Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that Id like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that Ive never done before. Try.
 Mr. Maguire, its been a couple of years.
 Great!
 Hey, so hows the direct mail business going?
 Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
 Absolutely, will do.
 So I guess Ill just... work on my short game.
 You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
 Yep.
 Hey, cant really talk now, whats up?
 Uh, you know, well see, well see.
 Oh, I like you.
 Yeah. All right. Bye.  All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
 Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
 Absolutely.
 You know its a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I dont quit either, and Id call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so Im feeling pretty good.
 I closed it!
 Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
 Thank you. You know what, screw this!
  Hello, this is Dwight.
 Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
 And how many would you like?
 Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
 Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
  Hello, this is Dwight.
 Yes it is.
 Oh, thank you. Ive been working out.
 Cant do that. Unsanitary.
  This is Dwight.
 Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
 Oh, hello Mater. Good news Ive married. Tell Fater.  Such a nice woman.
 Hey... What?
 No way! What did I say? I said that theyd love those sketches. Congratulations!
 Yes! So when do you start?
 Wow. Busy morning.
 Its not a big deal. Ill come visit you. And youll visit me. Its only two hours away. Itll be fine. That parts gonna suck, but itll be great.
 See how easy that is?
  So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, its big. It is really big.
 Thanks.
 I just-
 No, I didnt. I just logged it in right here, so...
 All right, well it already went through, so...
 Hello?
 Thats not it.
 Yeah.
 Close.
 Mmhmm.
 What are the two levels?
 Mmhmm.
 Okay. Lets start with the "I love you" level.
 Yes. You dont love Holly.
 But you just met her.
 Oh, okay, it doesnt work like that.
 Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
 Yeah.
 Weve been through this.
 Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
 Well, were really happy.
 And thats really sweet. And you can think that. But you dont say that out loud, and you definitely dont say it to her.
 I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all Im saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
 I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
 Because Im gonna miss Toby. Yep, hes a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesnt matter. Here ya go.
  Well we all want a good party, right?
 Im going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
  Hey, Ryan, its Jim. Look man, I dont know whats gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really dont care, because youre trying to get rid of me. And I bet you dont think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but youre wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? Im not going anywhere.
 Whatd you do?
 Wow. Okay, so howd that feel?
 Oh, Im so glad you didnt.
 There you go. Theres plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
 Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
  Right to voicemail.  Hey, Ryan, its Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!
 Yeah, whod have thought?
 Classic.
 Not my favorite, but...
 Its not my favorite...
  Hey...
 I know. Thats awesome, man. Thats great.
