 You are really good at modesty. Shes a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids room. Theres a hippo leading a parade of 500 childrenâ€”
 Oh, yeah
 Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
 In Philly, so, that doesnt really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
 An Altima or better.
 we good?
 No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Merediths face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
 Done. Explain.
 Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
 The new guys called one.
 Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
 You should ask him. Its a color you would never expect.  Too easy.
 You a sports fan?
 Oh. Any team sports?
 Phillies fan, though, right?
 No, like baseball. A baseball team.
 Ok. Good talk.
 I have nothing in common with Plop.
 Oh, come on, Pete! God, thats just sad. If he doesnt watch himself, hes gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
 Yeah. You know what? Ill meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Hey, man. Its halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, dont. Im in. Yeah, yep, Im all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah!
  Spinning would be more fun.
  Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandmas got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roys wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wifes ex-fiancÃ©s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that its your wifes ex-fiancÃ©.
  A banana?
 Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
  Just so weird.
  Is this his house?
 OK.
 Uh, my ex-fiancÃ©.
 I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesnt know. Um actually I did tell Pam and we decided â€˜no. But, then I decided yes anyway. So, Im thinking theres another conversation coming. And, its hard to know when that will be.
  There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
 Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
 That was, that was a surprise.
 Youre welcome.
 By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
 Gravel company?
 Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
 Yeah, you never know.
 OK, Kenny.
 He plays piano?
 Definitely.
 Courtside seats. Sixers.
 It was an away game.
 No.
  Um, ok.
  Oh, heres one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
 You heard that one.
 That I thought we were millionaires.
 Thats all right.
 You all right?
 Ready?
  John Stamos.
  Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And whatd they say? Thats awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
 Its not even real yet. And Im not gonna tell her til its real.
 Im sorry. This is for a news audition?
  I can feel you looking at me.
 Uh-huh.
  That didnt happen. You wouldve told me right away.
 Uh...
 God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
 Dont worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which Ive been wanting to try.
 That was really good, Darryl.
 Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed meâ€”.
 I deserved that.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
I think I got it right here.
 You got it.
 Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first.
 Getting my wife a week off from work.
 Awesome, right?
 Well, I dont know about the rest of you but Im just gonna say it. Im nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.
  â€œSide effects of EMF include headaches...â€
â€..breast pain...â€
 Oof. â€œInfertility.â€
 Ah! Theres my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
 What?
 Thats impossible, cause thats a brand new bag... Oh my god.
 Im gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
 You mean Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. Well be getting a dozen.
 Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
 What?
 What?
 Alright, alright, gang. Lets just settle down. Youre yelling in her face.
 Just...you good?
  Im so sorry for all of this.
 Ill get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
 Pam, Im really sorry. I- Im really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking?
 Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
 Andy!
 Youre the boss. Dont you think wed all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
 What are you talking about? Youre not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
 Next stop Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also.
  So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
 You got it.
 If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
 Hes just mad that were all having fun.
 Hes fine. Hes indestructible.
 Lets go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
 OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
 Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
 Oh no, Im gonna push him. You know why? Because youre getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? Hes trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we wont get there. Is that what we want?!
 What do we want?!
 When do we want it?!
 Thats impossible.  Dwight!
 What are you doing?
 You know hes doing all this on purpose.
 Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
 What?
 Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
 No.
 Ill take it.
 Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
 That doesnt matter.
 Ok...thats not...
 Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, were all kinda like your children?
 Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
 OK. And theyre all dangerously close to not getting pie. And theres only one guy who can save them. Its not me.
 Its pretty good actually.
 We bonded. We got to-
 Dont..
 Dont..
  Pie! Pie! Pie!
 We did it.
 It wont budge.
 Ceces really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
 Its Okay.
 Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses?
 Theres a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
 Gettin a lot of mileage out of this, arent ya?
 Are you sure youre okay with me putting in this much money.
 Youre the best.
 Okay. Ill see you in a little bit.
 Shut up.
 Wow.
 Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
 Oh, I actually talked to my wife and wed really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
 We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in.
 All right.  Awesome. Cool.
 Oh man, it was great. They were great.
 I did, yeah.
 Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
 Ten. It was the full ten.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Yeah. Its a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
 Yeah.
 What is it?
 Um, oh man, I dont actually know.
 They werent really talking that much about money. They just said, Were good with investing and then I...and I...
 No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
 You werent there.
 It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
 Pam.
 Well talk about it later.
 I thought that concert was pretty great.
 Angela, its Halloween. You have to sing â€˜Monster Mash.
 Uh...
 Okay. Well, just forget it.
 Because it is Halloween. So if youre going to sing a concert, its a good idea to throw that one in.
 And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
 Competent.
 Dwight!
 No, you chose yourself.
 Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
  See these forms...
 What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
  Good afternoon!
 Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
 Hi, David.
  Go ahead David, Im listening.
 I cant. I have the thing.
 I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that Im helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time Ive ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
 Yeah, Im here. Are we all on?
  Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
 I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
  Uh yeah. Trust me, Id rather be with you guys.
 Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
   Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
 Im gonna try a different spot. Okay?
 Okay, Ill call you right back.
 What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
 The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
 It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
 Nobody!
 No, no, no.
 Jim Halpert.
 Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
||
 Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But dont worry. Ill figure it out.
 Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
 You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
 What? Yeah, right. As if.
 Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
 I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
  Hey David, how would you like a guy whos not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
 This is gonna be awful.
 I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
 Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while Im gone.
 Yep.
 Oh, great.
 Because were friends.
 Unfair. Whens my birthday?
 How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
 All right.
 You know, truth be told, I think all youll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while Im gone.
 You know, at the end of the day, its really only two days. I mean, Ill be back in the office. Â If you need me for an emergency, call me. Â Ill be there...
 Tell me about it.
 All right. You know what? Â Maybe well just... Well go slow.
 Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
 All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, thats-- thats decorative.
 Still decorative.
 No.
 Dont-- dont-- dont pole people with knives.
 Phyllis! Â Wow.
 Well, were here. Perfect. Â 
 Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
 This is hilarious, but were gonna stop with all--
 Shuckin the peas. Â You should go back to the first part, though. You are Â gonna Â cover for me?
 Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you.
  Im having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
 Well, yeah, but Im wondering if its too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
 I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure Id get in at 500, check into a hotel at about 600 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
 So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you dont know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
 Yes! That, that, that! Were definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
 Done, right?
 Im not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
 Right.
  Were thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
 Whoo!
 Yeah, I think so.
 Uh--
 Best Christmas ever.
 Thank you.
 Cant wait.
 I dont know. Is it what you expected?
 So happy right now.
 Yes, he is finally nigh.
 So hes kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
 Wow! Its my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
 Oh, its like naughty or nice.
 Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
 Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
 But more than once? cause you could have made a mistake.
 Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now youre gonna find out whos--
 Damn.
 Ooh.
  Oh...what was that? Now Im gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh...
 Im probably never gonna see you again.
 Okay, sorry, sorry.
 Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
 Ill call you when I get in.
 All right.
 Love you.
 I think theyre going to the conference finals.
 Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, dont even-...
 I bit my lip at lunch today.
 Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
 Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...
 Whatever. Its not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing thats gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! Thats it, Im going home!
 I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pams face because lets be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
  You sound tired. Everything ok?
 Uhh, a little bit. Its a lot of pressure, you know, but thats what I signed up for right?
 Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
 Ok
 Thanks!
 Love you too. Bye.
 Oh man, thats fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
 Oh no, no, no. Thats ok.  Um Im sorry, is this the conference center?
 You gotta be kidding me.
 Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
 Listen, I dont mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
 Alright.  Oh, sorry. Im so sorry. Its my wife, can I take this?
 Right!  Hey, whats up? Everything ok?
 Its still happening right now actually, so uh...
 Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everythings okay?
 Okay, bye.  So sorry about that.
 I love it.
 Okay, Im Kareem. That makes total sense. Im Kareem. Youre Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
 And thats all?
 No one will believe this back home, but thats okay. Let me show you how its done.
  This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
 Sorry, Stinky, cant do it. Too busy.
 Okay. Theres no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
 Hey, Im in Philadelphia right now.
 Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
 No, I hear what youre saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
 Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
 Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?
 What are you doing here?
 Thats so great!
 Its pretty great, right? I mean, were coming along  Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Denniss timeline
  Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
 Well, I mean, I dont even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so These things go down all the time.
  Are you cool to just hang out?
 Yeah?  You ready?
 Lets do it!
 Mm-hm
 And as you know, I was a paper salesman.  Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.
  Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. Theyre going to make you pay for the fish, and they wanted to know when you can start.
 I think Im a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
 The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
  Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
 ...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
 I dont.
 Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
 Hey.
 Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
 Ceces ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. Ive been working with her on her move. Its called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? Its kind of like this. Its pretty cute, right?
 Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
 Yeah. Even you.
 Bye, Dwight.
 Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
 Hey. I was just about to call you.
 I am still in Philly, actually.
 Its insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so Im stuck here trying to keep him on board.
 Pam, I couldnt get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
 Youre gonna do great. And you know what? Mommys gonna record it. So well watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
 Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
 Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes youre not the best with the phone.
 Bye. Â  Yep. See, youve still got to press â€œEnd,â€ Pam.
 Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but hes gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
 Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, hell be calling in any second.
 Hey.
 We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. Its like everything I did, he just wouldnt go for it.
 I have no idea where were gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
 Can you figure out how to upload Ceces dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
 Youre not serious, are you? You didnt get any of the recital?
 Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
 Oh, great. So well see somebody elses kid with Cece in the background? I mean, its really not that hard to film a video.
 Look, Pam, I dont know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? Its gone. That moments just gone. I missed it.
 Youre not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? Im in Philly. These are my days in Philly. Youve agreed to this.
 Pam, Im not explaining this to you-- Pam, Im not going over this again.
 I dont know how else to tell you, okay? Im doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
 Im doing this just for me? Is that what Im doing? Im doing it just for me. If thats what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
 Well talk tomorrow?
 Okay. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 You couldve just called that an alliance too, right?
 Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, thats only gonna make things worse.
 Im talking to him this afternoon, but dont get your hopes up.
 Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so were scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company Im abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So problem solved. Thanks, guys.
 Im on the phone. Im on the phone.
 Im just gonna call you back. Thanks.
 Im sure hes just nervous.
 Sure, yeah, go ahead.
 Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? Youre clean, right?
 Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You dont listen to it at all because were at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, soâ€”
 Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
 Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
 I need you to breathe in my face right now.
 What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
 I knew it, I knew it.
 I looked at you coming around, and I said, â€œWintergreen.â€
 How is it my fault?
 But its Dwight whos bring in all the weirdos.
 Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”
 I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wifeâ€”
 Oh. Um
 Okay. I cant say that thats not fair.
 Oh, yeah, so well just do that later.
 Uh  Well, its about Athlead. Im sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
 Theres a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor â€“
 Yes, okay. Bye.
 No, thanks.
 Dwight, you cant just hire someone â€˜cause theyre your friend.
 Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If Im not looking south, Im not livin.  Thats what I always say.
 But you know I wouldnt hire any of these all-stars.
 Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
 I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
 Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
 And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
 Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
 Too much now.
 That seems inconsiderate.
 All right. I think that went well.
 So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then thatll print outâ€”Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
 Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
 Okay. Im really sorry I told the guys Id be there for the board meeting.
 Ill call you when I get there.
 All right.
 Take care of my wife. I will be back.
 No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when Im gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
 You couldve just called that an alliance too, right?
 Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, thats only gonna make things worse.

  Hey.
 We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
 And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, its, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
 Im couching it!
 And this dude labels his food. Hes the clean one. And, Im the messy one. How much fun is this?
 Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
  Who is this guy? We are killing it.
 Yeah!
 Nice job, man.
  What?  Oh, man! Im sorry about that.
 Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
 Oh. Its your go-to therm. Oh, man. Thats a bummer. Im sorry about that.
 No, no. If its a big deal, its a big deal.
 No big deal.
 Honestly, I dont mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or...
  OK. Here ya go.
 Hey.
 Yeah. Totally.
  Its mine. Dont worry.
 I dont think you had to.
 I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldnt use that?
 Thats not the point.
 No, Im not making bread.
 Darryl, it doesnt matter. I think you know the point Im trying to make.
 Its all good. Are we all good?
 Whats that cooler?
 Oh, crap. Were those yours?
 Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, thats just Roommates 101.
 Oh. Oh!
  You win.  How good did that feel?
 Its like magic. Or, its like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
 By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
 They are terrible.
 Oh my god. Thats so romantic.
 Oh my god. Thats less romantic.
 Yeah, yeah. No, totally. Thats good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
 Im very excited to see Brian. Brians a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. Im sorry, but you know him. Hes a good guy.
  Hey, Brian.
 What?
 Oh.
 Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, Ive wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And Im really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
 Well, I mean, thats OK. It doesnt mean that its over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
 What?
 Crying?
 I dont know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I dont know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
 Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
 No, youre right. And, and Im not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably dont have any reason to be mad at all because I wasnt there. So, lets just forget about it.
 You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
 Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and Im sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I dont know, drop me at the bus station?
 I just feel like were gonna fight.
 So... how bout lets not?
 Oh, um.  Happy Valentines Day. Sorry, I didnt have time to wrap it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 No problem.
 You really wanna fight on Valentines Day?
 OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
 Hey! There she is.  How you doin?
 You look great.
 Yeah.
 Ok, I know where youre going with this, and this is who I am now. Im a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.
 You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
  Call you right back. What were you saying?
 Ive gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? Youre gonna crush it, youre gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
 Hey, howd the interview go?
 I cant wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, dont eat because Im ordering in.
 Ill make it worth your while, I promise.
 Alright, love you.
 Hey! Back here.
 Si, senor.
 Oh man. Im so sorry. Are you alright?
 Are you kidding? Were in Philly. Were having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. Its from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
 Alright. So, tell me all about it.
 Tell me about the cologne. How much?
 Youre definitely hoarding this by the way.
 Austin Powers.
 Ferris Bueller.
 Not Night at the Roxbury.
 Im sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
 Its fascinating.
 Thats amazing. Well, listen. You cant win em all, right?
 So, next interview has to be better.
 What do you mean? Of course it will. Youre amazing.
  Huh. This is a little out of left field.
 And I have started a business in Philadelphia.
 My condolences.
 OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
  Im sure... Im sure shes in a better place.
 OK.  This is crazy. You cant make a dirt ball.
 OK.
 Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
 Oh man.
 Oh boy, please dont. Lets not let that happen.
 What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
 Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies first baseman.
 Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
 Yeah. So, uh, Ill uh, talk to you later?
 Ok great.
 Bye.
 Hey man, how you doin? Jim Halpert.
 Lets go to the conference room.
 With our firm, youll be building equity for long after theyve retired your number.
 Right?
 Yep.
 Wow.
 Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, its autobiographical.
 OK
 Space dust.
 Sure, yeah.  Hollywood.  Alright.
 Ok, great.
 â€œTogether we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.â€
 Smart.
 â€œBuy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.â€
  â€œBuy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!â€
 â€œMegan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.â€
 Wow. I tell you what, its really strong. I cant wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
 â€œGotta go! Darth Vaders launching a huge attack.â€
 I dont know how wed go about doing that.
 Well look into it.
 We gotta get him.
 Were gonna go get him.
 Were gonna get him.
 Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
 Its a little, uh, personal.
 I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
 Sorry. Iâ€”no, no, no, what I meantâ€”what I meant actually wasâ€”
 You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
 Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couples counseling.
 No, no, no, no, no. Uh, were just starting couples counseling. Uh, which doesnt sound any better.
 Thats all right.
 So how does it work? Its like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or
 Mm-hmm.
 If I didnt do certain things without telling Pam, shed be married to Roy.
 If she can just hang on for a little while longer, Iâ€”this will be so huge for our family.
 What do you mean?
 Thats kind of an impossible question.
 Well, if Pam says she wont go, thenâ€” were gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
 Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
 No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
 Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each others sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pams been doing to run the house while Im in Philly.
 Mmhm.
 Oh, were supposed to call everything we dont want to do â€œopportunities.â€
 An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
 Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasnt out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
 Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
 Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
 Hey thats work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
 Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think thats a little unfair.
 I guess I will swallow my truth.
 I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think were making progress. So Im really sorry that I have to go but lets keep at this. Ok?
 Thanks.
 Bye.
 Hey!  I...
 I love you.
 Im taking some time off from workâ€”well, my other workâ€”because we needed it.
 Its great.
 But that doesnt matter. This does. Its the only thing that matters. Weve had some really nice days together.
 Beesly! Oh, my god.
 Ah, definitely blue.
 For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thinâ€”
 Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I cant give 100% to two things at once you know.
 Huh. Well, you know, you cant have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for whats most important. Thats my new thing.
 Smasher!
 Fireball!
 Thats pretty good. I feel safe.
 Oh, Clark. Im actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
 You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that Im here.
 What?
 Okay. The annex it is. Ill be sitting at your desk if thats okay with you.
 Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
 Oh, wow. But, umâ€”Oh, I get that.
 I get it.
 Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You dont watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
 I really felt like I almost lost her, andâ€”and nothing is worth that.
 Again.
 Not at all. It should be Dwight.
 Youre gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uhâ€”
 Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely dont want to meet that person.
 Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
 I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
 If you could help me out, that would beâ€”
 Anything would help.
 Oh, also, while youre at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
 Wow, thatsâ€”
 You come so prepared. Aspirin.
 Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. Its really great.
 No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
 I wouldnt be too sure about that. Just saying.
 Wow, hey.
 Whats up?
 Okay.
 Really?
 Yeah, totally you did.
 I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
 All right? Im gonna wait.
 Im sure you did not. What was your question?
 Well, then, I should figure out things to do while Im waiting.
 Look whos back.
 Weeknights are actually tough just becauseâ€”
 Thats true, yeah.
  Congratulations, buddy.
 So.
 Lets hear it.
 Nope. Cant accept that job. Its not a real job.
 Ill tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one Id be proud to take.
 Dont get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
 Oh, dont look at me cause I think youre making a terrible choice.
 You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
 No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? Whats up?
 What kind of offer?
 What?
 Oh, my god!
 Wow, that is wow.
 Yeah, we did. Hey, how longâ€”how long do we think thats gonna take?
 Oh, man. Yeah, I cant do it.
 This, man. I cant do this to Pam.
 I know. And I cant do it.
 Sales form for you to sign.
 Aw, thanks, man.
 No.
 Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
 All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay.
 Yeah.
 I will. I will.
 The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and thats final. I almost lost Pam over this business. Im not risking that again.
 He welcomes you.
 Your agenda-taking pleases him.
 Lets not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if youre expecting a fax today, please dont yell out, â€œMichael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.â€ Ok? Thats nonsense.
 Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
 Thats obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
 Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Whos excited?
 I love Star Wars as much as the next guyâ€”
 My god, Im so sorry. Well this might make up for it I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
 Potential future nonsense.
 Im gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youve got a regional manager.
 Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
 But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
 Exactly.
 Yeah, right. I mean, unless theyre willing to pass some tests.
 Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
 Nothing.
 Members of the office, hear ye.
 Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
 This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but thats for fueling only. No savoring.
 He envies you.
 Alright.
 By 200, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
 A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
 985,000,000,000,017.
 Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
 Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
 Thats exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
 Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
 Come on.
 Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”
 Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
 Do you want a corn dog?
 Well see. You are an assistant whos just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
 Uncanny.
 An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
 Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
 Yeah. Its real. Its the only way youll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! Shes through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
 Look at that form.
 Uncanny.
 You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingâ€”none of these people are good enough.
 What Im about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ive ever said.
 Is-
 The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
 I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  Thats it. You look really, really good.
 Hey.
 You all right? Whats going on?
 Yes, Im happy.
 Yeah.
 What?
 Pam.
 This was my decision, not yours.
 You didnt force me.
 You did not force me to do this.
 I dont know how else to tell you.
 Resent you?
 Is that really what you think?
 Not enough? I dont know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know its against the rules but Im gonna need a favor from you guys.
 You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
 Perform a test.
 Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so Im gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, dont worry, hes the best in the biz.
 Unless you think he cant handle it.
 All right.
  Thank you.
 Well Ive been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldnt believe me, so  I needed a little help.
 OK, I dont have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
 I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
 Ok, um, this is â€”Ill be right back.
 What do we got?
 Wow! Congratulations, thats a really big step.
 Right in the sweet spot. I think youre gonna be really happy.
  Thats a lot of pros.
 So what is the problem?
 I dont know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time Ive been faced with a tough decision, theres only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
 Love.
 You watched it.
 Well, then I guess youre ready for this.
 Its from the teapot. Everything youll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything.
 Here we go.
 Umm.
 I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, its good for the environment too.
 Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
  Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
 And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
 Okay, the limos gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready â€˜cause I want to pack in a lot.
 Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwights night, okay?
 Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. Hes putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years Ive done nothing but trick and prank him but tonightonly good surprises. â€œGuten Prankenâ€.
 Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isnt going to show up?
 Mose has been weird? Thats so unlike him.
 Hey man, good to see you.
 Hey!
 Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? â€œGuten Prankâ€ number one.
 And Jim will say nothing.
 Yeah?
 Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limos here. Lets do this. Change if you need to.
 Get out.
 No, Dwight. Youll be doing the whacking.
 Of course I did.
 Yeah!  Guten Prank number two.
 Private Room.
 Enjoy, enjoy.
 Okay, man, easy.
 Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
 Oh, its the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angelas been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
 They think it was Mose.
 Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub youd ever set foot in in this town?
 Mm, hey driver. Why dont you take us to 3030 Adams?
 Is that Mose?
 Ooh.
 Nope, not a prank. I think its time for you to bury the hatchet.
 Okay, just talk.
 I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrows his wedding day. You cant be anything but happy on your wedding day.
 Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
 Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or
 Right.
 Am I the only one thats nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
 Doesnt seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
 She pays me back every day just by being my wife so thats fine.
 O-Kay.
 Um, you know what, I actually didnt handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
 You ready?
 Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um I dont know how to tell you this, but we have a little bit of a problem.
 The minister just told me that its tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
 I havent heard of it, obviously. But Im out because I am significantly younger than you-
 I think its definitely Well, okay. Either way
 Either way, Dwight I cant be there for you. Im sorry.
 I justreally wish there was something I could do.
 Best prank ever.
  See, now you dont owe me anything.
 I gotta get out of this dress.
 Whats going on?
 No, really, whats going on?
 Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
 Thats why its so clean.
 I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
 Oh okay. Where would we go?
 I promise you, you dont have to do this for me.
 The last
  Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about
 You wanna do this?
 You really want to do this?
   Oh my God!
 Hey, Darryl.
  Lets go outside
 You know what? Maybe we should talk.
 Athleap.
 Dwight, come on. Dont end on a bad note.
 Hey, and if youre ever in Austin...
 There it is.
 Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakesand grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And thatsan amazing gift.
 Thanks Phyl.
 I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didnt love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupidwonderfulboringamazing job.
