 Oh, I told you. I couldnt close it. So...
 Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
 My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... Im boring myself just talking about this.
 Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
 Nothing.
 All right. Take care.
 Yes?
 Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
 Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 Its not on your desk.
 Why not?
  Well see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesnt bother me.
 If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pams favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
  How do you know it was me?
 OK. Dwight, Im sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
 Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
 Thats why were all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
 Tonight, hopefully.
 Whats going on?
 You know what? You should come with us. Because you know were all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Um... Whats in the bag?
 No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
 Do I think Ill be invited to the wedding?
 Hey.
 How are things?
 Oh no, I just decided not to. Hows your headache?
 Good. Good.
 Thats great
 Yeah?
 Am I walking out?
 Yes, I... Do you want to...
 Great. Let me just...
  Oh, Roy.
 Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here.
 Thats the thing. Its very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? Im sorry, Mr. Decker. I think Im losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I dont know. Hold on one second.
 Do you really have to do that right now?
 Mr. Decker, Im sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? Thats it. Perfect. So what I was saying...  Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
 That is not the expression.
 This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. Im not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year Im pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. Im getting cocky. Right?
 Solitaire?
 Six on seven.
 So then, why didnt you do it?
 Who doesnt love that?
 Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
 You know what? Im actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
 Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
  Uh, is that it?
 Hello? Hello?
 What are you watching?
 Really?
 No way. I think she likes this stuff.
 Yeah, you know, shes engaged, but...
 Oh, yeah. Shes hot.
  Mr. Decker, we didnt lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... whats that? No, we didnt close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. Thats actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I dont blame you.
  Um... Hey.
 Hey.
 We can go.
 Thats fine.
 Uh... Not a bad day.
 Last night on Trading Spouses, theres... have you seen it?
 Interesting, whats that like?
 Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
 Gosh.
 That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
 Yeah. I just dont think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
 Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
 Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, Id have to throw myself in front of a train.
 It says "workspace".
 If its the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
 You are not my superior.
 I thought it was a workspace?
 You cut more than you had to, didnt you?
 Well, why did you do that? You work here, dont you want good insurance?
 OK, well, if youve never been sick, then you dont have any antibodies.
 OK, you know what Dwight? We cant write our diseases down for you because thats confidential.
 Workspace.
 Wait. What are you writing? Dont write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cause Im suffering from both.
 Oh, great.
 I thought you said you were inventing diseases? Thats spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
 Thank you.
 What are you talking about?
 OK, whoa. Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that theyre fake?
 Absolutely not.
 No I didnt.
 Killer nanorobots?
 Sounds tough.
 Do you?
 Mmm hmm.
 Yep.
 Good luck.
  Jim Halpert.
 Who is this?
 No, you cant fire me.
 OK, can you hold on? Im getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert.
 Hey Pam! How are you?
 Im doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
 No, not at all.
 I have nothing to do.
 Oh yeah?
 The mall?
 Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
 Absolutely, I do.
 At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
 To what?
 And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, heres a way."
 Oh yeah.
 I think it has something to do with Survivor, but Im not sure.
 Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
 What? No.
 What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. Im using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
 Well Im trying to. Do you see what Im doing?
 But listen, Im going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
 All right.
 Yeah, what do you think thats about?
 Im on it.
 You are not going to believe this.
 Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
 Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
 Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
 Toby and Kevin, theyre trying to get Angela kicked off.
 Well, I dont know, if Kevins in accounting, and Tobys in Human Resources and theyre talking...
 I love their sandwiches too.
 Their bread is very good.
 OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
 Because were strong, Dwight. Because were strong.
 Sure, whats up?
 Oh no?
 No, will not, Im not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
 That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
 OK, heres the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Merediths birthday.
 I know, but its gonna be a little tough because theres no good place to hide there.
 What? What?
  Great.
 Good.
 Wait, this isnt gonna work. The lids open.
 I cant do that. You wont be able to breathe.
 Thank you, thank you. OK.
 So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
 Right... Thats good.
 Pam, hes in a box. Hes downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. Im serious. Go down there and work your magic.
 Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscars charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
 Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. Its gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I cant even calculate what youre gonna have to give.
 OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
 OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
 But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
 If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
 No, no, dude, no.
 No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
 God, I dont even, I dont even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... weve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
 Its stupid. Its, its just office pranks.
 God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power Ive ever seen go to someones head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
 Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
 Thats him.
 Uh, I heard it.
 Ill do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
 Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And Im, yeah, Im looking forward to playing. You know, I think Im gonna impress a few people in here.
 You coming down?
 You gonna wish me luck?
 Whoa.
 Is that trash talk from Pam?
 Oh.
 Well, Im going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because Im also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
 I think Ill see you at the mall. Yeah.
 Have a good game man.
 Really? I thought Id take Roy.
 My bad.
 You know what? Let me take Roy.
 Take it easy.
  ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
 I didnt sign anything.
 Cute, sure, yeah.
 Shes not really my type.
 Hmmm, I dont think so. Nope.
  Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
 Too late, Kev.
 Pam and I are good buddies.  Im sort of Pams go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
 Shed be perfect for you.
 So, what? Youre Assistant Regional Manager.
 Well, you know what Dwight? Hes your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
 Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, Youre both um, salesmen. I mean thats something right there.
 Its all gold.
 Alright. Heres the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
 You buy a purse.
 Dwight, thats not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
 Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
 Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
 No. You dont need the bathroom. Youve got it. Go.
 Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever youre doing because this is going to be good.
  Hi my names Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
 Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
 Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
 Im going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
  Here he comes, shhh...
  Good.
