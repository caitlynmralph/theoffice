  You have no idea how long Ive wanted to do that.
 No Im not drunk.  Are you drunk?
 Are you really gonna marry him?   ...Ok.
  I cant say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
  Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think thats pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you cant beat that view... right?
 Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
 OooOK.
 I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I dont think any of them actually know my real name.
 Oh, I can do that.
  Whats gay-dar?
 I miss that.
 Its really good to see you, man.
 Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
 No, its not. I did. Yep.
 You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
 Oh, Dwight. Ive missed you so much.
 That is a lot of liquor.
 And a dart board.
 Oh, no, sorry, its an inside joke. Theres this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? Youd just have to be there.
 Yeah.
 All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
 Oh yeah?
 Oh, tell him I say hi.
 Hey, how is... Toby?
 Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
 Michael, its really not a competition.
 Michael.
 Dwights room key. And... Dwights room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
 Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I dont even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
 Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
 Can I get a drink?
 Can I get a drink?
 Yeah.
 Michael...
 Wait, wait. I didnt transfer because of you. Youre a good boss. Youre a great boss.
 Michael, its not about... I transferred because of Pam.
 No, I just... I heard something about that. Its just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
 Nope, thats okay.
 Thats all right.
 Yeah. Okay, maybe.
 Hey.
 How are you?
 No, we used to. Now were friends.
 At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and theyre all really into it.  Im told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didnt play many video games in Scranton.  Instead wed do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
 Im just killing Germans, any way I can.
  Wait, are we playing teams?
 Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.    Ok, see you next week.  Bye.   Again?
 Oh, Im sorry I dont know... what were talking about...
 Um, sniper rifle?
 Im sorry what are you whispering about?
 Im trying---
 Oh.
 What?
 Wow. Psychopath.
||
 Oh yeah, definitely.
 Whats up?
 Oh.
 Mmm, thats where youre wrong.  Im your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that were not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
 Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market.
 Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
 Really?
 Oh, theres no game.  Were just trying to get these chips for Karen.
 I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
 And then we checked the fax machine.
   Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herrs salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and havent ... . yeah.  You have em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  Ill call you back.  Shut up .
 Nice!
 Sounded good.
 Whered I find what?
 I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
 What?
 Is it?
 No, I didnt. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didnt take your chair.
 So I guess I cant get up.
 Sure.
  Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
 Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
 fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
 Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
 Ah, hey.
 Hi.
 Sorry, I forgot Kevins extension. Its a fantasy football thing.
 And I was just going to go through the system cause I didnt think youd be there. Why, why are you still there?
 Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
 So...
 Oh, Im sorry. Go ahead.
 Oh, good.
 What time is it here? Um, were in the same time zone.
 How far away did you think we were?
 Yeah. I have a question for you.
 How many words per minute does the average person type?
 Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesnt even type 90.
 Ok, I said average.
 Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
 No.
 65. Ok, no need to laugh.
 Respectable?
 Right.
 Ok.
 Yeah.
 I know!
 No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
 No, youre making this up!
 Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
 And how many kitchens?
 Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
 Most apartments these days have like three.
 Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
 Pam?
 Pam?
 Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
 Oh, no no.
 Yeah, uh, well.
 Ok.
 Yeah. Bye Pam.
 Sorry.
 I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
 Thank you.
 Scuse me?
 Wow.
 Yup.
 Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
 Whats that?
 Yep.
 Oh, Holy Mother of God.
 Good.
 Oh.
 Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
 Okay.
 Oh.
 Im a drunk driver.
 Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
 No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if thats all right.
 So good.
 Hey.
 Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
  I dont have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwights stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."
 Really? Wow... thats bad.
 Well, I work here now.
 I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, its going to be weird that its all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
 Hey, do you have a second?
 I know its not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know whos coming over here from Scranton?
 Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
 What does that mean?
 Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
 Wow.
 Thank you.
 No, its just Im not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
 No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And Im not really ready to revist that, I dont think.
 Okay.
 I really dont know.  How you doing with all this?
 Youd actually move to Scranton?
 New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you Id move to New York?
 Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... its not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
 Okay.
 The Stamford branch is closing and everybodys just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
 Yeah.
 You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
 Sounds good Andy.
 Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, Im out of here. See you later?
 Right.
 Okay.
 Hi, Im Jim. Im new here.
 Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how wed never met...
 Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
 You, too.
 Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, were friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
 Hey, Dwight.
 Okay. Sounds good.
 I dont know what youre talking about.
 No. Looks good.
 Im not.
 I am.
 Okay.
 Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
 Oh, Im sorry. Are you sitting here now?
 Oh.
 You know, man, its really youre call.
  Let me get that for you.
 This one taken? No. Good.
 Hey, Toby!
 How are you, man?
 I just wanted to say hi.
 Oh. Is that like your new thing?
 No. Its cool.
 All right. Good to be back.
 All right.
 No problem.
  ...what?
 Kelly!
 Really?
 Great. Whats new with you?
 Oh, this looks promising.
 It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. The Scranton Witch Project.
 Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
 Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
 You feel good?
 All right.
 Hey!
 Oh yeah. Im trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
 Well, Im evolving, Pam.
 Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. Im uh just still getting settled.
 Okay.
 Nope. Youre not interrupting anything. Nope. Im...
 Dont...
 All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
 All right!
 Does he ever.
 Yeah, it does, actually.
  Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
  Whats wrong? You didnt have a good first day?
 Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
 Ok, thanks.
 Hey.
 I thought you had already... left.
 Oh... Good.
 Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
 I just think I should tell you that... Ive sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
 O..ok. Um..good.
 Right.
 Yeah. Good to be back.
 Hey.
 Just about... yup. Now.
 Yes. I have started to see Karen. Its very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
  Jim Halpert.
 ...Okay I cant... help you... with that.
 She is dating Ryan, I think.
 Shes... high-maintenance.
 Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
 ...Absolutely you should.
 I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
 Frisbee-based competitions...
 She...
 Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
 Jonas Salk.
 Justin Timberlake?
 What is that, like... five pounds?
 Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
 Quick question - do you play the guitar?
 Hold on, let me think about that, yes, thatll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
 Yup. Thats perfect.
 Hey.
 Perfect.
 ...Im messing with Andy. Im sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
 ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
 Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... well give her a break. Lets think of someone else.
 Where... did you learn all of this?
 So, not prison.
 Whatd you do, Prison Mike?
 That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
 Well, youre... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
 Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
 Merry Christmas Dwight.
 Wow. What have we got here?
 Dead goose.
 All right.
 Wow. Win-Win.
 Wow. What kind of bike is that?
 But the paints chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
  Oh, I think youre supposed to put a toy
   Carol.
 Its a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michaels a bold guy.  Is bold the right word?
 What?
 Are you serious?
  Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
  You know what? Uh, I really dont think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
 No, because of the promotion.
 It just feels a little bit, like...
 I feel like theres a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
 Will they still air Rudolph?
 Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And thats what you want, right?
 OK, I think I can help here.
 As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
 Could you please keep it down?  Im in session. Ive determined that this committee is valid.
 Permission denied.
 OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
 Yes.
 No, its not.
 Oh,  shes asleep.
 Probably.
 And shes trying to correctly butcher a goose, but shes having trouble coming up with it.
 Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, its pretty much the same thing.
 Im sure theyll want to meet her, too.
 All right
 What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
 Thank you.
 No. She wasnt.
 Well, for starters, Ive known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago.
 Sorry.
 You what?
 Yeah.
 You just had a rebound.
 Yeah. Which, dont get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when its over, youre left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
  Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
 Oh no, that would be great.
 Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
 All right, lets get started. Umm... Oh, first off, were supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... lets push cardstock this week. Uh, also...  what is this?
 For what?
 OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
 Oh my God, Dwight, whatre you doing?
 Youre not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
 Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, thats making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! Hes got a knife!
 No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanleys neck?!
  Dwight Schrute is now wearing a babys bonnet.
 Oh my God, Karen, youre right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
 You want to talk about it?
 Yep, its English, its "impossible."
 Yikes.
 Fantastic.
 Hey.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Yes. Um, Im just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
 Really?
 So, I dunno, I just feel likes weve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
 Hmm, what?
 Yeah, I guess.
 Hey, thanks a lot.
 Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
 Urkel Grue.
 Uh, I think you dropped this
 Definitely.
 Hello.
 Yeah, you can.
 For this?
 Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michaels new friend.
 Oh well, Yoy should bring in Long Tim in one day. Shouldnt he?
 Yeah. Right?
 Ok.
 Yup. Ill trade.
 Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
 Seriously? Youre going to sit in the back?
 You still do that thing?
 After you sir.
 Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
 We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
 Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
 We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
 And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
 We can custom make them.
 Sure, thats true we cant compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
  And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
 Hey, Kelly, its Jim.
 Thanks.
 Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
 We should go on a double date.
 Sure. Look at you!
 Beesley, coffee?
 All right.
 Yeah.
 No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.
 Which one was it?
 Cool.
 Oh
 Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
 Congratulations.
 Big deal.
 Ok.
 Pam? Did I ever have a thing for her? No, why? Did she say something?
 Yeah. Ok, heres the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didnt feel the same way. So, it didnt amount to anything, and I left. Im really glad youre here. Kay?
 Hey man.
 Is that you singing?
 Nice job.
 You gonna answer it?
 Yikes.
 Thank you.
 I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
 Hey.
 So Andy is in rare form today.
 Encourage him? Im the victim, okay? Hes fishing for me. Weve got to do something.
 Fine. Party pooper.
 Hey, Ryan?
 You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
 I liked you better when you were the temp.
 Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
 Okay, good. Stay right here.
  Are there any messages?
 So weird.
 No.
 What are you talking about?
 You know what?  Maybe its in the ceiling.
 Okay.
  Oh my God, thats half-inch drywall.
  "Its not freakin funny!"
 Hey.
  Yes.
 Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
 Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
 Hey.
 Ugh.
 Oh yeah.  Why?
 Oh.  Yeah well, I guess theres been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
 Yeah, I know I should.
 No, Im sure youre right.
 Really?
 Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
 Absolutely not.
 Stop.  Thats disgusting.
 Fine.
 Sally.
 Blonde.
 Are you okay?
 Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
 Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
 Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
 Have you ever seen a stripper before?
 Yeah, me neither.
 Hi.
  Oh God.
 Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
 Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  Im glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
 Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
 In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks Ive been conducting a similar experiment.
  Dwight, want an Altoid?
  Altoid?
  Mint Dwight?
 What are you doing?
 What?
 So whats in the box?
 Those flowers are nice.
 Phyllis and Robert.
 You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
 Did you ever see that movie?
 You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
 Hey.
 When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
 Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
 I know. Its very cute.
 Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, its totally hypothetical.
 Heres a not hypothetical. Im really happy Im with Karen.
 Pams with Roy. Im with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin on.
 Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six.
 Im sorry what did you say? So wierd...
 The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. Theres no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well.
 Ow!
 That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. Its white hot.
 What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
 Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
 The glare off Angelas crucifix? Its blinding.
 So... youre cool to just wait here for animal control?
 Cool. Okay. Im gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... theres just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
 Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you cant get out, you dont want anyone to help you?
 Another worm? Like, are they friends?
 Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Oh. Um. I think were good.
 Yeah.
 Why dont I wanna go? Didnt expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I dont know any of these people. Its an obligation. I dont like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
 Yep.
 Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
 Gotcha. Alright.
 Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
 Oh. Hadnt noticed.
 No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
 Oh.
 You stay here and have fun, because Im going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
 Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me.
 So, none of them?
 Really?
 Ok.
 I dont know. Where to begin? My ball.
 I dont know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
 Agoraphobic?
 Really?
 Absolutely correct.
 Kev, have a good weekend.
 Here we go...
 Ok...
 Sounds good.
 Hey...
 I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
 Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
 Okay.  Um... Got you something.
 You dont know what it is.
 It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
 Whered you get that?
 Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left Ive been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
 I cant hear you.
 Still nothin.
 No.
 Nice.
 Okay.
 And what happens in this one?
 Okay.
 Can I have a raise?
  Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
 What?
 I didnt say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
 So, none of that tipped you off?
 Yeah, that was nuts.
 No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
 Well see.  Im sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
 Oh, yeah.  Dont worry about it.
 Ok, if you dont want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
 Boy I---
 Its like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and hes like an eel.  I just cant grab onto him.  Its infuriating.
 Well... yes, thats probably what it is.  So what do I do?
 Thanks, Kev.  Im good though.
 Whats what?
 Wow.  I guess word got around.  Thats a nice... honor.
  Didnt think youd notice...
  I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
 Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
 Whats that?
 No, Im not gonna call you that.
 Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
 Dwight says that he actually doesnt know one single fact about bear attacks.
  Andy!  Nah, thats too far.
 You really wanna bet?
 Ok, youre on.
 No, dont worry about it.  Well just got double or nothin.
 I dont know, well figure somethin out.
 Theres like ten green ones.
 Im gonna say fifty.
 Oh, dont be that person.
 Kevs out.
 Id say like... 10,000 to 1?
 Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
 Oh, excuse me.  Its my... favorite part.
 Oh my God, there
 Oh.  Hes going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
 Hey uh, Michael.  Dont jump on the bouncy castle.  You cant do that, because youre going to get horribly, horribly injured.
 Dwight...
  Its kind of blurry.  Thats better.  Question.  What kind of bear is best?
 False.  Black bear.
 Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
 Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And thats a grand total of...  eleven dollars.
 ... MICHAEL!
  Absolutely.  I couldnt be more sorry about this.
 One more.  Why are you talking like that?
 Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
 All right.
 Yeah, Im definitely gonna go alone.
 Oh, did the press ask for a story?
 Whats that?
 You know her name.
 Its fine.
 What about music?  Do you have any music?
 I was thinkin about more like a CD, or... a CD.
 Lord, beer me strength.
 Did that
 Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
 Which one... is she?
 Wow.
 No, I dont think so.
 Nope.
 No.
 No.
 Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We dont have a
 Andy--- Ohh...
 Oh my God.
 Well... thats not gonna hold up in court.
 All right.
 Not important.  Because youre not dating her.  Because its a felony.
||
 Absolutely.
 And you should.
 Andy... is having a
 "Good luck."
 You want music?
 Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think youll be all right.
  A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 Do you?
 OK.
  Look at that.
 Spot on.
  Hey.
  Oh, whats this?
  "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.
 Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
 Lay it on me.
 Now that sounds serious.
 Which would be me.
 OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
 Oh, you dont want to know.
 OK, Ill call the
  OK.
  Thank you.  The police are on it. They say theyve already had three calls.
 Mm... not really, no.
  Question. Wont that interfere with your other task forces?
 Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
 Why dont you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
 No. Thank you, though.
 Not really. Ive seen a bathroom before.
 I think you mean a girls
 Go crazy.
  Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
 Anna Marias.
 Six-month anniversary. What?
 No, weve been dating for six months.
 Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said shes not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
  That is pretty cool.
 Hey, Dwight. Its Jim.
 No, youre not. Im looking right at you.
 Dont.  I have information about the sex predator.
 I saw him two minutes ago.
 In the womens bathroom, above the sink.
 Really? Not Slytherin?
 I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
  Woah, stop, stop, stop. Theres a hole. Step over the hole.
 Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
  Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes!
 You cant say, or you cant pronounce it?
 What are you doing?
 Yeah. No. Good.
 Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a mans eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
  Great. Yeah, Ill see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
 In well?
 How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
 Wait a minute.
 If this job is in a well, I dont want it.
 I dont!
 Nope.
 Oh, cause I dont want my feet to get burned.
 Thats harsh.
 And that is not the same at all. If youre going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
 Hey, I know what youre looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really dont think I should be considered as your replacement.
 Michael, on Thursday Im going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
 Hey, Kev.
 Thank you.
 Ohhh...
 No.
 No way.
  Andy...
 Nothing.
 Yup.
 Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
 Thanks, Pam.
 Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, lets do it.
 So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early cause we want to spend the night in the city.
 Whoops.
 Hmmm.
 Ah, were gonna go tonight, but were gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
 All right.
 Yeah, Im not going to talk about this now.
 You sure?
 Wow.
 Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else?
 Hm. Really tough call.
 You know what? Why dont you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
 All right.
 Oh hey, Dwight.
 Does my room have cable?
 Can I change rooms?
 Can I have a late checkout?
 Youre not the manager even in your own fantasy?
 Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
 Go.
 Thanks.
 Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
 Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
 Oh...
 Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
 Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
  Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. Its in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. Thats when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
 Oh do you mean when I get the job?
  Whos that?
 Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
 Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really dont have to stay, if you dont want.
 Okay.
 Sure.
 Thank you.
 I should leave.
 Thanks.
 Im sorry, wait, so is the question "Howd I get to be so awesome?"  Because, I dont have an answer for you.
 Yes, absolutely.
 Oh, no, absolutely.
  There you go.
  Whats that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, theres just a  energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.   So thats a... bonus.
  The friendships.
  How are your feet?
 The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
 And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like Ive never really... come back.
 Pam.   Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
 All right.  Then... its a date.
