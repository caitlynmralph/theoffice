  This... is Parkour.  Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. Its pretty impressive.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
 Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
 Wait, theres not gonna be a shotgun?
 No shotgun... cause that changes everything.
 What are you gonna do about it? Theres no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
  You have to stop this.
 I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
 Do you know if its true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
  Youre gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
 Oh, I dont really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
 Yep.
 Are you... interested in her guy friends?
 Okay.
 Really.
 Well you gotta figure this out.
 Yeah!
 You gotta have sex with a woman.
 And a man.
 And then compare.
 Yep.
 On what?
||
  Can I talk to you for a second?
  So, they know.
 I didnt tell anyone! Who did you tell?
 Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
 Yeah, sure, but... whos been saying all that stuff?
 Michael, dont.
 Michael...
  That Pams pregnant.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Four months.
 Nope.
  Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
 If everyone would like to see proof.
 Michael, we only told our parents last week.
 I did. It was inconclusive.
 Dont take it.
 You cant do this.
 That sounds terrible.
||
||
   Sure.
   Ah, this is just me and David, if thats okay.
   Who was that?
   No, I wont.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
   I didnt tell Michael because I thought hed try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
   Sure.
   When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
   Why dont we head in your office to talk?
   Michael, look Ill just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
   Michael, did you say anything?
   Really?
   You will?  Wanna do it right now?
   I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
   How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
   So instead, you screwed me?
   No.
   Hi David.
   Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
    Thank you.
 Ah, ah, ah. Wheres the "please"? Were not animals.
 No, not without a "please."
 Im sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
 Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
 Okay. And how do you feel?
 All right. Did he hit you?
 Did you cry?
 Did you feel like crying?
 Im just gonna write "held back tears."
 If you stop crying, Ill stop writing it.
 Michael...
 Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
 I have noticed that we--
 Thank you. Ive noticed weve been having a lot of conference room meetings.
 And Im wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
 Yes.
 Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
 Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
 I am.
 Right.
 Yes, I agree.
 I just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day.
 You mean on a weekend?
 How about this? I think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential.
 Really? You just agreed to that?
  Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
 Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
 Stanley?
 Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these.
 Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
 Thats not what I meant.
 I disagree.
 Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
 That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
 Thats exactly what Wallace told us.
 Im not bossing you around. Im trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
 Hey, David. You got Jim here.
 Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
 David, I know that Im very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
 Nope, not at all.
 Alright, thanks alot, David.
 You dont have to lie.
 Right.
 Alright. Lets get started.
 Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
 Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
 Its hard to tell so far.
 Im sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
 You just came up with that.
 Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
 Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
 Pro-- no favoritism.
 Ive been studying Michael for years, and Ive condensed what Ive learned into this chart--  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
 You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
 I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
 Im not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
 Michael.
 Look, you have a lot of strengths.
 I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
 But there is a reason why Im here!
 No, its because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
 I dont think youre good at making tough decisions!
 At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when its an unpopular decision.
 But maybe Im here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. Ive been sitting out there, and Ive been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
||
 Could I have everyones attention, please? I have some tough news, so Im just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people wont. Now, what weve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
 Look, you guys are smart, so Im just leveling with you. Im just trying to treat you like adults.
 Ooh, easy. Thats not it at all.
 Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
 Okay, Dwight, you know what? Youd be getting the raise so--
 Wow! Im just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...
 Thank you, Meredith.
 Rank each person individually?
  Well, obviously. Too bad hes a temp and doesnt count, so lets get started.
 Nope. Im numbering the paper.
  Its going really well, actually.
  Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv-- whos that?
 Hes not a part of this. You know that.
 Okay, your move.
 Here we go.
 Okay, youre gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
 I was just trying to be unbiased.
 Uh, on a scale of one to ten, Id say Im about a four.
 Six. You?
 I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
 We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
 I just-- what?
  Michaels my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
  Thank you.
 Whats in here?
 Ooh!
 We would really appreciate it.
 It is really special.
 Well, congrats.
 Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the dont column.
 No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
 Absolutely. Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
 Thats nice.
 Good-bye.
 Yeah?
 Oh, wow. Thats cool.
  Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now thats in my brain forever.
 Lousy Picture.
 Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. Its really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
 And Beesly. Tonight were in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
 I know. Were pretty excited, too.
 I dont like that.
 Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
 Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
 Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because its just going to be blood relatives, I think.
 Pretty sure everyone heard that.
 Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
 Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
 No.
 Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
 Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, cant take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, dont get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didnt need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
 Ive been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time thats all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if youd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
 Pam cant drink? I didnt-- I shouldnt have said that. I dont know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldnt. She shouldnt because shes an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. Thats not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pams pregnant.
 Michael.
 Oh, my God. Please.
 Alright.
 To waiting.
 I cant believe it was me.
 Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
 Im so sorry.
 Oh, my God. Are you serious?
  What?
  What?
  What?
 Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but Im pretty certain Im completely wasted.
 Uh...
  And Dwight.
 Pam, it just happened.
 I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
 No. Lets talk for a long time.
 Thats not how that works.
  I may have told some people that.  Im nervous.  Im about to get married.
  Hey!
  Is this allowed?
  Wow.  You look--
  So beautiful.  Hey--
  Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, youre so pretty.
 And who cares?  Its a stupid veil, right?
 There.  Now were even.
  Well we are here now, so lets just--
  You look great.
  I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew wed need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
 Hello?
 Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
 Look, Were in Puerto Rico, so-
 Hello?
 Michael?
 How did you get this number? Michael, were on a catamaran.
 That sounds bad.
 Im gonna help you through it all right?
 All youre gonna need to  and-  it- and then go to--
 And then youll be saved.
 Just  and then youll be saved.
 A- ah--
 And youll be saved.
 I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please dont call again.
 It was.
 Really was.
 Puerto Rico was awesome.
  Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh.
 Nope.
 Do we have a conversation scheduled?
 Wow, thats... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
 Its a real handsome duck.
 Well, thats great. Congratulations. Whos the lucky lady?
 What?
 Youre messing with me.
 You did not have sex with Pams mom.
 What kind of car does she drive?
||
 Oh my God.  Oh my God.
 Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
 Oh my God.
 Not now, Toby, my God!
 Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
 No, not more than anything.
 Dont call her "the mom."
 Then take a different way home, man!
 Okay, so were good.
 Frank and beans!
 You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
 You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michaels slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
 No, it-
 Uh, I think we should just drop it... cause obviously he doesnt want to talk about it.
 Yes, you do.
 Just take the parrot.
 Okay, back to the old grind.
 Dont-
 Sounds complicated.
  Who wants a hot chocolate?
  Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
 Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
||
  I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwights birthday, what do you think?
  Really?
  I was gonna go with this one.
  And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.
  Yes!  Angela!  Please...
  Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
  Yes.
  Nothing... nothing at all... its all good!
  Barely, I... I dont have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
   Hey...
  Yep...
   Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
   Hi buddy.
  A wooden duck?
  Okay, just to be clear, youre terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
  Silence.
  I wont.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
   Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
  Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
   Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
  Well, we went on a Segway tour and were awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
  Yeah... maybe.
  Youre not, nope.  Nope.
 We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
 Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
 Wow.
 I bet we would.
 Cool.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Who doesnt?
 Oh. Actually, its just gonna be me.
 That is a mistake.
 Alright. Lets clear this up.  Well, theres actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
 Great. See ya then.
 They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
 I absolutely dont understand, either.
 Alright.
 Sure. Michaels a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. Thats what a teacher is, right?
 Dave.
 Dave.
 Yeah. Ive spoken to them on the phone.
 Yes, it is.
 No thanks.
 Mmm-hmm.
 ...and paper.
 Nope. No.
 Hes trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
 I outran it.
 Ill just leave that suit in your office then.
 Mmm... its like Michael said. It was some- something else.
 Truthfully, it wasnt the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
 Ok. Great meeting, everybody. Thats it.
 I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
 No, they dont.
 Maybe if you make fun of yourself itll all go away.
 Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
 See?
 Mm... Im, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and youre gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. Were not watchin this.
 What happened to Do Not Mock?
 That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
 Guys. Michael cant handle this and as your boss Im saying were not watching it.
 What are you doing?
 No.
 See what?
 Oscar, yes. Youre right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
 Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
 Its a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?
 I didnt ask you.  Would you like to talk?
 I shouldve grabbed you. Im sorry. Look, I thought I couldve done todays sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
  Hes alright.
 Thanks Michael.
  Oh man, thats crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
  Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  Ill talk to them.
  Thats okay.
 Its my pleasure.  Hello?  Well thats great.   Turns out the paper was there all along.
  Pams sales are fine actually.
 Wow.
 Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.
 Definitely Grandma.
 Penny for your thoughts.
 Wow.
  Shel Silverstein.
  You set the bar so high.
  Okay, so--
 Stop.
  Hey.
 Inappropriate.
  All the time.
 Yeah.
 She wants it bad Michael.
  I can.
  And I dont support her choice to hit you.
  But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
  I just need some time.
  I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
 No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
  Feel better?
  Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
  OK, so theres no defense for that, good to know.
  OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
  So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
  And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
  Oh my God, hes making you look like such a fool.
  You two are so evenly matched I dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
  Are you serious?
    We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering whats going to happen.
  Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, theyll follow along.
  Thats it.
  That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
  Alright, lets conference room it up!   Heres the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
  Sure Im a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
 Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
  OK, great.
  Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
  I thought we agreed that we wouldnt do things like this.
 Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
  And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
  OK, Im going back to work.
  OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
  Alright guys, its a work day and you guys work here, so lets go do some work.
   Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
  No, youre not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
  Or maybe hes just stuck in character.
  Both.  Theyre both worse.
  Its going to be alright. Were a good company, well figure this out.  Were not going under.
  Michael, not now.
  Michael, can I... OK, Im just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
  Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
  Caleb!
  Today of all days...
  Ill take it.
  Hey David.
  Oh, OK.
  Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
  OK.
  See ya.
  Nothing yet.
  Well there is some bad news.   There has been another murder.
  Conference room everyone.
  No.
  I think today was a good day to have two managers.  Cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, its not because theyre crazy.  Its because theyre doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
  Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 600.
    Really?
  Yeah, I want to go home.
 Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
 The next year he really stepped things up.
 A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
 Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I cant remember.
 I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
 Mmm.
 God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.
 Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
 But if the company doesnt go under then well finally have all our contacts in one program.
 Could go either way.
 Maybe we should just wait and find out.
 Ok.
 Nah. Might as well do it now.
 Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
 Ok. You shouldnt be telling me that stuff and also shouldnt be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
 I care about them and Im just as much of a boss as Michael.  Whats so funny? Im a co-manager.
 Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
 Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
 Who here heard it from Ryan?
 Yes.
 I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?
 I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
 To be honest, I dont know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
 Oh, well I yell. Youve heard me yell.
 Well, that was apple-picking day and theres no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
 Hey, Ryan. Hows it going?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Simple data entry, though. So theres really only one way to do it.
 You know what?
 I think I know the problem.
 I think you seem distracted.
 But, you know what? I came up with something and I think its really gonna help.
 I am, too. Let me show you.
 I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyones attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
 Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
 Right.
  Youre a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once youre in there. Enjoy it.
 Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
 Wow, what do you put our chances at?
 Hmm, sounds risky.
 Wow, thats not such a bad idea.
 Anything else?
 Hey.  Whats up?
 Did you murder someone?
 I think shes okay.
 Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
 Youre not in it at all, because you cant be employee of the month, youre a manager.
 It would look bad.  Sorry.
 Not much.
  Thanks Dwight.
 Youre creeping me out.  Im gonna go.
 Let me guess, you think you should get it.
 Well, in an ideal world...
 Okay, if its all the same to you, Im just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."
 Thats okay, Ill do it.
 Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know youre all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
 Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
 Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I couldve given it to myself because I didnt even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
 Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously Im not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and well figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
 Dwight?
 No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
 Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
 Okay.
 Guys, this isnt some elaborate scam, okay?
 Okay.  That is me, but I didnt order the cake.
 This is Jim.
 Hey, uh David.
 So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  Its been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
 No.
 I really dont know how it happened, David.
 All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
 Yeah.  Thank you.
 Yes.
 See you.
 See you tomorrow, Dwight.
 Too loud.
 Too, too loud. Too Loud.
 Yeah.
 This is all we have.
 No, its not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
 Why would you start so high?
 Three, two, one!
 No.
 We didnt, because we think itd be better to do it together.
 Pam!
 Yes.
 Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
 Yeah.
 Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
 No, Im not gonna do that.
 I think shes doing a good job.
 Im not gonna go tell Phyllis that she cant be Santa.
 Im trying Phyllis. Youre Santa.
 Thats what I want.
 What would Bob do?
 Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
 Can I just talk to you for a second?
 You cant yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap!
 Yup.
 Michael, its Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
 Great!
 Who wants Phyllis as Santa?
 And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.   Can I get you some punch?
  No.
 Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
 What?
 What?
 Wait wait wait, who said that?
 What?
 Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
 Okay. We havent gone under. Weve been sold and that can mean many different things.
 No, you wont, because hes not picking up his phone.
 Oh my God, David. Thats horrible.
 Oh my God!
 Co-manager, actually.
 Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
 Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 1120.
 Well, now we wont get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
 Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. Thats weird.
 But if not, theres always the army. The infantry.
  So youve been shown a nonsensical video. Youre probably wondering, "Whats going on?" Well, youre not alone.
  Ok, this is officially the cutest thing Ive ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
 Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
 I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
 I dont know. I dont know.
 I dont know, I dont know.
 Jerry.
 This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
 No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasnt like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didnt focus on anything in particular.
 Do it.
 We should just go. Hes really uncomfortable.
 What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
 All right.
 There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
 Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, were kind of planners. But were also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
 What?
 Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
 No.
 Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a childrens toilet? Why didnt you just lock the door, man?
 Anybody could have walked in.
 Whoa, whoa.
 Ill take over. Um, what were doing here Michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
 Alright.
 No.
 I dont think so.
 I... Why would you just say something like that?
 Do you even know what that means?
 Um...
 This is way more than I make now.
 I dont think Im gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say theyre not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think Im definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
 Hey, you got a second?
 Actually, yeah.
 Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
 Yeah!
 Really.
 No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
 Why would you do that?
 Mm!
  You gotta do something, man. You cant just sit there.
 What is that?
 Oh. Im fine. Thank you, though.
 Why would I wanna do that?
 For now, Im just gonna go back to work here...
 Yeah. Thank you.
 Hey.
 Well, the grass is always greener.
 Well, its what you wanted.
 For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, Im not really sure what we do.
 Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they couldve just gone and talked to her.
 Thats it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
  Michaels saying hes better at being manager, and I agree, cause hes a better people person, weirdly.
 Alright.
 Yep.
   Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  Im excited.  Oh, definitely.
  Yeah, were slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
  Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if its crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless its a boy.
  Michael.
  Michael, you shouldnt have done that.
  Hmm, that logics air-tight, but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
  Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
    Thats seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
  Are you serious?  Pam.
  I...  Pam, please.
  Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
  So, the plan was seven minutes.  But were calling an audible, because thats her call.  Because shes the quarterback.  Im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
  Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
  Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, thats a big deal.  While were on the subject, why dont I just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check?
  You know, its getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet.
   Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals.
    Oh!  Oh, alright.  Thats a good one.
  Okay, you know what?  Im going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  Hed probably know...
  Alright.
  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, lets go to the hospital.  Pam, lets go to the hospital right now.
  Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
  Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
  No, I dont.
  Oh, and by the way, hate that youre helping her with this right now.  Totally.
  I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously shes gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that Im crazy.  But Im not crazy, shes crazy.  Im not crazy, shes crazy.    Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
    Hey.
  Ah, you know me too well.
  Yeah?  ...  Oh.
  Did you say "she?"
  Mad?  How could I be mad?  Were having a little girl.
  Wow, were having a little girl.  Oh, man.
  Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
  Yeah.
  Alright...  Hey, did you change?
  Oh.  Oh...
  Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
  Lets give it a shot.
  Hey, come on.  Lets go to the hospital.
  Pam, Pam, its time.  Lets go to the hospital.
  Come on, Michael says we should go now.
  Pam.
  You know what?  Lets go.  We got to go to the hospital.
  Hey, are you kidding me?
  If anyone can do this, you can do this.
  Pam, Im scared.  Im real scared.
  The best news is, were going to have a baby today.
  A really awesome baby.
  So lets have it at the hospital.
  How are we doing on contractions?
  Two minutes...
  Michael, I told you.
  No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
  We waited too long!  Two minutes doesnt do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
  Alright, were driving ourselves, actually.
  Alright, I have my wallet.
  Go bags in the car...  Keys, my keys, wheres my keys?
  Okay, I cant find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found em.  Theyre here.
  Okay, Michael!  Focus!
  Alright, here we go!  Youre doing great!  Shell be here soon.
  Michael, come on!
  Okay.
  Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  Well be fine.
  Okay, so what do you want to do?
  Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  Were going to the hospital now.
  Wait, you alright?
  Michael, just go park the car.
  Pams doing great.  Uh, shes ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And shes also fully faced.  Which I dont know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  Its only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
  Okay.
    Doing great, push again.
  No, dont push.  Pull.  Pull.
  Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, shes so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
  No, lets let her rest.  Im sure theres still twelve on each.
  Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
  Shes seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
  Hey, grandmas back.
  Great.
  Oh.  Let me get it.
  I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
  Ready?
  Its so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
  We were just kids.  What did we know?
  Great.
  I think well be okay.
  Ready?  One, two, three...
  I cant.  Shes too strong.  Shes, careful, though.  You dont want to break it.
  I got it.  Alright.
  Nurse!
  How you doing?
  Really?
  Well, youre pushing the milk out, right?
  Wasnt it...  Its kinda like a...  Like that.
  I think youre good.  Doing a good job.
  Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
  Alright.
  Its going to be alright.
  Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
  Oh, hi.
  Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
  You see that?  Im pretty sure shes...  Hi.
  Yup.  Really great.  Whens she available?
  Are you sure it doesnt hurt?
  Yup.
  Yeah.
  Perfect.
  I think she will.
  Well figure it out.
  Thank you.
  Please do.
  What?
  Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
  No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
  Okay, Ill just go get the other guy.
  Hmm?
  Okay.  Sshh.  I know.
  Thats amazing.
  Thats awesome.
  thats great.
  Mm-hmm.
  Hey.
  What?
  Okay, okay.
  Perfect.
  Ha ha ha.
  We definitely are.  At 300, right?  You said we could stay until 300?
  Half hour.
  Yes, car seats right there.
  Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
  Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I dont...  I dont think she heard me.
  Are you really sure we should be leaving?
  But you hear the baby crying, right?
  Uh, its in the lot.
  Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
  Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
  You used my move, didnt you?
 Oh, thank you!
 Hey...
 What do we got here?
 Of course.
 Hm hm.
 Okay.  Just gotta...
 Morning!
 No.
 No.
 No-no-no-no-no.
  Is this yours or mine?
 Good Lord!  I cant believe Im missing this.
 Okay. Love you. Well talk soon.
 It is. Big time.
 Pretty amazing.
 Oh its tough being here for a lot of reasons.
 Is that what happened to you?
 Thats a common mistake.
 And Im actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
 What?
  Right.
 Yeah thats great. Great.
  Whens the last time you upgraded your printer?
  Please stop that!
 Can you grow up?
  Whether its this time or next time.
  Yeah.
 No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
 You know, can I call you back?
 That would be great, thank you.
  No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
 I am not surprised that Dwights using my baby to steal my desk. Im a little surprised that its working.
 Hey Jo, its Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 730 with a very important client. And its so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
 You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
 Okay.
  Thanks again by the way.
 Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you.
 Oh!
 No, its not. They call it Quad-Desk.
 Oh my God. Were going to have to re-name it then arent we?
 No.
 Is he you?
 Where did you take that?
 Oh my God, thats right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
 Sure. That they should do one.
 Whos that?
 John Dillinger.
 Captain Crunch.
 At the Yankees game. Yeah.
 I had a little better reason to believe that... Youre right. Youre right. Well, youre not right, because Johnny Depp...
 ...in your condo complex.
 M. Night Shulman?
 Oh, sorry, wait one second.
 This is actually a big potential sale, so...
 You writing your name over there?
 Thats good. You know, with the kid.
 Alright, here we go.  Michael...
 Michael -  Great.
 Whatd you get?
 Alright!
 Hey.
 So Im going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-ones going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
 Alright. So why dont you just give me my share of the leads, and Ill start making some calls?
 Hey, alright.
 Ahh, these arent leads. What are they?
 I dont think you understand -
  This ones a map.
 I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
 Oh my god, I couldnt envy you more.
 Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - thats just unfair.
 How about this one - When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.
 I love you.
 Michaels stupid scavenger hunt.
  Lincoln.
  It involves you too.
 Phew! Cant wait for this day to be over.
 Just all the - drama.
 Between the - us and you guys. Its unnecessary, right?
 Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
 I have new baby pictures.
 Shes wearing a onesie
 Didnt we kind of start it?
 Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
  I dont think we need opposed.
 Ill text Pam. Shes really good at this stuff.
 Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
 Alright. Then were back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, Im for it.
 No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody!
 No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is really sorry.
 Yes! We do.  Eclairs.
 - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
I made a sale.
19.  I had a really hard work out this morning.
Wow.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pams at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Good one.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
I did not see this coming.
Okay.
Why?
Youve been gone for a long time.
Easy.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Would you like to be our fourth?
All right.
So what do you think?
About Julie?
Yeah.
So you like her?
So Pam was right?
About you two hitting it off.
Hey, youre supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
You want to just make a run for it?
What is happening?
Michael, you dont have to do this.
 Wow. Maybe we should tell her that hes not normally like this.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
It stopped.
All right.
See ya. Nice girl.
You all right?
Actually, you didnt.
 I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
 Whats up?
 Dwight, dont be gross.
 Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."
 "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasnt been on in many cookies."
 I think you need to go a little easy. You cant just suspend someone form work.
 And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
 Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
 Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
 All right, so Ill finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
 Yeah, or maybe we dont even need that.
  Thats a good point.
 Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
  I dont even know who you are anymore.
 Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, Im Jim.
 How are you?
 All right.
  So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So its a tradeoff.
 Hold on one second.
 What?
 None of this is time sensitive.
 No.
 Well, maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work.
 Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
 What?
 What was that?
 Pam, you know hes not gonna get anywhere, and hes gonna blow our sale.
 Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
 Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we dont have a lot of flexibility.
 Yeah.
 Whats that?
 I dont... I dont think so.
 What if shes just flirting with you to get a better price?
 She does not like him.
 cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
 Well, the joke was on you.
 It is totally insane.
 Nobodys for.
 Okay.
 What?
 Wait.
 Michael. Michael.
 Michael.
 No.
 What?
 Stop what?
  Yeah. Thats what were doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
 Yup. Thats exactly what we did.
 Its a pen.
 You do?
 But you didnt believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
 Thats interesting. Wow, its a little early for ice cream, dont you think?
 Oh, my God
 You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
 Michael, no...
 You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now.
  What?
 Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
  Nice effort.
  Thats... not okay.
  Stanley, please, this is serious!
  So were gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
  Exactly. It happened in Big.
  Im really too tired to do this.
  Then lets just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
  We can order in from Hooters.
  Billy Joel Rock Band.
  Now youre just being hurtful.
  Pam.
  Yeah, well its really warm in here. Its like a sleeping bag.
  Sorry about that.
  Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
  Excellent. Go for it.
  Right? So, uh, lets uh...
  Now, were those for the team?
  Ah.
   What about an energy drink or something?
  Well, it doesnt mean I cant drink it.
  A place?
  Okay.
 So instead of working, you want...
 Okay.
 What was you? You were the leak?
 Uh-huh.
 Whyd you do that?
 Yeah.
 Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
 This is a very good idea. This is good. Lets get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
 Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we dont definitely know it was Andy.
 Really?
 I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, thats the point.
 Hey, listen man, you cant take it personally.
 No... sport.
