    Really, nothing?
  Ah, they moved the shower.
  No, I didnt.  You know why?
  Because most of the time, friends dont talk about other friends butts.
  But what have you learned about her?
  Nice.
  Well, I tried.
  Ill just go later.
  So you have the directions.
  You have a toothbrush.
  You have a cell phone charger.
  Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
  What happened?
  Call me when you get in.
  Bye.
  Why havent I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didnt want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pams always said she doesnt want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. Im not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
  I cant believe Im saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. Its because Holly is kind of a major dork.
  I dont really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
  When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
  All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this  Go to applications--
  All right!
  So what is going on, girl in the computer?
  Uh-huh.
  Thats not what that is.
  I would like to lose 65 pounds.
  Cryogenics. Beer me five.
  All right, Im taking off.
  Nope, just going to see Pam.
  Maybe put up some shelves.
  OK, thank you for ... this.
  No.
   Hi.
  Oh, thats so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pams new art? Its right there. Check it out.
   Some girl came into Pams room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So Im in here waiting it out.
  Well thats great.   Youre talking about your court ordered community service?
  But he did, right?
  All right.
  Nope.
  Mmm.
  How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
  No, youre definitely the problem.
  Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
  Fair question.
  See, youre always saying theres something wrong with society, but... maybe theres something wrong with you.
  Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that Im convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I havent seen her in 10 days.  Hows your summer?
  So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
  I know.  I suck.
  Dwight says "Hi."
  Now he is saying "Hi" louder.
  Umm...
  Hey, can you go to IM?
  OK.
  Im gonna write you up for not working.
||
  Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
  Perfect.
||
  I just... couldnt wait.
  Pam, will you marry me?
  So?
  Hey, sorry everybody.
  Hey Dwight.
  Whats up, Meredith?
 Alright.  Ill tell everybody here that you say hi.
 Why, what happened?
 Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didnt tell them.
 I just didnt, you know, want a deal.
 OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
 Nope.
 Thank you Angela.
 Yes.
 To get married.
 Yep.
 Nice.
 Dwight, youve really never stolen any company time?
 Jackpot.
  Yawn.  Four seconds.
 Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so... Im just making sure.
 Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
  One second.
 Hey, Andy.
 By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
 Actually not.  It was really so-so.
 I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
 You know, its weird.  Its practically a shot for shot remake.
 Storys kinda bland.  Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
 He has not stopped working for a second.  At 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 132 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I havent even started work.  Its exhausting, being this vigilant.  Ill probably have to go home early today.
  19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
 So I guess I can assume that was personal.
 So maybe youre not completely ethical after all.
  Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through  delusion.
 Right, the one from England.
 Oh. Right, that style.
 OK...
 Wait, whos Sarah Kayacombsen?
 OK.
  No... way!
 Ha ha. Thats hilarious?
 Who, Stacy?
 Uh...
 OK, Ill ta...Ill talk to you later.   That was a good story.
  Jan.
 What do we have here?
 Really...
  Hey!  You busy?
 OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jans shower is going on right now, and shes singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyones just staring at her.
   The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - shes been singing for the last twenty minutes!
 Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
  Hey, its Jim.  Leave a message.
  Hey, its me.  It is 503.
 You must be out or something.
 Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
 Hope you didnt have any major laundry issues.
 Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
 Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, Im just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
 Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
 I miss you.
 We were robbed last night.
 So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 300 in the morning.
 Im on minute six of this message.
 The future mother of my children.
 Do you need us for any of this?
 5 dollars.
 I can see that.
 Another round, boys? Great.
 Hey man.
 Oh, I wouldnt-
 Im good. How you doing?
 Yeah, okay.
 Oh, shes good actually.
 Shes, um, shes in New York. Shes at an art school.
 Yeah, shes doing really well.
 Shes engaged, um... to me.
 Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
 Yeah, Id say shes happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 800 AM.
 What?
  I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.
  No. you know what? No. Because... Im not that guy. And  we are not that couple.
 Dave.
 You are?   A cat?
  Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
 Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
 Oh, Ill walk you out.
 All right. Well see.  No.
 I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
 Hey, how are you?
 Good to see you.
 All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
 Thats not really true. Theres a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
 Wow, thats- thats a little rude. Whats your deal?
 Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. Shes a trumpeter. And, look at her.
 That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
 Love that one.
 Here you go again! What is your deal today?
 One.
 Half.
 Also good.
 Pete couldnt make the Mets. Shes at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
 Pam, dont worry about it.
 Guys, what is going on?!
 Well, Ill be the judge of that. What do you got?
 That is good.
 Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family."
 Yeah, wed never do that.
 You wouldnt tell your mom?
 Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldnt know it from looking at her, but Pams a gold-digger.
 Aww.
  Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
 Nope.
 You must be really proud.
 Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
 OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee thats in here and you could use  uh, oh -- Snoopy.
 How can you even be sure?
  Make the face.  Yeah, I dont see it.
 Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
 It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
 How was your meeting with Michael?
 Was it your scores?
 Mm-hmm.
 Of course.
 Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
 Theres the charm.
 That is me. Wish me luck.
 Thanks.
 I love you, too.
 Im not talking to you.
 What?
 Did my scores drop a little?
 Are we even sure thats my file?
 Well, theres got to be an explanation.
 Yeah.
 I think you mean smug
 Michael, Im just trying to --
 I need a decent bonus, because Im actually in the process of buying my parents house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, its that you cant go wrong buying a house you cant afford. Pam doesnt know about the house, so its... a fun surprise.  Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
 A little bit. ... Worth it.
 Microgement.
  Hello?
 Wow, thats great, because I need paper.
 Wow, this is my lucky day.
 I am Bill Buttlicker.
 How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
 Would you hold on one second? Thats my other line.
 Hello?  No, Im just on the phone with this stupid salesman. Hes so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.
 Sorry. That was a family emergency.
 You know what? Thats private.
 Sorry, youre going to have to speak up a little bit louder. Im hard of hearing.
 Youre gonna have to talk louder.
 Son, you have to talk louder.
 Louder, son!
 Now, you listen to me, sir.
 The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
 Im irate right now.
 Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?
 Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
 Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what Im going to do? Im going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
 There is one condition, Michael.
 You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
 Dwight. Dwight.
 Are you serious?
 OK, what are you --
 Whats that?
 Whos they?
 In this car?
  What are you thinking?
 The mob, maybe NASA.
 Is there some evidence?
 How many shoes do you need?
 Im not talking to you.
 Pam.
 No, shes not.
  OK.
 Easy.
 Lets just -- Lets head back to the desk.
 Good one.
  Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
 Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
 Hey, how are you and Darryl?
 Bye.
 What was?
 No, actually.
 I dont think so.
 Hey, hows things?
 Yeah?
 Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
 Wait, thats pretty weird.
 Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
 No. What party?
 I wasnt. But thank you.  Do you know anything about this party?
 Well, I cant be the only one who didnt --
||
 Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
 Is that it?
 OK, Im gonna assume that was it. Heres the thing I think youre right. I think it was Kelly. I think shes mad at us for not coming to her party.
 Probably just Kelly.
 Thats what Im saying.
 You were right.
 You were right.
 You knew it.
 You knew it the whole time, buddy.
 Wow.
 No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Lets talk about this.
 We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
 Whos that?
 Oh, thats gonna be great. Whos Chuck Close?
 Thats it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
 Im gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
 Dont.
 Why are you telling us this?
 Where are you going?
 Where is it?
 Okay.
 Six point five days.
 Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
  Are you sure?
 Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
 Okay, okay, its no big deal.  So youre not a computer geek.
  W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
 Its not--- Its not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
 And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
  You okay?
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Love you too.
  How does everyone know already?
 Excuse me?
 Im gonna grab a cup of coffee.
 Thanks man.
 I missed you.
 Welcome back.
 So why did you come in here?
 Why is that, why is that weird?
  Shes probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
 Toby works here again.
 Oh no.
 You dont know.
 You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if hes, see if hes back.
 Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didnt tell you that.
 Thats really not cool.
 Yeah, I guess technically Kev, youre right.
 Todays a big day.  Todays the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But its my parents house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  Its got shag carpets.  I mean you cant blame my parents it was the 70s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.   Shes gonna love it.  Right?
 Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
 Oh thanks, Phyllis.
 Oh, its on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
 Definitely we should.
 Mmhmm, yeah.
 Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
 No.
  Im always this close.
 Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
  Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
 Cool.
 I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now  open your eyes.  Tadah!
 I bought it.  Its ours.  Lets go inside, Ill show you inside.   So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation.   Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.   This is the master bedroom but, Im actually not allowed in here so...
  So Im still in the process of converting the garage.  Its got great light in here and Im thinking, it could be perfect  for an art studio.   Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and its doesnt look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand its just---
 You do?
 Really?
 Oh my God...
 Yeah, I did.
 No, No, well just board that up.  Itll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
 Yeah, I cant... really cant move him.
 Uh, actually, Im gonna go with copier.
 Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I dont have to agree on everything.
 You have to make the decision.
 Hey.
 Mmhmm.
 Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
 Yeah.
 Beesly, are you threatening me?
 Okay.
  Whew.
 Woah, you guys going to lunch?
 Mind if I join?
 All right.
 Lets go.
 Lets do it.
 Where we going?
 Michael, that is hilarious.
 Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
 Yeah.
 You look really pretty.
  You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
 Yeah?
 There they are.
 You got it.
 Okay.
 Oh!
  We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... Ill double-check that for you.
 Let me call you right back. Okay.
 Wait, what?
 Truce?
 Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, Im going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.  Totally kidding.  Im gonna need four.
 Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
 Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
 I think itll take you a little longer than that.
 Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
 Thats the Christmas spirit.
 Yes.
 I will grant you one wish.
 Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.  Dumb.
 What is it?
 Wow, that is delicious.
 Cant believe no ones thought of that.
  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
 Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
 Thats cool.
 Well what if we cant do it quickly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but youre gonna need a permit for that.
 Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
  Theyve been in there for 45 minutes.
  Hey.
 Do you take requests?
 Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
 You did not know it.
 Everyone knew some of it.
 You knew it.
 She knew it.
 No, no, no, its not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
  No, no. Nope.
 Nothing.
 Why dont... Lets...
 How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
 Ahh!
 No, no.
 I know.
 Andy still doesnt know that Angelas having an affair with Dwight. And its been seventeen days. I mean, eventually hell figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now its just... awkward.
 We cant figure that out.
 No.
 Please stop.
 When?
 This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
 Stop. What?
 Okay, listen.
 This shouldnt happen at work.
 And!
 This shouldnt be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
 Well its not too late, because you havent done anything.
 But youre leaving...
  What are you standing for?
 Youre not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
 Dwight, Im in charge when Michaels gone, and I need you to sit...
 You okay, man?
 Hey guys, why dont we, uh, just cool off a bit?
 Nope.
 Okay, you know what? Thats enough. Because...
 Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
 So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
||
 Thanks Meredith.
 Dwight! Are your legs broken?
 Andy, are you all right?
 Looks like a red wire.
 Well its a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
 Doesnt it?
 Dwight, I am really busy, I cant talk about this anymore.
 I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal.  Oh hell be fine. I made it up there.
 Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
 Okay, okay, okay. Why dont we just put this to a vote, and then well be done with it.
  No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand.  Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand.
 Thank you, accounting department.
 I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people.
 Kevin, you know what, why dont you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you  and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot?  Does that end the debate?
  This close.
 OH!
  Im saying, all Im saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all Im saying.
 Back door.
 Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on.
 What?!
 No, no, no! Dont give him mouth to mouth for this!
  No. Michael. Michael.
  Michael! Michael!
 Hows that gonna help you?
 Right.
 And we dont know how.
 Punishment fits the crime.
  Whats going on?
 Uh, no one really knows, but Pams parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
 I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what theyre saying to everyone else, then--
 You couldnt of memorized that?
 Gimme a break.
  Can you believe this?  He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
 Hey.
 Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
 What?
 Mmm...
  Im ok, Im not, great, and um...
 Dont open your eyes.
 What?
 Oh my God. Pam, I dont know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, Im so sorry, I dont know. Ill call him again.
 Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
 Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
 Do ya?
 Ok. Remember Spider face?
 OK. Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
 Yeah... yep.
 Yep. Youre being replaced.
 He just sent a text...
 So what did he say? Was it my fault?
 You ok?
 Are you alright?
 This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
||
||
 Thats pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
 What the heck? Is that, uh...
 I didnt, Ill look somewhere else.
 All right.
  Hey, Kelly.
 Whoa! What was that all about.
  Go ahead.
 Okay.
 Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
  Just, easy.
 Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
 So this is fun.
 We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
  Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
 Okay.
  Are you kidding?
 Dwight. This,  fits in the palm of my hand. You havent blown em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
 What is that?  It is your birthday period.
 Not even an exclamation point?
 I cant believe how bad this looks.
 Okay, good then.
 I am working on it.
 Six dollars.
 I said I was working on it.
  How olds Kelly?
 Its Mose. Who do you think it is?
 Look, Im at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
 Do you think Im calling you for your best approximation?
  So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kellys party.
 Oh, great.
||
 Hey! What the hells goin on?
 What?
 Yep.
 Got it.
 Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
 Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
 And... ta da.
 How do you hate it? Its a cake.
 Right.
 I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still dont know.
 Birthday.
 Okay, you know what, next time, Ill let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
 Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
 Hey, whats that show that shes always talking about?
 You know what? I could use a little help.
 We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what youve been doing, is making a sign?
 Youve been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the partys now at 3!
 Im not writing, "Horse Hunt." I dont even know what that means.
  Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
 Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
 Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. Thats disgusting, and it doesnt count. So give me another one.
 Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
  Didnt see that one coming.
 Not a surprise.
 What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
 You havent heard our theme, though.
 Thats the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
 Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
 Yeah?
 No.
 All right.
 Ahem. This is for you... and  ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
 Thanks.
  Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
 Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we dont need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
 Jimbo!
   Ayyyy!
 Ayyyy!
 Youre only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
 Yeah.    Shes fine.
 Theyre for her to look at, Michael.
 Yes, lets have a word.
 Oh, Im sorry.
 I understand that.
 Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
 We do.
 That sounds fun.
 I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines arent gonna sweep themselves.
 Oh yeah, I understood.
 No way, a 280?
 Yikes.
 No.  Bob, no. No!
 That is a lie, that is a lie.
 But! That girl mustve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
 Nobody asked, Bob!
 I think if you ordered hot food youre allowed to eat.
 Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
 We should help him out.
 Here they come.
 No, just kidding.  Seriously though, thats enough.
 Oh great, I have to cover?
 Well they didnt dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
 We were.
  Empty.
 Oh boy.
 OK.
 So...
 Oh initially I did.
 Ding Dong.
 KGB.
 Ding dong.
 Ding dong.
 The KGB will wait for no one!
 We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
 Free paper.
 What are you doing?
  Why dont you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, youll know.
 What power?
 Well guys with girlfriends dont.
  Hey, Tom. Whats that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.  One of my clients found a golden ticket.   Yup. No, congratulations.
  Ill take that down right now.
 Im on the phone.
  Hold on one second.
  Its actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
  Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, whats that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesnt.
 How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
 OK...
 ...well Im going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didnt lose half my sales.
 So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so Im a little pissed too.
 Absolutely not, Im mad at you.
 Good one.
 All Im saying is that its a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
 No, that is what I mean.
 No, stop it.
 You cannot take the fall for him.
 He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
 There it is.
 You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, youve been talking about that movie for years.
 And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
 Yeah, lets face it. This meeting sounds like its Wonka fans only. Hes never seen the movie.
 Who is it?
 Alright. I just got out of the shower, Ill be one second.
 Yeah, Im late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, its a whole routine.
 If you want to come back then, thatll be fine.
 I get back from work around 6.
 You can try. That, that might work.
 Alright.
   I dont know. Is it classy enough?
  I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
  And of course, classy.
  Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that Im taking it very seriously.
  Thats it. Or Mr. Peanut.
  Oh, Dwight, youre trying too hard, and thats just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is its a state of mind.
  Ok, well lets just try this one on for size. And I apologize because its right off the top of my head  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
  Thats inspired.
  De classé.
  Hey.
  Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
  Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
  Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
  I didnt think youd notice.  Uh, its funny actually, theres another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
  Oh, youd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, theres probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
  Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it...
  I thought itd be funny.
  Thanks, Charles.
  No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
  You pet the animals and they pet you back.
  Hey.
  Alright, Charles, Ive gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, Im a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
  Second-in-command to Michael.
  Oh, thats because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
  Assistant regional manager, yeah.
   No, not exactly.
  Alright, I will, um, Im just gonna let you get back to that.
  Yep.
  See ya. See ya.  Bye!
  And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
   About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
  You called any headhunters?
  Right, cause thats what we are talking about.
   Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
  Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
  I would prefer not to.
  Youre starting your own paper company?
  Why?
  Do you know the industry is in decline?
  Right.
  No, I did that before, it added nothing.
  Okay.
  I am not gonna do this.
  And you are not going to, either.
  Heres the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because theyre set up to do that kind of thing.
  Hey.
  Nothing, just talking.
  I didnt... no.
  I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
  Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
  What?
  What? Pam!
  Pam! You cant be serious.
  Still no.
  Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
  Ill bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
  You gonna answer that, Kev?
 Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?  I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
 No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
 It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
 Here we go.
 Kev, cmon.
  Would you please stop that?
 Youre breathing very heavily.
 No its not.
 Oh no. I was just -
 ... Yes.
 Ive never been a kiss up. I - its just not how I operate. I mean, Ive always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
 Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
 Its cause Im more of a player.
 You bet.
 Well I do.
 I play.
 Well, maybe you should get back to work.
 Maybe we will someday.
 Yeah.
 Lets... eh... see ya.
 Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
 Oh, there he goes.
 Yikes.
 Aw, man.
 Oh! Goal!
 Aw, its gonna be the  worst.
 Left.
 Forward, definitely.
 Striker!
 Alright! Lets do it.
 Kickoff.  My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.  Alright!
 What?
 Okay, Im just gonna go get some ice.
 Im sorry, Phyllis.
 LOVE the hair.
 You realize youre not actually talking to me, right?
 The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. Its not the worse plan shes ever had.
 Hi!
 Sure!
 Okay.
 What the hells a rundown?
 When did you need that rundown by?
 Okay.
 Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. Im gonna dive in. To the rundown. Ill be exhausted cause its like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
 Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
 "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
 "This rundown better be really good"?
 Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
 No. I cant. It was like, hours ago.
 Oh, this is just something Im taking a break with.
 I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
 Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown youre looking for ?
 Keeping it simple -thats what Im doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
 No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
 No, I....
 Hey!
 Okay.
 Theres the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you werent prepared for.
 Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
 No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
 The one I have. Ill use the one I have.
 Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
 Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that cant be right.
 Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
 I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
 I think she just didnt want a crucifix cake.
 Am I going down a road?
 Its so scary how right the things youre saying are. And youre coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
 I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
 Hey, Andy. You know Ive been thinkin about what you said-
  -I just dont know if I can do it.
 Its just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. Im pretty emotionally needy.
  You know that I was doin this.
 Okay.
  I just totally blew a sales call.
 Yeah, well, with you its different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
 Why? When I look in the mirror, I dont like the face that looks back.
 Forget it.
 I said forget it.
 Oh, God.
 Hey.
 Okay.
 Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
 And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you dont think youre ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
 Oh, theyre my client.
 Hey, David.
||
 Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
 Really? Does he do good work or--
  Hey. I saw you called.
 Youre just out of business?
 Oh, yeah, well dont worry about it.  Well figure it out.  Well be okay.
 Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.   Oh, thats my new "Dwight" ring.
  Good, right?  Hello.
 Oh, okay.  Dont worry about it.
 Now, this is the projection over three months?
 Oh, but you didnt.
 Oh, I dont know. You know, theyve taken a good deal of clients, so--
 I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
 Okay, so Ill be back in, um-- back in a bit.
 Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
 Actually here for something else.
 You know I love a good guessing game, but why dont I just tell you what Im here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
 David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
 Oh!
 Oh!  See Im here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
  Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
 Missed the last part.
 Got it.
 Great work Dwight.
 No, I mean, great detective work.  Cause this must be the first case youve ever cracked, right?
 What are your top five cases?
  Because youve solved zero cases.
 Got it.
  Can you give us a hint?
 Can I address that?
  Okay.
 Of course.  What is like a hostage?
 Strongly-painted picture.
 Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
 Great.  See you upstairs.
 Hey, you have a second?
 Yeah, I think youre going to want to cool it with that cause its starting to upset the other salesmen.
  This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
 I know.  Yeah, its...kinda--
 Thats true.  Thats right.  Yeah.
 Well, what if I just do this?
 Im just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  Hes winning.  I feel like Im describing a dream I had.
  Oh, Im engaged to Pam.
  Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
 Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
 I dont want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
 Eh, shes nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
 Well, thats--
 Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
 He definitely stole my iPod.
  You didnt hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
 Mm-hmm.
 Thats not true.
  I think shed be a really good salesperson.
 And I wont.
  All right.  Youre right, sometimes when shes tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But thats not a weird voice.
  Take it easy.
 Not cool.
 There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
 So, it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
 Ok. So, were going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
 Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and thats great but then you have to invite -
 No one.
 Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."
 That makes sense.
  These are for you.
 You ready?
 We should probably stop by. Itd mean a lot to him.
 Were gonna stay.
 Yeah. At least for one more dance.
 Yes.
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 Yeah.
 Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so were all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 500 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
  Okay, Im gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
  Three, two, one...
  All right, you ready for this?
 Yeah.
 Wait, should I have left the car running?
 Come on, who doesnt like a picnic?
 I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
 Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
 Well...
 Hey, how are you?
 Yeah.
 I dont get it. Hes not even my boss anymore.
 No, I shouldnt have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
 Well, I couldve died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
 Nice job, Beesly.
 You all right?
 You sure?
 Hey, easy, easy...
 All right, you know what? Youre just trying to get rid of our best player.
 No, uh-
 All right, you know what?  Lets do this.
  Yeah, shes with the nurse right now, so youll have to stall a little longer... No, dont send in the subs yet... Dwight, I dont know. Think of something!
  Oh, Dwight, were so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so Ill call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.  Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs!  Ohh!
