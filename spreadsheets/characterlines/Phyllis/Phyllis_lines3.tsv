  Im getting married to Bob Vance.
  No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
  Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
 You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows youre worth it.
 Oh, yeah. Youll have to put out.
  Woooooow.
 Its really something.
 Youre kidding...
 Michael, what will you do?
 Maybe Ill quit.
 Thats a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
 Okay thats enough.
 Well, there is a ball.
 Im just saying hi to Bob.
 Whats on your suit?
 Ok, so, between Merediths Mini-van and if I borrow Bobs Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
 Isnt this fun? Not wearing shoes?
 Hey guys. Uh, Im trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, were never gonna see each other again.
 I thought maybe DJs.
 Okay, forget it.
 We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
 Stanley!
 Hey, I hear Jims coming back.
 I was...
  Ill tell you later.
 What smell?
 Oh, Ill help you find it.
 What is it?
 My perfume?
 Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. Its made from real pine.
 You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
 Oh, we find little times during the day.
 Bob Vance has an air pump. He said hed fill all our tires up.
 I cant feel my toes.
 I like goose. If its already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
 But we invited guests.
 I thought you said green was whorish.
 Itll be all right.
 You should, you should put out salt for the rims
 I was just getting a snack.
 OK.
 Hi.
 Oh, ok.
 Cold, huh?
 Maybe thatll help. Is it cold in there?
  Theres another party in the break room.
 Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
 I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
 Were the same age and Ill pick... Karen.
 Then how is this "Amazing Race"?
 Michael.
 Do you have a pole?
 Um-hmmm.
 Its a big order. Thanks Kenny.
 Hey, hows Annie?
 Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
 Im so glad youre with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
 You can pay me back later for the makeover.
 Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
 No. Sorry.
 Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
 Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
 Thanks, Michael. Thats sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
 Yes, very.
 No.
 That wasnt me.
 I thought it was...
 Michael... No.
 I dont need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
 I do.
 Thanks Angela.
 I dont have that, Dwight.
 Its beautiful. Why dont you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
 Its fish.
 You found Uncle Al!
 Thank you, Michael.
 Look, its got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
 Did you see...
 Mm-hmm, near the river.
 Four.
  I know, I know.  Were all trying to get to the bottom of this.
 I think I just got flashed.
 In the parking lot.
 Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
 I didnt really get a good look.
 Michael.
 When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
 Oh, it can be fun.
 She does have very nice clothes.
 No, the one before that.
 I bet you know. Dont think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
 My mom taught me that.
 Jims gonna love it.
 Is there any mustard?
 What are you gonna do?
 Dwight is our new boss.
 I think its gonna be Michael.
 No, but he wasnt qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
