 Helpless.
 Who was Pams first celebrity crush?
 You think that Andys family owned slaves?
 Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
 Whats going on?
  Oh my god!
 Oh, I know Id be more productive.
  Just drive away. Just..
 Role call.
 Dont you have any sunblock?
 No, hey, Dwight shouldnt...
 Dwight, you cant go. You have a problem with women. You cant sell to them.
 Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her â€˜gy-na for your entire meeting.
 Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
 Guys, we cant let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
 So, uh, show us how youd normally sell to a female client.
 Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
 No, she is the boss.
 No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
 Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. Its all garbage okay? Youre the woman, Im the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
 Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
 Oh, are those your kids? Theyre so cute! They could be models.
 Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. Its hopeless.
 Yeah.
 How much wine do you have?
 You know what? I dont know where the years went. Â â€˜Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I dont even recognize them.
 Whose hands are these?  Theyre not my hands. I dont know.
 No. Jim...
 No, theres wine in here.
  Can you help me?
  ha ha!
 Got it.
 Were gonna cover for you, ya know.
  Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
 Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
 I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didnt. Hmm, funny how that works.
 We already said no.
 Lets do it!
 Dwight said its "Hog maw."
 Its the lining of the stomach of--
 Come on, Dwight, youre making this up.
 Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
  Oh. What are these?
 Id rather have the bowl.
 What are you wearing?
 You got dumped?
 Whats gonna make you feel better, big guy?
 Mmm, this wont help him, its a muffin, not cake.
 Val.
 Well, we dont want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
 We think you made a big, big mistake.
 Hes a real catch and you should take him back.
 I have ears, Dwight.
 Clark!
 Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now thats Italian.
 What?
 Hey, wheres my ring?
 We dont work for you!
 Wait. This says â€œDunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledgeâ€?
 Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
 Well, Andys cute, but hes too vanilla, whereas Pete - hes just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
 David Wallace called this meeting?
 Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your  boyfriend. But, I mean, if you dont have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
 Oh...
  Ah, geez. My nails arent dry yet. I dont think I can work for at least a couple hours.
 Andy.
 He and Pam are having their Valentines Day lunch.
 We started selling balloons.
 I cant be around sad people, it makes me sad.
 Andy, dont. No good can come from snooping.
 Andy!
 What does that even mean?
 Put it down.
 Put it down
 See?
 Told you so.
 Come on Andy, theyre a good match.
 Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?
 It looks pretty black.
 Why are you here, Todd?
 I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so theyre dense. But, theyre also really fluffy.
 So, were all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
 OK. Packer can go to hell.
 I dont care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
 Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
 What did you do, Andy?
 Why?
 What the hell?!
 Wait, what?
 Play it again.
 Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didnt know it?
 I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
  What does it say?
 Ouch. Sorry, Andy, thats-.
 No, I think they mean more like a politician.
 Her hair looks beautiful.
 Yeah. Poor Angela.
 Andy sings beautifully. And hes really good at dancing. Hes a good speaker. But theres just something there you dont want to look at.
 Whats it now, dream or no dream?
 Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. Hes not terrible.
 No, hes good.
 Ill try this one.
  Hot!
 Were all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
 Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then hes gone for who knows how long.
 Which thing?
 Hit it, red!
 Yeah, Im not ready for this.
 Oh, some fudge?
 Thanks.
  Oh, you can afford it.
 After 16 years, its strange sitting across from somebody who isnt Stanley. Buthell get there.
 . Andy
 Andy, Ive been worried about you. How are you?
 Poor, poor Andy.
 Angelas special repairman is here.
 Its just the wind.
 Okay.  Its just the wind, see? Nothing.
 Let me help you us.
 Oh, Im gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
  I missed you.
 Lots of people think that Stanley Hudsons a mean old grump.  But  would a grump make this? Its me. Its me.
 Cool.
 Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
 Im happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
