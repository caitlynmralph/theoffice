  Angela, youll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure its the generic one. Its Stanleys favorite.
  Yes, Ive replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee.  I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
  Its going well.
  We lost weight today. I think its OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
  Stanley, Michaels not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
  You said fruit, Michael.
  Cake.
  Yes you were.
  Split the commission?
   Are you insane?!
  There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
  You left me in a bad part of town!
   Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
  Why should I have to thank him?
  I like her purple dress.
  I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
  I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
 Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
 I dont care what shes doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
 No.
 That cant be right.
 Hey, Im collecting for the baby shower.
 I know, Kevin.
 Look at it as if youre paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
 I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  Im no longer under Angelas heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
 Sorry.
  What are you making?
 Youre making a knife with a knife?
 You want to talk about it?
 You know I know.  You know they know.
 Hi.
 Its nice to learn new things.
 Okay.
 What dont you get?
 Angelas not really a risk taker. And Andys not really a risk.
 No, its lettuce.
 Where are we going?
 Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
 It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
 I think its a fun idea.
 We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
 Move on, Michael.
 Its the only gavel I could find.
 Oh dear.
 Why couldnt have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
 Now you move on.
 Well Dwight, I dont think you do. I think youve got your answer.
 Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
 I have my hug.
  Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
 Mm. I like your shoes.
 Sure.
 Im sitting right here Dwight.
 On more week.
 Dwight, stop it.
 Jim, dont listen to Andy.  I think its so romantic.
 Wheres your place?
 Ohhh...
 Hello.
 Know what?
  Im sorry.  Its the largest one I have.
 This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is "Nights in Morocco".  This isnt your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course shes from Morocco, in which case its very accurate.
 Yes.
 Angela. Youre going to move this for the party right? Its not on theme.
  Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
 I need you to get rid of the tree.
 Thank you.
 Oh, I dont think its blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I wont tell everyone that shes cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
 It looks like were going to be here for awhile, so why dont you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
  And napkins... fanned.
 I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate.  I dont think theyre appropriate anymore.
 Oh, sorry, its your job.
 You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why arent you wearing the hairnet?
 Ok... nice.
 Thats a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan.
 I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
 I didnt ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
 Excuse me?
 Okay.  Angelas having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Tobys going away party.
 Wow, thirteen!
 Why isnt Dwight turning around?
 Andys running over Dwight with his car.
 Dwight, get out of here!
 Youve got no taste Stanley Hudson.
 Hillary Swank.
 Shes not hot.
 What--
 Oh! I forgot my purse.
 What in the name of God is going on?!
 Thats not a good idea, Michael.
 He needs to rest.
 We bury him?
 It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
 Let me get you some water.
 Hey, this is your apology letter.
 I hope hes ok, I feel bad.
 Oh, ok.
 You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
 Shes out of your league Andy.
 Sexually?
 Theres always a theme.
 Hey, why dont you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  Well take all afternoon.  Michael is terrified of bob.
 It is so nice to go out with another couple.
 I know
 Hes talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
 Okay. Now everyone here whos bowled under 70 raise their hand.
 Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand.
 Yes I do.
  Bowling.
 Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Damn.
  Oh, thats the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
  Its just me here.
  I think he left.
 Um, lets see... its fine.
  Andy Hes gone.
  You dont have to kiss his ass anymore.
 I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
  No, I swallowed a crown.
 Its really cute.
 Whats wrong with you?
 I think you look nice.
 You sound worried.
 Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
 Mm-hmm.
 Maybe, and I dont know, if you had just returned Michaels call none of us wouldve lost clients.
 You mean the clients you stole from us.
 It sure looked good on the mannequin.
 Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
 Isnt that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didnt have enough time for them?
 Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
 You dont take my clients away and give them to a secretary.   No offense, Jim.  I think shes very pretty.
 Those sound too harsh.
 A restaurant.
 Ryan, hand the phone over.
 Me.
 Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
 Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
 Michael, just give us our clients back.  Thats all we care about.
 Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
 Work.
 Its a combo dance house coffee bar.
 Aw, what the hell?  Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
 Oh, Ill just duck my head in.
 Tell him Im going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Hi.
 Hey. I like.
 Oh! Mother ******!
 Back!
||
 Wow! Sorry!
 Its my back.
 Call a doctor.
 No. Call Bob.
 What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
 Dwight! Dwight!
 I do.
 That feels good, Dwight.
 An hour? I cant stay here an hour.
 But the rattlers so scary.
 I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
 When I say it out loud its so silly.
 Wanna dance, Dwight?
 Weve been out here for a while. I dont need this.
 Oh, Lord in heaven.
 Ow, my ankle!
 I... twisted it.
