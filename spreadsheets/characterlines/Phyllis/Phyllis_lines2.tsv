 What were you doing in the ladies room?!
 Why were you peering over the stalls?!
 You are a pervert!
 You, are, a pervert!
 But where would we...go?
 This says "Bushiest Beaver".
 Its, its fine.
 All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
 Im the same age as you, Michael.
 Were in the same High School class.
 Michael! Come on!
 You dont have to worry. Im not going to...
 ...report you to HR.
 Ill do it.
 Are you calling me a ho?
 Oh, you say that every time.
 Oh, boy...
 Um, The DaVinci Code.
 Definitely Jim.
 Come on, Pam.
 Yeah, I like Oscar.
 Thats great!
 What are you? A monk?
 Ass.
 Thats the characters name?
 Sir, you have some messages.
 Theyre important.
 First message is "I love you".  Thats from me.
 Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?  Pow.
 Sure.
 You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and youre talking all the time.  Im sorry!
  Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road Ive ever known...
 Dwight...
 Yes, I got those cute little ones.  Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
 Im sorry, everybody.
 I knitted it for you.
 Hi guys.
 Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
 Where are we going this afternoon?
 A furnace?
 What does the furnace do?
 Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
 Michael, you should stay home and rest.
 Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
 Oh, we wouldnt.  We love Stevie Wonder.
 Youre gonna compete against us?
 Im good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
 I dont know. I thought that I wasnt going to be asked that...
 Really? I thought they were pretty...
 ...and a big walk-in closet.
 Shes real good.
 Im excited about today.  I love girl talk.
 Mistake.
 That must have been hard.
 Mmmm, I think were all okay with the balance weve struck.
 Isnt he sweet?
 Really, Oh, theyre from Bob again.
 Goodnight Pam.
 Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
 Oh.
 Unbelievable.
 Its unbelievable!
 When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
 Where do we get those?
 Yes, its marijuana.
 Its labeled.
 We dont feel that way.
 Oh I got the Save The Date.
 Yeah, pretty stationery.
 Uh, on or off?
 Okay...
  Excuse me.
 No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
 Stanley and I are close, too.
 I know you keep saying its your space, even though theres no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
 I guess so...
  I dont like you.
 But I didnt report your snoring-
 Oh, dear.
 Afghani.
 Afghani.
 Okay, lets do it.
 Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesnt matter, its just fun to play.
 I have an ace.
 Oh, I have a flush!
 Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
