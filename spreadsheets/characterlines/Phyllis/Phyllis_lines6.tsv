 Theyre not getting married. Its just talk.
 Theres nothing to know, its just gossip.
 Teris out of town, Michael.
 Teri, Stanleys wife. Shes at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
 How far along is Pam?
 We have a right to know.
 Congratulations!
   Again with the cousin.
   Whats happening to you Michael?
 Whats going on?
 Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
 Perfect. I hate registries.
 My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldnt tell you, but youll still be suprised when you see it. Youre not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
 Good. Good.
 This isnt a game, you know? Its our livelihood!
 Not according to the beans.
 Its not so much that I might not get a raise. Its just demeaning!
 Yeah, I would, too.
 I say no.
 Michael!
 Come on! This isnt fair!
  Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
 Now this is getting ridiculous.
  Thats funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.
  I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldnt be a good wife.
 So he wont get caught!
  Disgusting...
  Good luck Michael, I hope you find what youre looking for.
 Wow. Sounds scary.
 Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
 And when you fell in, did you flounder?
 Michael, you make fun of us every day.
 So now youre comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
 Michael. You know, when you think about it, its not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
 Were not mocking, were watching.
 Well, well deal with it as it comes.
 Yes. Put the DVD in.
  This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
  Holy crap.
  "It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy."
  You know, I think Im supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?   I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
  What does that mean?
  Michael, I was doing so well.
  Well, I guess thats not-
 Lose the twirl.
 Yeah, good. Dont do it.
 Bob took me to Capellos. We got a little tipsy.
 Oh, its ok. Michael doesnt really care about these things.
 Its not like you can fire people or anything.
 Ryan.
 Sorry. Plastered.
 Whats "Scotts Tots?"
 Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
 Thats fair.
 How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
 Ooh.
 You didnt decorate it?
 Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! Its me, Santa Claus!
 Yeah!
 I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it.  Its been a long journey... but  Im Santa Claus!
 Its going to be a very jolly time if youve been good!
 Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
 Yeah.
 Well?
 The only Santa.
 You promised me this. Dont make me get Bob involved!
 Never mind, I shouldnt have said that.
 How do you know its a gun?
 In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, lets put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringles eye! Let the party begin!
 All right sweetie, Ill tell her its Michael.
 This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
 Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! Youve been very good this year -
 And this brings us to you, little one.
 Its a secret.
 Hi Michael.  Mm. kay.
 What?
 An Xbox it is. Because Ive decided youre a good boy.
 No Bob, we worked it out.
 Im sorry,
 Im really sorry. It was earlier today.
 Hi sweetie.
 Im good baby.
 Michael, this isnt a toast. Youre just thinking out loud.
 I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication Im on.
 No.
 I did.
 You dont even like us as friends?
  I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
  No, its 435.
  Good luck!
  This is ridiculous.  We just cant wait here.
  But you dont know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
  I have an ice cream cake in the car.
 Hey!
 But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
 Honey, if I dont have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely dont have time to walk over to your desk.
 Finally, Michael. Hand em over, numbnuts.  But seriously. Its your job to give us those leads.
 What are you -
 What the hell do you think youre doing?
 Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
 What are these for?
 Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
 I think youre remembering that wrong?
 I dont know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The companys changed, and if they dont like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
 Whats the least we can do to make this okay?
 I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
 Oh, if they dont have an iPod by now they really dont want one.
 Okay, fine. Cash it is.
 So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
 Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...
 Our treats, Stanley, theyve accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
 Yuck. Im not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Ten...
Eleven, wow!
One more, one more!
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV Id like to try. Ill ask Bob.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats em up. What?
Hey, you two having fun?
 I dont get it.
 You dont know that. Some people cant help oozing sexuality.
 She just crossed her arms together... thats bad.
 Michael, you know, its easy to get fooled. Bobs warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... its mostly harmless. Usually I dont let it go too far.
 Oh, Michael.
  I dont think hed do that.
  Oh Michael.
  Hey!
  Was there a fistfight?
  And it didnt change your mind.
  Michael, thats awful.
  Yes.
  For your signature.
 Awww, its kissing its mommy!
  Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
 Look, hes been complaining about this for a while, its not crazy.
 I dont know, is it Shadow or Garth, its something weird, I...
  You deserve it.
