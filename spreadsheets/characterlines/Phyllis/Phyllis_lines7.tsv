 Luke? Luke!
 Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didnt get em.
 Yeah, but its like youre saying we should bother Luke.
 Hey, why cant we bother Luke? He deserves it.
 Well, take a look. Its all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
 Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
  The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
  Im glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and hes stupid.
  Go get em Dwight.
 Its nice, like Up.
 Found him!
 Your show was really great, Andy.
 Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
 Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
  God! Wow!
 Thats no pimple Michael.
 Oh! When you got your new phone, thats when you asked for everyones attention.
 The ability to express love physically. Its a magical thing.
 What? Is Dan okay?
 Yes.
 Oh, thats great news for your friend.
 You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
 I could try to seduce him.
 Uh...
 This is weird.
 Its not gonna get better; hes gonna steal all of our clients.
 I dont know, theyre both handsome.
 I think he-
 Oh.
 What should we ask?
 An asset!
  Who takes a kid to Mexico?
 Church isnt a party, Michael.
 Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
 Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
 Heres her carrier, but no Cece.
  Whos that?
 Whos that?
 Which ones Glee?
 You know your perfumes!
 Are you alright?
 I know. I thought you two were nice together.
 Made love? I dont know.
 Ill see what I can find out.
 Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
 And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
 Of course you dont wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didnt even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
 Magical...
 You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
 What do we do? How do we stop this?
 Yeah, Dwights right we should drop a bomb.
 Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
 I am jumping.
 Yes, Im jumping.
 Yeah, I dont even have a laptop.
 Oh God.
 Oh, dont be such a baby.
 Whats the case, Toby?
 So is it an open relationship?
 Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
 So you went homemade this year.
 Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I dont think we can help you out.
 Are you good at homemade?
 Yeah...
 Well, I dont think Erin seems to like you.
 I think its good.
 I know Sue. Shes not that great. And you know her husbands in a wheelchair, right?
 Ill talk to her, Michael.
 Why wouldnt she?
  Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
 Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
 No.
 So, Ive just gotta know. Whats going on with you and AJ?
 You didnt break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
 A lot of mines in Scranton.
 Im out too.
 Hmm?
 Wow.
 C.C
  Im clicking!
 I am clicking.
 Well, if you think its so easy, Gabe, why dont you try it?
 Yes.
 Yeah, who wrote it?
 Maybe thats not the best one. Keep reading.
 No, thats not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
 Yeah, there you go.
 Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they wont do it, but they will if you make a scene.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, and its not just the kissing. Its the flirtatious whispering.
 If youre just handing them out, I want one too.
 Yeah mostly.
 It didnt go down so easy but shes made some friends and its already better than it was.
 Uh I dont know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says I cant take care of myself anymore its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if youre interested.
 Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
 Mmm, whatcha got?
 I love their breadsticks!
 I have diabetes too. You dont see me making a big deal about it.
  How about cupcakes?
 The three of us have all been chairmen before.
 Yeah that was a surprise...
 Please Michael.
 I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
  Look Michael, its a going away present so your hands wont get cold.
 Its almost done, but you cant get them wet, and they cant be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
 Its cute.
 What does that even mean?
  Do you believe that?!
 Hmm, lets hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.
 As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
 Yeah, cupcakes. Thats what I said.
  You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
 No.  Im on a sale!
 Okay...
 Theyre almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
 Oh no, theyre still not done.
  Here.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Im not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women arent.
 Thats true.
 He means the ice pack.
 You could put your cell phone in it instead.
 Hows your hearing?
 Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
   Good morning.
  Did you have a nice drive in?
  Oh, Im sure theyll let us know when they get the results.
  It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
  But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porkys had come out.
  Mm.
 Yeah.
  Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
  Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
  Bestiality. Yeah.
  If my daughter were asking me...
  I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
  I dont think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
  You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
  Is it true that youre making Dwight the manager?
  He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
  Yeah.  Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point.
  No, were not related. I got the call. But... Ill tell her some other day.
  It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
  Then what was this all about?
