 You guys are together?
 Did you plan it?
 Michael...
 Sorry, I didnt know you guys were in here.
 I couldnt see your hands.  Hey Pam, by the way, its great that youre dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You cant base who gets new clients on who youre sleeping with that week, OK?
 OK.
 Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
 Did you even try?
 I cant see half of the things.
 Michael.
 This is stupid.

 Okay.
 Bye everyone.
  Well, I got in line to buy Sue Graftons book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasnt supposed to take no for an answer.
 So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
  No.
