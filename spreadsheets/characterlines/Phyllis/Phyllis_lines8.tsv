 Whew, well. I guess thats that.
 Good night, Andy.
 Ill start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
 Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
 Andy, dont make us sell this stupid thing.

 Just wear one of your bowties.
 Thats still a lot of money!
 Yeah.
 What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
 Andy, this is a seriously big order. I cant lose this client.
 No..we dont
 Yeah, I lost my client.
 The first thing Id buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- Its embarrassing.
 Yeah, whats the reason?
 Yeah, its just a picnic.
 Why didnt you just say this was to impress Robert California?
 Who?
 Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
 Wait, they have food there?

 Well, this could be fun. I-
 Im in too.
 Ooh. Isnt that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
 Yeah, sign says "Begin tour here."
  I dont think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
 Oh, I like Olive Garden.
 Open the door, Jim.
 Are you sure? Yeah, its locked.
 Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
 I dont get it.
 We have a gym at home. Its called the bedroom.

 You know, dont listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
 Is that Cici?
 Thats awful.
 Dwight?
 He should pay.
 What?
 Backups.
 Oh I know you think that, because thats where the Olympics were held.
 Well, I know Elizabeth Taylors sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
 Oh, I dont think youre being silly.
  Then another woman will get it. We cant allow that. We have to destroy it.
 Roberts house is, well....I dont mean to sound offensive, but its like where a basketball player would live.
 How was jury duty?
 Did you send him to the slammer?
 Oh, Id love to but, um-
 Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
 Yeah.
 Why?
  Im sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
 Cookies?
 Oh.
 No, just go home.
 Just go.
 Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
 Are you glad to be back?
 I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
 Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
 If I wanted Jamaican food Id just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
 Ooh, gosh, the moon ones damning. Yeah, sorry.
 No way.
 Do you have a black eye?
 Look, I dont feel safe. I think we should call the police.
 If Dwights not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
  Yeah.
 Oh.
 Make them kiss each other.
  What are you doing?
  Hey! Good to have you back.
 Yeah.
 Nellie, Im sorry, but I dont feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I dont know.
 Pam.
 Really?
 Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
 Oh, I dont know. Now I think he doesnt.
 He does have a moustache.
 I cant believe hes making us throw a party for her.
 It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
 On purpose.
 Order carrot cake.
 Toots, were not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
 Welcome to your party.
 Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
 Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
 Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
 Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
 I actually sleep better when its raining.
 What do you mean?
 Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
 I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybodys being so nice to me today.  Im really happy being here.
 If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted til I was forty-four.
 Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.
 How do you? I mean, why do you think hes there?
 Yeah, the Syracuse branch cant be happy youre taking New York clients.
 Whats he doing?
 Oh.
  Yeah.
 Is it true youre buying the company?
 So were not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
