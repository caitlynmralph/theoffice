 Oh, I told you. I couldnt close it. So...
 Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
 My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... Im boring myself just talking about this.
 Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
 Nothing.
 All right. Take care.
 Yes?
 Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
 Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 Its not on your desk.
 Why not?
  Well see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesnt bother me.
 If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pams favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
  How do you know it was me?
 OK. Dwight, Im sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
 Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
 Thats why were all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
 Tonight, hopefully.
 Whats going on?
 You know what? You should come with us. Because you know were all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Um... Whats in the bag?
 No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
 Do I think Ill be invited to the wedding?
 Hey.
 How are things?
 Oh no, I just decided not to. Hows your headache?
 Good. Good.
 Thats great
 Yeah?
 Am I walking out?
 Yes, I... Do you want to...
 Great. Let me just...
  Oh, Roy.
 Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here.
 Thats the thing. Its very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? Im sorry, Mr. Decker. I think Im losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I dont know. Hold on one second.
 Do you really have to do that right now?
 Mr. Decker, Im sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? Thats it. Perfect. So what I was saying...  Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
 That is not the expression.
 This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. Im not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year Im pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. Im getting cocky. Right?
 Solitaire?
 Six on seven.
 So then, why didnt you do it?
 Who doesnt love that?
 Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
 You know what? Im actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
 Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
  Uh, is that it?
 Hello? Hello?
 What are you watching?
 Really?
 No way. I think she likes this stuff.
 Yeah, you know, shes engaged, but...
 Oh, yeah. Shes hot.
  Mr. Decker, we didnt lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... whats that? No, we didnt close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. Thats actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I dont blame you.
  Um... Hey.
 Hey.
 We can go.
 Thats fine.
 Uh... Not a bad day.
 Last night on Trading Spouses, theres... have you seen it?
 Interesting, whats that like?
 Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
 Gosh.
 That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
 Yeah. I just dont think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
 Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
 Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, Id have to throw myself in front of a train.
 It says "workspace".
 If its the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
 You are not my superior.
 I thought it was a workspace?
 You cut more than you had to, didnt you?
 Well, why did you do that? You work here, dont you want good insurance?
 OK, well, if youve never been sick, then you dont have any antibodies.
 OK, you know what Dwight? We cant write our diseases down for you because thats confidential.
 Workspace.
 Wait. What are you writing? Dont write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cause Im suffering from both.
 Oh, great.
 I thought you said you were inventing diseases? Thats spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
 Thank you.
 What are you talking about?
 OK, whoa. Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that theyre fake?
 Absolutely not.
 No I didnt.
 Killer nanorobots?
 Sounds tough.
 Do you?
 Mmm hmm.
 Yep.
 Good luck.
  Jim Halpert.
 Who is this?
 No, you cant fire me.
 OK, can you hold on? Im getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert.
 Hey Pam! How are you?
 Im doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
 No, not at all.
 I have nothing to do.
 Oh yeah?
 The mall?
 Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
 Absolutely, I do.
 At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
 To what?
 And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, heres a way."
 Oh yeah.
 I think it has something to do with Survivor, but Im not sure.
 Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
 What? No.
 What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. Im using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
 Well Im trying to. Do you see what Im doing?
 But listen, Im going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
 All right.
 Yeah, what do you think thats about?
 Im on it.
 You are not going to believe this.
 Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
 Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
 Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
 Toby and Kevin, theyre trying to get Angela kicked off.
 Well, I dont know, if Kevins in accounting, and Tobys in Human Resources and theyre talking...
 I love their sandwiches too.
 Their bread is very good.
 OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
 Because were strong, Dwight. Because were strong.
 Sure, whats up?
 Oh no?
 No, will not, Im not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
 That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
 OK, heres the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Merediths birthday.
 I know, but its gonna be a little tough because theres no good place to hide there.
 What? What?
  Great.
 Good.
 Wait, this isnt gonna work. The lids open.
 I cant do that. You wont be able to breathe.
 Thank you, thank you. OK.
 So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
 Right... Thats good.
 Pam, hes in a box. Hes downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. Im serious. Go down there and work your magic.
 Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscars charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
 Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. Its gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I cant even calculate what youre gonna have to give.
 OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
 OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
 But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
 If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
 No, no, dude, no.
 No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
 God, I dont even, I dont even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... weve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
 Its stupid. Its, its just office pranks.
 God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power Ive ever seen go to someones head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
 Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
 Thats him.
 Uh, I heard it.
 Ill do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
 Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And Im, yeah, Im looking forward to playing. You know, I think Im gonna impress a few people in here.
 You coming down?
 You gonna wish me luck?
 Whoa.
 Is that trash talk from Pam?
 Oh.
 Well, Im going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because Im also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
 I think Ill see you at the mall. Yeah.
 Have a good game man.
 Really? I thought Id take Roy.
 My bad.
 You know what? Let me take Roy.
 Take it easy.
  ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
 I didnt sign anything.
 Cute, sure, yeah.
 Shes not really my type.
 Hmmm, I dont think so. Nope.
  Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
 Too late, Kev.
 Pam and I are good buddies.  Im sort of Pams go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
 Shed be perfect for you.
 So, what? Youre Assistant Regional Manager.
 Well, you know what Dwight? Hes your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
 Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, Youre both um, salesmen. I mean thats something right there.
 Its all gold.
 Alright. Heres the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
 You buy a purse.
 Dwight, thats not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
 Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
 Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
 No. You dont need the bathroom. Youve got it. Go.
 Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever youre doing because this is going to be good.
  Hi my names Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
 Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
 Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
 Im going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
  Here he comes, shhh...
  Good.
| He did pick a good one. 	|
 A futon?
 Hes a grown man
 Thats sad. Or its innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one.
 Hi.
 Im Jim, by the way.
 Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
 I do. Thats what Im best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, lets talk about purses.
 Katy but you know what, dont try to sell me one. Okay, seriously cause Im just here to learn.
 Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
 Whats up?
 Thank you for choosing me.
 Ah, well I think Im gonna see Katy.

 Have a good night.
 Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so its lighter.
 Alright now, Im gonna warn you. Dont freak out, okay?
 This is a really nice car. In case you havent noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
 Youre not going to freak out?
 So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
 What?
 Oh, I cant because I keep them hidden. I dont want to look at them and get cocky.
 No, its hilarious, youre right. I just think, um, "worlds longest engagement", um, were all expecting it, you know?
 Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
 Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
 Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
 Oh!
 Oh.
 Yeah.
  I think those might be empty.
 Second drink?
  Yeah, alright Kev.
 Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
 What a great year for the Dundies.
 We got to see Ping.   And we learned of Michaels true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life.
 What?
 Okay.
 I dont know, what?
 Oh my God! You are so drunk!
 Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
 Hes a volunteer.
 Dwight come on, come-
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Whoa, careful, careful.
 No you dont.
 Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
 Shoot.
 Not really a question.  Okay, lets get you home, youre drunk.
 Alright.
 Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
 Hey.
 Um... I dont think so.
 Oh! There it is!
 Um... Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.
 Well done.
 Topical.
 Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!
 Except pass that breathalyzer.
 Im really excited to meet your Mom.
 Oh yeah?
 Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
 Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
 Im in an office relationship. Its special. Um... shes nice. Shes shy. Shes actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that youd be on camera. Im sorry, shes European. No, I told you that youd be on camera. Stop it.
 No, thanks. Im good.
 Does that include Thats What She Said?
 Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
||
 Mm-hmm.
 No way. Lets do this  Oh.
 Wind.
 Perfect.
 Oh.
  Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
   What does 2005 season mean?
  Wait a minute, what is this?
  What?
  Really?
  Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
   OH!
  Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
  Why?
  Hey, do you guys have any other games?
  So thats what this sound is all day.
 Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
 Fair enough.
   This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the mens bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
  Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
 Let the games begin.
  You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And Im blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
  Hum.
  Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
  So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
  Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.
 Here we go.  Here we go.
  Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! Its Phyllis!
  Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
  Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
  Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
  Very nicely done. I think thats H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
  Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
  Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
  Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal.
  What?  Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
  Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!
  Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 115.
 Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys?
  Nothing. Guys? Timers still going? Er?
   Here you go. All done.
  Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
  Hey.
  Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
  Okay, today. 5 oclock. Closing Ceremonies.
  Notify the athletes.
  Michael.
  Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
  Nice.
  Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
  These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. Youre on the top one.   Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.
  And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
  Um... Cause your condos in America.
  Those are the doves.
 Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
 So were still on for lunch? Youre meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
 Okay.
 Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So were going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
 And, um...
 Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
 Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
 Nice. Third book?
 Okay. Phyllis.
 Nice.
 I guess.
 Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
 Nice. Smart.
 Okay. Thought people read more books.
 DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
 Wow.
 Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
 Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies youre going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
 Unforgivable.
 Good.
 Pam? Get us back into it.
 Five movies. Go ahead.
 Ooh, definitely in my top five.
 What?
 Okay thats five.
 Pam, play by the rules.
 Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
 All right. Lets move on. Lets move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
 Um, not neccessari...
 Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe Ill... Ill finish explaining the rules. Lets... let me explain it first, and then...
 Yeah, so well get right... You know what? Ill be right back. Stanley, youre taking over for me, buddy. Ill be right back.
 Dwight. Dwight.
 Come on Dwight! Use words.
 Who goes to business school?
 He does?
 What?
 You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
 Yeah. Youre right.
 Alright buddy.
 Nothing.
 Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. Hes really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
  Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. Were just here, were playing Desert Island. Its when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
 Hey.
 Good, how are you?
 Good to see you, too.
 Yeah, I am too.
 What answers?
 Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
 Okay, I think the games over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
 Yeah?
 Sure.
 Im a three hole punch version of Jim. Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
 Oh, yeah.
 Okay, okay...
 Nice.
 Okay, okay. Um, how bout, the ultimate team player?
 Dwight is... special. But, I dont believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craigs List. Were really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
 Um. He sticks to his guns.
 Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? Im gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
 Um... its in Maryland.
  Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.
 Honestly, I dont think Michael has the slightest clue of who hes gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, whats going to happen is its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
 Um... yes.
 Michael, I really didnt mean to...
 Im sorry?
 Oh, you want me to be you?
 Okay.
 Oh, are you firing Creed?
 We should switch seats in order to...
 Alright.  Excuse me. Im really sorry, but I have to let you go. And its purely budgetary. Its not personal...
 Wow.
 Thats an overreaction.
 Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
 Okay.
 Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
  Michael Scott here.
 Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
 It wasnt me.
 Yeah, I know.
  Come on.
 Thats just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that were friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if Im gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldnt blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because its double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
 That is weird.
 Ok, well, youre the one who lost the desk.
 Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
 I think you should retrace your steps.
 Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
  Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
 I know.
 Uh, yeah, ream.
 Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
  Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
 Umm...
 You know what, let me give you a call right back. Im going to uh, find it and then Ill call you back, thanks.
 Was that your mom?
 Oh, I thought it was your mom.
 Assistant to the Sensei, thats pretty cool.
 Ok.
 Uh, Larissa Halpert.
 117 Mount Bergin St.
 You making this up as you go along, arent you?
 Well, at least I dont have cavities.
 Thanks.
 Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
 No Im not.
 Oh, thats not advice. What advice sounds like is this umm, dont ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.
 Ok, say please.
 Please?
 Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
 Ok, Roy?
 Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
 Well, Dwights a purple belt, so...
 Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
 Sounds tough. When youre a Jet,  youre a Jet all the way, right?
 I cant. I just got a manicure.
 Just have Dwight punch you.
 You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
 Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
 Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
 Ok, Ill buy you a bag of chips.
 Obviously.
 Yes.
 Uh, Kitchen.
 Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwights dojo?
 Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, Im coming, fight...
  Wow, that is really interesting.
 Your love line- Im just kidding. I cant see anything.
  Oh, ok.
  Tied up.
 What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
 Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend.
 No.  Theyre in the conference room.
 So this possible client theyre talking about, actually a big deal.  Its Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.   Years.
 No...
 We are doing worst first dates.
 Wait, when was this?
 I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
 Is this real?
 Agent Michael Scarn.
 How long is this?   Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
 Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didnt really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
 Do we all have our copy of "Threat Level Midnight", by Michael Scott?
 Alright, lets get this started.  Im gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
 Oh yeah-
 Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
 Dwight-
 Do you want to play-
 The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
  Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
 Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
 A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn.  Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
 Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
 Thats actually a good idea.  Well all take a brief intermission.   Hey, are you hungry?
 Yeah?
 I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. Im not a complainer.
  Wow.
 Nice.  Thats excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
 So, I guess Ill see you in  ten hours.
 Travel.  Ive been looking forward to it.  Its gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
 Yeah.  Definitely.
 Jan didnt come back for her car last night.
 Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
 No way.
 Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
 Really.
 Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
 Dinner and a show, if you include Michaels movie.   And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
 Youre right, we didnt dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
 Least I didnt leave you at a high school hockey game.
 Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
 Ok, we didnt dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, its not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
 No.  Thank you.
 Done.
 Sok.
 Youre not having sex.
 Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
 Wow.  Um, ok.
 Ok.
 We dont have double-tabbed manila file folders.
 No, we dont.
 Alright... well, Im not asking for a raise. Im gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
 I win.
 Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
 Duh.
 Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that its Friday.  And thats what Ill be working on this afternoon.
 Ohh...
 Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks its Friday.  So, keep that goin.
  Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 1115, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
  ...Saturday, so just let me know what youre doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
 Hey, hows it goin?
 Course, its on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
 No, that was unbelievable.
 I dont really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
 Um, you dont, I dont think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
 Oh-
 Yeah, no, I dont think you can.
 Ummm... no idea.
 Are we in danger?
 What?
 Hmm...
 No.
||
 Uh hum.
 Its true. Im having a party.  Ive got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didnt invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And its nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldnt be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because Im pretty sure he thinks that Im making Dwight up.    He is very real.
 Oh, uh, no. Could-
 Could, keep that down.
 Because not everybody knows about the party.
 Umm, Michael.
 Because its a surprise.
 Uh hmm.
 So, dont tell.
 Ok.
 So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
 I know.
  Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roys gonna come, or...
 Oh, ok, cool.
 Hey.
 Yup, its, uh, four oclock.
 Oh, um... .I cant.
 Uh hmm, definitely.
 You do?
 Because you said "do you wanna hang out"-
 Really?
 Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
 Improv sounds great.
 Alright.
 I think Stanley just coughed.
 Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybodys attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, its not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
 Thats because Marks my roommate.
 Uh hmm.
 Oh, uh, later-ish.
 Great.   Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
 Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
 Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if were lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
 Uh, actually, I havent talked to her in a while.
 We can talk about that later.
 See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  Its-
 This is my desk.
 My home office, this is it.
 Ok, sure. Will do.
 Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
 You know what?  Lets just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
 Yeah, you dont have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, thats not gonna be awkward at all.
 Oh yeah.
 Thank you.
 Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin fun?
 Chicken, hot dog, burger.
 There is soda inside.
 Oh by the way hows your side project going?
 Really?
 So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But Im also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I wont. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
 I think I did a pretty good job.
 Well, I cant tell you cause its a secret.
 Yeah?
 Well, theres a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
 Thats great. Well dont tell me who it is, cause I can ..
 Oh, cool.
 Great. Where did you get it?
 He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag.
 Theres a little more to it.
 What is Yankee Swap?
 I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
 Oh, shouldnt we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
 Sure you dont want the teapot?
 Right.
 No. No. Definitely. Its ..
 Got to be kidding me.
 Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
 I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
 Come on, its a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
 To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, its a little too much to handle.
 You know, you dont have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
 But ..
 Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
 I didnt think you were going to get that one. I really didnt.
 Hey.
 Whats up, buddy?
 Wow, thats weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, thats pretty good.
 Who, Steve?
 Oh, there it is. J1.
 Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
 "Its time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."
 So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
 Yeesh, how old is this ship?
 Im not really sure what movie youre talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
 Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that hes king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
 Its not hilarious, but...
 Um, no.
 Yeah.  Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
 Well...
 Oh, um...
 Um... lets see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
 You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
 No.
 I dont know. Lets break up.
 What happened to you?
 Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
 What a night.
 She was always engaged.
 Thats... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
 Yeah, I know.
 Yeah. Shes really funny, and shes warm. And shes just... well, anyway.
 Shes engaged.
 Huh.
  Yeah, thats right.
 What?
 Whats going on?
 Im sorry? Pam.
 What is going on?
 Hey, whoa, Michael...
 Its, okay, its Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
 You burned
 Oh...
 But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
  What was that...
 Oh!
 He hit the pole!
 Its broken right, he cant...
 Oh Dwight, Dwight,   Ohhhhhh!
 Hes still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
 So, where are you shipping your foot?
 So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
 Do you think Dwights bein a little weird today?
 And that isnt weird?
 Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
 I want to clamp Michaels face in a George Foreman grill.
 You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
 Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because Im pretty sure he has a concussion.
 Fine.
 Slowly, slowly.  Lets just get to the elevator.
 What are you doing?  What, stop...
  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
 You cant lay down.
 Wake up.
 Im just gonna get...
 Just keep him awake.
 You dont think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
 Well, I think she has a kid.
 Come on, get inside.
 Were going to Chuck E. Cheese.
 Were going to the hospital, Michael.
 Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
 Give the bottle to Michael
 Give the bottle to Michael!
  Will you stop?
 Michael stop.
 Michael stop.
 Stop
 Its Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
 Concussion.  What did you write?
 So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
 Come on Dwight.
 Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
 Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
 Michael went in there with him too.  Its pretty sweet.
 Uh huh.
 But they shouldnt be much longer now, so well be back soon.
 Ok.
 Bye.
 Not much whats up with you?
 Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
 Nothin much whats up with you?
  So close.
 Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the worlds worst confidant.
 Hey Michael.
 Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
 Umm, hmm.
 Nobody.
 Alright. Great. Thank you.
 Im going with grape.
 Which one?
 I dont know what you mean.
 Uh, uh, ok.
 Im going to take off actually.
 Tony the tiger.  You dont hear that much any more.
 Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
 Thanks.
 I dont know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
 No, thats alright, thank you though. Its, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
 Oh, ah, no but no. You know what lets go out. That was a good idea.  Lets go out.
 Nope were not brothers.
 Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
 Uh, I really dont want to talk about it.
 Um, shes easy to talk to I guess and shes got a really good sense of humor.
 Uh-huh.
 What about you?
 Wow, thats not what I meant.
 Thank you.
 Thanks, thanks Dana.
  Just you know politics, literature.
 Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I  dont. Riveting.
 Hey.
 Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
 It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
 Big day.
 Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. Its so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
 Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
 And seriously, its totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
 Oh you did?
 No, no, you saw through me, great.
 Oh yeah, yeah... hope thats okay.
 And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
 Ok.
 Hey.
 Umm, what happened?
 Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man its, you know what. Its not a big deal.
 Look its one day, everythings gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
 Good.
 Ready?
 Oh, nothing.
 Pams on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so itll be nice to see her.  Itll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, thatll be nice.  And thats that.
 Oh, nothing.
 Hey!  Welcome back!
 So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
 Good!  Whats goin on here?
 What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
  Oh.  Wow.
 That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
 But theres definitely a desk open in the back.
 ...which I guess Ill be taking.
 No, no, no, seriously, Ill be in the back.
 Hey, Kelly.
 Um, just for the day while Michaels at my desk.
 Allergy to... the desk?
 Its the lever on the side.
 No, I dont think I can...
 Hey!
 Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  Its actually little awkward.
 What do you think of Kelly?
 Are you interested in her?
 Really?
 She said lots of things.
 I have no idea.
 Yeah.  Sure.
  Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  Ill talk to you later. Bye.
 Yep.
 What is?
 Thanks for the heads up, Kev.
 Oh, no, no. No.
 Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
 Yeah. I like talking to her too.
 Yes. Yeah.
 Yep. Cool, man.
 Ponies.
 Flowers.
 Hey!
 Its a complete... well, actually its exactly what youd expect, so... How are the girls?
 Did you really?
 Oh.
 Good.
 Nice. Well, whats it all about?
 I think you should do it. Thats great!
 So youre not doing it.
 Why not?
 Come on.
 Roy said that.
 You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
 You are?
 So I broke up with Katy and havent been dating anybody else, so this year I dont have to worry about Valentines Day. Its gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. Were gonna play some cards and Ill end up winning a lotta money. Because, theyre idiots. Its gonna be great.
 I dunno, its on
 It was there when I sat down.
 Hey Kelly. Whats up?
 OH, thats great. Im really happy for
 Wow.
 Wow.
 No, dont be.
 I bet.
 Alright.
  Nah thats alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. Thats fine. No, I didnt even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
 Take it slow. Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...
  Oh, no, not while Im here.
 You know what? Heres the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? Itd be great, but he isnt.
 Well, hes not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
 Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentines Day.
 Can we not?
 Still want that.
 Cuginos pizza.
 Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
 What did I do to deserve this?
 No.
 Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
 Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
 Im going to take a trip. Im going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
 Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
 Can I go?
 So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where Im going yet. Its kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
 What is that?
 I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
 When did you go there?
 Really for like how long?
 Where do I want to go?
 No. Were not.
 Which means absolutely nothing.
 Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
 Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
 You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
 Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that youve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
 The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
 Youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists. Many times. Its supposed to emphasize your point.
 Ok, I didnt actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
 Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
 Maybe. Thanks.
 Yeah. Im definitely going.
 Im going. Im a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
 I dont know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
 Im... leaving on June 8th.
 Yeah. And Im really sorry about that, I just...
 Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
 Alright.
 Bribery. Nice.
 The ocean.
 What are you reading?
 Aww, best book?
 Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
 Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You dont want to help me with some of my sales, do you? Cause, Im kind of swamped.
 Really?
 Yesss. And youre Abby, right?
 Im Jim.  Annnnd... lets sell some paper.
 Lets start with... your mom.
  Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
 Really? Cause shes pretty strong, Dwight.
 Thats pretty funny.
 Cant believe his mom dressed him like that, thats the real tragedy.
 Ohh, man, I would love to! I cant tonight, but can I come over some other time?
 Thanks, Kev. Uhm... Im actually going on a date.
 Why does he own a guitar if he doesnt know how to play?
 No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
 Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
 Man, Im so sorry. When do you find out?
 Oh, okay.
 Kelly, you know what...
 Sometime today.
 Maybe, but... were gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
 So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&Ms, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he wont get that back.
 Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
  ...What?
 Yeah, you dont?
 ...Okay.
 Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
 Just... quit stalling.
 Such a dork.
 How old are you?
 Well thats an invasion of privacy, so, Im going to tell Michael.
 You... owe me.
 Think you can let go?
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
 Is that Michael?
 ...Its something to think about.
 You look cute today, Dwight.
 So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
  I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
 Whoa. You are a volunteer.
 And thats not the same.
  Volunteer duty.
 Well, your office is behind you.
 Im just saying that you cant be sure that is wasnt you.
 Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just dont remember.
 Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
 Now how do you know how it works?
 No! You said that Id be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
 Oh, um... Why do you keep CCing me on things that have nothing to do with me?
 Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
 Oh...
  Cmon!
||
 Hi.
 How much time do you have left on your break?
 Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just dont get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
 Yeah, I mean its inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but Im fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
 Dwight tried to kiss me.
 And I didnt tell anyone because Im not really sure how I feel about it.
 Well, Im not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
 Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe shes just trying to be friends.
  Well, what does Roy think about everything?
 You mean your thoughts and feelings?
 Yeah...
 Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
 Well, it saves time, you know. Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
 This came out really well.  There you go.
 Oh.
 What did I write?
  Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
 That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took em all out.
 Just a simple macro. You know, these actually dont sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
 Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And thats how I spent my entire day that day.
 Maybe Stanford would be cool.
 Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
 Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
 No, Pam.
 Pam, it wasnt her.
 Im the one who complained about you.
 I... I didnt know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
 You know, it was one day.
 And I took it right back. It was like...
  Hey, Pam... its Jim. Um, I have a doctors appointment in the city. So I probably wont be in till the late afternoon. Just thought Id let you know. Okay, bye.
 Oh, thanks.
 Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
 I can always kind of win at roulette.
 Yeah.
 Mind control.
 Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
 It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
 Okay, Ill try.
 That doesnt exist anymore.
 I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
 Guys, the Afghanistananies.
 What are you doing?
 "Till Death Do Us Rock."
 Oh.
 Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you dont hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, theyre all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
 Lets do it.
 Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
  Wow. I dont know how youre gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
 Yes.
 Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
 Lets take a look. Nice.
 What?
 Oh, my God, thats Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, hes the drummer and the singer.
 Wow. Oh!
 Yeah, you havent seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. Im gonna call the label, were gonna...
 No, Pam, youre gonna lose him to another wedding.
 Kev!
  I will raise.  Thanks.
 Its the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
 Yeah, right.
 What was this?
 Really?
 Wow. I think youre bluffing.
 Oh. Three nines.
 Thank you very much. It was fun.
 So, thats still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
 No, thanks. You having fun?
 Yeah, we all really...
 Well, I think you look great.
 Yeah, why did you?
 Oh, yeah.
 No.
 Okay, will do.
 Hey, hows it going?
 Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
 No, I...
 I was just... Im in love with you.
 Im really sorry if thats weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
 I just needed you to know. Once.
 Yeah.
 Dont do that.
 Come on. I dont wanna do that. I wanna be
  You have no idea how long Ive wanted to do that.
 No Im not drunk.  Are you drunk?
 Are you really gonna marry him?   ...Ok.
  I cant say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
  Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think thats pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you cant beat that view... right?
 Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
 OooOK.
 I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I dont think any of them actually know my real name.
 Oh, I can do that.
  Whats gay-dar?
 I miss that.
 Its really good to see you, man.
 Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
 No, its not. I did. Yep.
 You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
 Oh, Dwight. Ive missed you so much.
 That is a lot of liquor.
 And a dart board.
 Oh, no, sorry, its an inside joke. Theres this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? Youd just have to be there.
 Yeah.
 All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
 Oh yeah?
 Oh, tell him I say hi.
 Hey, how is... Toby?
 Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
 Michael, its really not a competition.
 Michael.
 Dwights room key. And... Dwights room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
 Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I dont even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
 Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
 Can I get a drink?
 Can I get a drink?
 Yeah.
 Michael...
 Wait, wait. I didnt transfer because of you. Youre a good boss. Youre a great boss.
 Michael, its not about... I transferred because of Pam.
 No, I just... I heard something about that. Its just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
 Nope, thats okay.
 Thats all right.
 Yeah. Okay, maybe.
 Hey.
 How are you?
 No, we used to. Now were friends.
 At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and theyre all really into it.  Im told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didnt play many video games in Scranton.  Instead wed do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
 Im just killing Germans, any way I can.
  Wait, are we playing teams?
 Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.    Ok, see you next week.  Bye.   Again?
 Oh, Im sorry I dont know... what were talking about...
 Um, sniper rifle?
 Im sorry what are you whispering about?
 Im trying---
 Oh.
 What?
 Wow. Psychopath.
||
 Oh yeah, definitely.
 Whats up?
 Oh.
 Mmm, thats where youre wrong.  Im your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that were not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
 Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market.
 Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
 Really?
 Oh, theres no game.  Were just trying to get these chips for Karen.
 I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
 And then we checked the fax machine.
   Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herrs salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and havent ... . yeah.  You have em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  Ill call you back.  Shut up .
 Nice!
 Sounded good.
 Whered I find what?
 I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
 What?
 Is it?
 No, I didnt. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didnt take your chair.
 So I guess I cant get up.
 Sure.
  Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
 Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
 fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
 Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
 Ah, hey.
 Hi.
 Sorry, I forgot Kevins extension. Its a fantasy football thing.
 And I was just going to go through the system cause I didnt think youd be there. Why, why are you still there?
 Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
 So...
 Oh, Im sorry. Go ahead.
 Oh, good.
 What time is it here? Um, were in the same time zone.
 How far away did you think we were?
 Yeah. I have a question for you.
 How many words per minute does the average person type?
 Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesnt even type 90.
 Ok, I said average.
 Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
 No.
 65. Ok, no need to laugh.
 Respectable?
 Right.
 Ok.
 Yeah.
 I know!
 No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
 No, youre making this up!
 Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
 And how many kitchens?
 Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
 Most apartments these days have like three.
 Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
 Pam?
 Pam?
 Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
 Oh, no no.
 Yeah, uh, well.
 Ok.
 Yeah. Bye Pam.
 Sorry.
 I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
 Thank you.
 Scuse me?
 Wow.
 Yup.
 Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
 Whats that?
 Yep.
 Oh, Holy Mother of God.
 Good.
 Oh.
 Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
 Okay.
 Oh.
 Im a drunk driver.
 Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
 No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if thats all right.
 So good.
 Hey.
 Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
  I dont have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwights stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."
 Really? Wow... thats bad.
 Well, I work here now.
 I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, its going to be weird that its all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
 Hey, do you have a second?
 I know its not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know whos coming over here from Scranton?
 Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
 What does that mean?
 Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
 Wow.
 Thank you.
 No, its just Im not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
 No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And Im not really ready to revist that, I dont think.
 Okay.
 I really dont know.  How you doing with all this?
 Youd actually move to Scranton?
 New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you Id move to New York?
 Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... its not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
 Okay.
 The Stamford branch is closing and everybodys just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
 Yeah.
 You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
 Sounds good Andy.
 Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, Im out of here. See you later?
 Right.
 Okay.
 Hi, Im Jim. Im new here.
 Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how wed never met...
 Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
 You, too.
 Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, were friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
 Hey, Dwight.
 Okay. Sounds good.
 I dont know what youre talking about.
 No. Looks good.
 Im not.
 I am.
 Okay.
 Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
 Oh, Im sorry. Are you sitting here now?
 Oh.
 You know, man, its really youre call.
  Let me get that for you.
 This one taken? No. Good.
 Hey, Toby!
 How are you, man?
 I just wanted to say hi.
 Oh. Is that like your new thing?
 No. Its cool.
 All right. Good to be back.
 All right.
 No problem.
  ...what?
 Kelly!
 Really?
 Great. Whats new with you?
 Oh, this looks promising.
 It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. The Scranton Witch Project.
 Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
 Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
 You feel good?
 All right.
 Hey!
 Oh yeah. Im trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
 Well, Im evolving, Pam.
 Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. Im uh just still getting settled.
 Okay.
 Nope. Youre not interrupting anything. Nope. Im...
 Dont...
 All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
 All right!
 Does he ever.
 Yeah, it does, actually.
  Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
  Whats wrong? You didnt have a good first day?
 Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
 Ok, thanks.
 Hey.
 I thought you had already... left.
 Oh... Good.
 Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
 I just think I should tell you that... Ive sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
 O..ok. Um..good.
 Right.
 Yeah. Good to be back.
 Hey.
 Just about... yup. Now.
 Yes. I have started to see Karen. Its very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
  Jim Halpert.
 ...Okay I cant... help you... with that.
 She is dating Ryan, I think.
 Shes... high-maintenance.
 Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
 ...Absolutely you should.
 I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
 Frisbee-based competitions...
 She...
 Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
 Jonas Salk.
 Justin Timberlake?
 What is that, like... five pounds?
 Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
 Quick question - do you play the guitar?
 Hold on, let me think about that, yes, thatll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
 Yup. Thats perfect.
 Hey.
 Perfect.
 ...Im messing with Andy. Im sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
 ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
 Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... well give her a break. Lets think of someone else.
 Where... did you learn all of this?
 So, not prison.
 Whatd you do, Prison Mike?
 That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
 Well, youre... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
 Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
 Merry Christmas Dwight.
 Wow. What have we got here?
 Dead goose.
 All right.
 Wow. Win-Win.
 Wow. What kind of bike is that?
 But the paints chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
  Oh, I think youre supposed to put a toy
   Carol.
 Its a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michaels a bold guy.  Is bold the right word?
 What?
 Are you serious?
  Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
  You know what? Uh, I really dont think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
 No, because of the promotion.
 It just feels a little bit, like...
 I feel like theres a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
 Will they still air Rudolph?
 Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And thats what you want, right?
 OK, I think I can help here.
 As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
 Could you please keep it down?  Im in session. Ive determined that this committee is valid.
 Permission denied.
 OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
 Yes.
 No, its not.
 Oh,  shes asleep.
 Probably.
 And shes trying to correctly butcher a goose, but shes having trouble coming up with it.
 Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, its pretty much the same thing.
 Im sure theyll want to meet her, too.
 All right
 What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
 Thank you.
 No. She wasnt.
 Well, for starters, Ive known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago.
 Sorry.
 You what?
 Yeah.
 You just had a rebound.
 Yeah. Which, dont get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when its over, youre left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
  Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
 Oh no, that would be great.
 Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
 All right, lets get started. Umm... Oh, first off, were supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... lets push cardstock this week. Uh, also...  what is this?
 For what?
 OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
 Oh my God, Dwight, whatre you doing?
 Youre not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
 Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, thats making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! Hes got a knife!
 No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanleys neck?!
  Dwight Schrute is now wearing a babys bonnet.
 Oh my God, Karen, youre right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
 You want to talk about it?
 Yep, its English, its "impossible."
 Yikes.
 Fantastic.
 Hey.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Yes. Um, Im just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
 Really?
 So, I dunno, I just feel likes weve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
 Hmm, what?
 Yeah, I guess.
 Hey, thanks a lot.
 Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
 Urkel Grue.
 Uh, I think you dropped this
 Definitely.
 Hello.
 Yeah, you can.
 For this?
 Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michaels new friend.
 Oh well, Yoy should bring in Long Tim in one day. Shouldnt he?
 Yeah. Right?
 Ok.
 Yup. Ill trade.
 Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
 Seriously? Youre going to sit in the back?
 You still do that thing?
 After you sir.
 Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
 We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
 Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
 We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
 And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
 We can custom make them.
 Sure, thats true we cant compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
  And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
 Hey, Kelly, its Jim.
 Thanks.
 Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
 We should go on a double date.
 Sure. Look at you!
 Beesley, coffee?
 All right.
 Yeah.
 No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.
 Which one was it?
 Cool.
 Oh
 Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
 Congratulations.
 Big deal.
 Ok.
 Pam? Did I ever have a thing for her? No, why? Did she say something?
 Yeah. Ok, heres the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didnt feel the same way. So, it didnt amount to anything, and I left. Im really glad youre here. Kay?
 Hey man.
 Is that you singing?
 Nice job.
 You gonna answer it?
 Yikes.
 Thank you.
 I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
 Hey.
 So Andy is in rare form today.
 Encourage him? Im the victim, okay? Hes fishing for me. Weve got to do something.
 Fine. Party pooper.
 Hey, Ryan?
 You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
 I liked you better when you were the temp.
 Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
 Okay, good. Stay right here.
  Are there any messages?
 So weird.
 No.
 What are you talking about?
 You know what?  Maybe its in the ceiling.
 Okay.
  Oh my God, thats half-inch drywall.
  "Its not freakin funny!"
 Hey.
  Yes.
 Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
 Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
 Hey.
 Ugh.
 Oh yeah.  Why?
 Oh.  Yeah well, I guess theres been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
 Yeah, I know I should.
 No, Im sure youre right.
 Really?
 Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
 Absolutely not.
 Stop.  Thats disgusting.
 Fine.
 Sally.
 Blonde.
 Are you okay?
 Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
 Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
 Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
 Have you ever seen a stripper before?
 Yeah, me neither.
 Hi.
  Oh God.
 Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
 Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  Im glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
 Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
 In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks Ive been conducting a similar experiment.
  Dwight, want an Altoid?
  Altoid?
  Mint Dwight?
 What are you doing?
 What?
 So whats in the box?
 Those flowers are nice.
 Phyllis and Robert.
 You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
 Did you ever see that movie?
 You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
 Hey.
 When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
 Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
 I know. Its very cute.
 Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, its totally hypothetical.
 Heres a not hypothetical. Im really happy Im with Karen.
 Pams with Roy. Im with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin on.
 Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six.
 Im sorry what did you say? So wierd...
 The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. Theres no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well.
 Ow!
 That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. Its white hot.
 What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
 Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
 The glare off Angelas crucifix? Its blinding.
 So... youre cool to just wait here for animal control?
 Cool. Okay. Im gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... theres just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
 Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you cant get out, you dont want anyone to help you?
 Another worm? Like, are they friends?
 Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Oh. Um. I think were good.
 Yeah.
 Why dont I wanna go? Didnt expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I dont know any of these people. Its an obligation. I dont like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
 Yep.
 Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
 Gotcha. Alright.
 Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
 Oh. Hadnt noticed.
 No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
 Oh.
 You stay here and have fun, because Im going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
 Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me.
 So, none of them?
 Really?
 Ok.
 I dont know. Where to begin? My ball.
 I dont know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
 Agoraphobic?
 Really?
 Absolutely correct.
 Kev, have a good weekend.
 Here we go...
 Ok...
 Sounds good.
 Hey...
 I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
 Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
 Okay.  Um... Got you something.
 You dont know what it is.
 It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
 Whered you get that?
 Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left Ive been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
 I cant hear you.
 Still nothin.
 No.
 Nice.
 Okay.
 And what happens in this one?
 Okay.
 Can I have a raise?
  Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
 What?
 I didnt say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
 So, none of that tipped you off?
 Yeah, that was nuts.
 No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
 Well see.  Im sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
 Oh, yeah.  Dont worry about it.
 Ok, if you dont want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
 Boy I---
 Its like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and hes like an eel.  I just cant grab onto him.  Its infuriating.
 Well... yes, thats probably what it is.  So what do I do?
 Thanks, Kev.  Im good though.
 Whats what?
 Wow.  I guess word got around.  Thats a nice... honor.
  Didnt think youd notice...
  I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
 Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
 Whats that?
 No, Im not gonna call you that.
 Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
 Dwight says that he actually doesnt know one single fact about bear attacks.
  Andy!  Nah, thats too far.
 You really wanna bet?
 Ok, youre on.
 No, dont worry about it.  Well just got double or nothin.
 I dont know, well figure somethin out.
 Theres like ten green ones.
 Im gonna say fifty.
 Oh, dont be that person.
 Kevs out.
 Id say like... 10,000 to 1?
 Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
 Oh, excuse me.  Its my... favorite part.
 Oh my God, there
 Oh.  Hes going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
 Hey uh, Michael.  Dont jump on the bouncy castle.  You cant do that, because youre going to get horribly, horribly injured.
 Dwight...
  Its kind of blurry.  Thats better.  Question.  What kind of bear is best?
 False.  Black bear.
 Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
 Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And thats a grand total of...  eleven dollars.
 ... MICHAEL!
  Absolutely.  I couldnt be more sorry about this.
 One more.  Why are you talking like that?
 Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
 All right.
 Yeah, Im definitely gonna go alone.
 Oh, did the press ask for a story?
 Whats that?
 You know her name.
 Its fine.
 What about music?  Do you have any music?
 I was thinkin about more like a CD, or... a CD.
 Lord, beer me strength.
 Did that
 Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
 Which one... is she?
 Wow.
 No, I dont think so.
 Nope.
 No.
 No.
 Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We dont have a
 Andy--- Ohh...
 Oh my God.
 Well... thats not gonna hold up in court.
 All right.
 Not important.  Because youre not dating her.  Because its a felony.
||
 Absolutely.
 And you should.
 Andy... is having a
 "Good luck."
 You want music?
 Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think youll be all right.
  A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
 Do you?
 OK.
  Look at that.
 Spot on.
  Hey.
  Oh, whats this?
  "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.
 Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
 Lay it on me.
 Now that sounds serious.
 Which would be me.
 OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
 Oh, you dont want to know.
 OK, Ill call the
  OK.
  Thank you.  The police are on it. They say theyve already had three calls.
 Mm... not really, no.
  Question. Wont that interfere with your other task forces?
 Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
 Why dont you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
 No. Thank you, though.
 Not really. Ive seen a bathroom before.
 I think you mean a girls
 Go crazy.
  Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
 Anna Marias.
 Six-month anniversary. What?
 No, weve been dating for six months.
 Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said shes not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
  That is pretty cool.
 Hey, Dwight. Its Jim.
 No, youre not. Im looking right at you.
 Dont.  I have information about the sex predator.
 I saw him two minutes ago.
 In the womens bathroom, above the sink.
 Really? Not Slytherin?
 I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
  Woah, stop, stop, stop. Theres a hole. Step over the hole.
 Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
  Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes!
 You cant say, or you cant pronounce it?
 What are you doing?
 Yeah. No. Good.
 Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a mans eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
  Great. Yeah, Ill see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
 In well?
 How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
 Wait a minute.
 If this job is in a well, I dont want it.
 I dont!
 Nope.
 Oh, cause I dont want my feet to get burned.
 Thats harsh.
 And that is not the same at all. If youre going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
 Hey, I know what youre looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really dont think I should be considered as your replacement.
 Michael, on Thursday Im going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
 Hey, Kev.
 Thank you.
 Ohhh...
 No.
 No way.
  Andy...
 Nothing.
 Yup.
 Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
 Thanks, Pam.
 Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, lets do it.
 So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early cause we want to spend the night in the city.
 Whoops.
 Hmmm.
 Ah, were gonna go tonight, but were gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
 All right.
 Yeah, Im not going to talk about this now.
 You sure?
 Wow.
 Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else?
 Hm. Really tough call.
 You know what? Why dont you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
 All right.
 Oh hey, Dwight.
 Does my room have cable?
 Can I change rooms?
 Can I have a late checkout?
 Youre not the manager even in your own fantasy?
 Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
 Go.
 Thanks.
 Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
 Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
 Oh...
 Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
 Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
  Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. Its in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. Thats when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
 Oh do you mean when I get the job?
  Whos that?
 Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
 Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really dont have to stay, if you dont want.
 Okay.
 Sure.
 Thank you.
 I should leave.
 Thanks.
 Im sorry, wait, so is the question "Howd I get to be so awesome?"  Because, I dont have an answer for you.
 Yes, absolutely.
 Oh, no, absolutely.
  There you go.
  Whats that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, theres just a  energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.   So thats a... bonus.
  The friendships.
  How are your feet?
 The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
 And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like Ive never really... come back.
 Pam.   Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
 All right.  Then... its a date.
 Really, what kind of celebrity?
 How much did you pay for it?
 You paid for it?
 I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didnt mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... Im single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
 Oh that sounds fun. Im mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
 Yeah.
 What?
 Who was driving?
 One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
 Oh good, so we dont have to work.
 I can also take 3 people.
 I think shes awake.
 I wouldnt... I wouldnt worry about it. Dont touch it.
 I will do some research.
 Six of one, really.
 So whats your strategy for this race?
 Mm-hmm.
 What?
 Why wont more people do that?
  What?
  Oh, ah... No thats not... I mean that wasnt, ah...
 I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
 Right!
 Wow! There it is.
 It is going really great.
 Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
 Yeah.
 Bat birth control
 Which we are.
 You know what though, Ive actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
 Great, its gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
 Baquette.
 Eww.
 I can imagine.
 You couldnt have taken off all your clothes in the mens room?
  Gross.
 Alright.
  Oh, Im sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
 Oh, would you look at that.
 Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
 OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease thats already been cured.
 Thats what I thought.
 Right. Lets do some good.
 Oh, and I get to carry it.
 ...talk about it.
 What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
 Well, youre probably dehydrated.
 Glass of water would be a start.
 Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
 You are?
 Hey.
 Oh wow, thank you.
 Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
 I guess.  How dare you.
 Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
 Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
 Ohh..
 Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
 Oh.
 Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
 What?
 Oh, OK.
 Great.
 Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, Im not really sure whats wrong with it.
 Swore I wouldnt tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
 Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
 Wait. What?  You knew? And you didnt say anything?
 Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
 Oh no, were just sitting here.
 OK.
 And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
 Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
 Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
  Nice to meet you.
 Hey.
 Alright I just have to ask now that were public, um, is the magic gone?
 I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
 Be honest.
 Thats honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?
 For me, it was.
 Alright.
 Why dont we just go by ourselves?
 What about a gift basket full of cash?
 Yeah, hes definitely something.
 That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
 I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
 Into a lake.
 Hey.
 Oh wow, thank you.
 Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
 I guess.  How dare you.
 Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
 Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
 Ohh..
 Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
 Oh.
 Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
 What?
 Oh, OK.
 Great.
 Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, Im not really sure whats wrong with it.
 Swore I wouldnt tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
 Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
 Wait. What?  You knew? And you didnt say anything?
 Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
 Oh no, were just sitting here.
 OK.
 And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
 Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
 Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
  Nice to meet you.
 Hey.
 Alright I just have to ask now that were public, um, is the magic gone?
 I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
 Be honest.
 Thats honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?
 For me, it was.
 Alright.
 Why dont we just go by ourselves?
 What about a gift basket full of cash?
 Yeah, hes definitely something.
 That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
 I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
 Into a lake.
 I know.  I love it there.
 Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
 Sounds great.
 Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
 Theres this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
   Wait for it.
 Hey Meredith, how you feelin?
 Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
 Haha...
 Uh-huh.
  MmmHmm...
  Oh yeah.
  Alright...
  Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
  Actually it sounds like you are.
 Or zipadeedoodaah.
  I was... mocking.
  Or a gong.
  Really?  Power gel?
 What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
  What?
  Yeah, Im aware of that.  But hes also being super annoying.  And Im not a perfect person.
  Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
  Sure well go.
  Oh Im sorry.  What?
  Nope.
  Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
   Hows it going?
  Yeah?
  You look a little worried.
  Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
  Hey man.
  Whats going on?
  Oh yeah?
  Im driving?
  Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
  Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
  Yeah.
  Its not.  Its different.  But its a good book.
  What was that?
  Oh.  Two kisses.
  Gotcha.
  That would be fun.
  Uhhh.  Cant.
  Oh, no cause... youre gonna let me know when were close, right?
  Mmmkay...
 Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
  Yep.
  Are there, uh, three ws at the beginning of the address?
  Yep.
 Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
 You need to let him go.
 Yes.
 Yes, but not by kidnapping.
 As a hostage.
 I think youre under-thinking it.
 Ransom.
 What did he say?
 So, we should let him go.
 Okay.
 Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
 Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
 Okay.
 What have we got here?
 Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
 Which ones this? Perfect.
 Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
 And thats when I knew. You?
 That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
 Wow, can we make it a different moment?
 A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
  Sure, I can hold.
 Hey Dwight.
 Do you run the bed and breakfest?
 Does the Department of Health know about this?
 Uh, Michael.
 That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
 Darn it!
 No, cant.
 Where are you going out tonight?
 I wouldnt understand or a secret?
 I cant believe this place is real. I mean, Ive heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
 The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
 How are you doing this?
 Nice.
 Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
 Not even Harry Potter?
 Hmmm, Id say 1 in 6.
 Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
 You know, Ive just realized, this is Pams and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasnt made out of beets. Didnt think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
  Wait, youre going up there?
 Hey Dwight.
 Does Mose have nightmares?
 Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
 Good night, Dwight.
 You okay?
 Are you a cocktail waitress?
 No, sometimes its right.
 Dwight, hows the hotel business?
 Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
 Maybe you should.
 The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
 You will never want to leave your room.
 Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
 Yeah, I didnt think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
 Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldnt take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldnt sleep, I couldnt concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
 Ah, dinner.  Lets see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 Yep, Im very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, Im in love with Italian food.
 Nobody tell him!
 You got it, youre so close!
 Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I dont think...
 Nope.
 I think its great that the companys making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
 You playing that game again?
 Oh it has losers.
 Who are you talking to, specifically?
 Hey.
 Why dont we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you whats going on here.  Okay, this is Dwights Second Life. Hes on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. Its called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
 Yeah.
||
 Oh, its just my avatar guy. Whatever.
 Not much, its just for tracking Dwight so---
 Yep.
 I... why dont we go back to this animation.
 Ah, show me how this works.
 I hope youre not killing yourself on this, because Im sure its good enough for Michaels ad that will probably be seen by no one.
 Okay. Do you want me to stay?
 Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So Im pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
 I, ah...
 Good morning.  Yeah Im sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
 Youre welcome.
 Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
 Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott directors cut. Hope you like it.
 Animation? All her by the way.
 I just thought you should---
 Ahh.
 Oh, I dont think that is whats happening.
 So tell me again why I cant be part of your club?
 Oscar?
 So what are you going to do?
 Did they?
 We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
 What are we doing?
 Were going to Utica?
 Im not going to Utica right now.
 No.
 I cant believe you guys.  Im not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
 No, Im not calling Karen.
 What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
 Are you kidding me?
 Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brothers new baby on it, so...
 Okay.
 You know what?  Im just going to call a cab from here.
 Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
 Oh, God.
 No.
 No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
 Are you kidding me?  Weve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
 So the deal was, Dwight doesnt blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
 What?
 Okay, you know what?
  Why dont we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
 It doesnt matter.
 Doesnt matter.
 That doesnt make sense, couldnt be.
 Oh my God!
 Michael, watch the road!
 Michael! Michael, pull over!
 Pull over, pull over!
 I cant believe were here, I cant believe this is happening.
 No, Michael.  Im not leaving the car.
 Guys going by. Shh.
 No, no, you wont do that. Nope.
 Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
 Oh my God, thats her! Thats her, go, go, go.
 Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing weve ever done.
 Okay, you know what?  You dont need to be updating me as much as youre updating me.
 No, no, dont do anything to them.
 Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
 Isnt that thing huge?
 No, that is a terrible idea, dont do this.
 Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
 Damn it guys!
 Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
 No, Im not doing that.
 No, Im not doing that!
 Hey Karen.
 First of all, hi.
 You good?  Im just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
 Copy that.
 Yes?
 Yeah, trying to quit though.
 Oh no, I didnt want to see you.  Not that Im not happy seeing you, right now, Im just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, Id say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
 I mean, its just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didnt want to see... you...
  Alright, you are welcome.  Im going to go because of, um, traffic.
 I... will...
 Hey.
 Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
  Angelas Ashes, top o the morning to us.  Frankies prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
 Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 No, that wasnt fun.
 Of course I read it.
 Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
 Got it.
 Absolutely, yes.
 When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
 Yeah?
 And I am always busy.
 Oh, cant go today, cause Im donating blood.
 Is there a limit?
 Well, is that it? Or?
 How so?
 Whats that?
 Right.
 Not gonna change.
 I thought we had that looked at.
 Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
 OK, great.
 Yup.
 Thatd be great.
 Oh, wasnt it just someones birthday?
 I do remember, yeah.
 You know what, I have an idea. Why dont we just do one big shared party?
 There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
 And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And hes a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
 So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
 We can just have one big fun party. Everybodys happy, nobody wastes their time.
 Its a pretty good idea, dont you think?
 No... I think its a great idea.
 You know, try sending them another invoice.
 Alright.  Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
 Right? I was just thinking...
 Right! Exactly.  Knew I could count on you.
 Whats that?
 Oh, sure.
 OK.
 Yeah, people like me I guess.
 Well I think Meredith was just --
 Everybodys birthday.
 What do you want?
 You want a birthday pie?
 Well, Im gonna to talk to Angela and were gonna see what we can do about a pie.
 It will be Angela.
 Andy.
 Not your birthday.
 Alright, Ill look into it, but the answers no.
 Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
 Alright.
 OK, Im gonna go into this office here  to do some work. So I will be in here.
 Hey guys, whatre we talking about?
 Toby.
 Oh, thanks man.
 Is there anything --
 Oh, OK.
 What?
 I remember that.
 Seriously?
 Tobys great. Hes great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much.  I dont see the harm in that. Well, its a cake Toby, so, cmon.
 OK. Yeah, you know what, were just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
 Thats a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
 Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. Were gonna solve it right here. Were actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldnt do it.
 Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
 Hey.
 Sure glad youre back.
 You have no idea.
 Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
 So, terrible idea.
 You did do it?
 Well, I dont think Ill be here in ten years.
 Thats what who said?
 Thats what she said.
 All right, lets run it back.
 Sure.
 Wow.
 Oh, I cant beat Darryl.
 What, seriously? What is she saying?
 So youre asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
 Bring me players.
 Good game Meredith.
 Dwight! Thank God youre here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
  What the hell?
 Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
 I think Im ready.
 ...Right. Spin-serve!
 Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
 Nope I dont, remember when you told us not to make plans cause were working.
 I think you did.
 Oh, I-
 Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time weve been able to get out of it. But Ive got to give him credit, he got me. Because Im starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
 Hi.
 Lets see, since I saw you an hour ago?
 I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
 Really?
 Tour, lets do the tour first.
 Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
 Its fire.
 Just like that.
 Really? cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
 Wow.
 What is that chestnut?
 Michael, Im just terrible at all this stuff, so thats really cool.
 Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. Im surprised theyre not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
 What was that?
 Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and its called Lets see how uncomfortable we can make our guests and theyre both winning. So Im going to make a run for it.
 Youll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
 Thats true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam Ill see you at home, thank you so much.
 I dont know because I everything I own is there.
 Katie Holmes.
 Oh, Dawsons Creek.
 Not really a rhyme.
 Tom Cruise!
 Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
 Im sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jans company?
  So... how do you guys know each other?
 Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
 Nevermind.
 Thats nice.
 Its getting late.
  Of course
 Oh... my apartments on fire
 Flooded.
 You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
  I stole this.  For you babe.
 Nope I dont, remember when you told us not to make plans cause were working.
 I think you did.

    Really, nothing?
  Ah, they moved the shower.
  No, I didnt.  You know why?
  Because most of the time, friends dont talk about other friends butts.
  But what have you learned about her?
  Nice.
  Well, I tried.
  Ill just go later.
  So you have the directions.
  You have a toothbrush.
  You have a cell phone charger.
  Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
  What happened?
  Call me when you get in.
  Bye.
  Why havent I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didnt want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pams always said she doesnt want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. Im not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
  I cant believe Im saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. Its because Holly is kind of a major dork.
  I dont really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
  When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
  All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this  Go to applications--
  All right!
  So what is going on, girl in the computer?
  Uh-huh.
  Thats not what that is.
  I would like to lose 65 pounds.
  Cryogenics. Beer me five.
  All right, Im taking off.
  Nope, just going to see Pam.
  Maybe put up some shelves.
  OK, thank you for ... this.
  No.
   Hi.
  Oh, thats so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pams new art? Its right there. Check it out.
   Some girl came into Pams room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So Im in here waiting it out.
  Well thats great.   Youre talking about your court ordered community service?
  But he did, right?
  All right.
  Nope.
  Mmm.
  How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
  No, youre definitely the problem.
  Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
  Fair question.
  See, youre always saying theres something wrong with society, but... maybe theres something wrong with you.
  Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that Im convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I havent seen her in 10 days.  Hows your summer?
  So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
  I know.  I suck.
  Dwight says "Hi."
  Now he is saying "Hi" louder.
  Umm...
  Hey, can you go to IM?
  OK.
  Im gonna write you up for not working.
||
  Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
  Perfect.
||
  I just... couldnt wait.
  Pam, will you marry me?
  So?
  Hey, sorry everybody.
  Hey Dwight.
  Whats up, Meredith?
 Alright.  Ill tell everybody here that you say hi.
 Why, what happened?
 Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didnt tell them.
 I just didnt, you know, want a deal.
 OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
 Nope.
 Thank you Angela.
 Yes.
 To get married.
 Yep.
 Nice.
 Dwight, youve really never stolen any company time?
 Jackpot.
  Yawn.  Four seconds.
 Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so... Im just making sure.
 Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
  One second.
 Hey, Andy.
 By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
 Actually not.  It was really so-so.
 I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
 You know, its weird.  Its practically a shot for shot remake.
 Storys kinda bland.  Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
 He has not stopped working for a second.  At 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 132 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I havent even started work.  Its exhausting, being this vigilant.  Ill probably have to go home early today.
  19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
 So I guess I can assume that was personal.
 So maybe youre not completely ethical after all.
  Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through  delusion.
 Right, the one from England.
 Oh. Right, that style.
 OK...
 Wait, whos Sarah Kayacombsen?
 OK.
  No... way!
 Ha ha. Thats hilarious?
 Who, Stacy?
 Uh...
 OK, Ill ta...Ill talk to you later.   That was a good story.
  Jan.
 What do we have here?
 Really...
  Hey!  You busy?
 OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jans shower is going on right now, and shes singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyones just staring at her.
   The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - shes been singing for the last twenty minutes!
 Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
  Hey, its Jim.  Leave a message.
  Hey, its me.  It is 503.
 You must be out or something.
 Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
 Hope you didnt have any major laundry issues.
 Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
 Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, Im just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
 Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
 I miss you.
 We were robbed last night.
 So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 300 in the morning.
 Im on minute six of this message.
 The future mother of my children.
 Do you need us for any of this?
 5 dollars.
 I can see that.
 Another round, boys? Great.
 Hey man.
 Oh, I wouldnt-
 Im good. How you doing?
 Yeah, okay.
 Oh, shes good actually.
 Shes, um, shes in New York. Shes at an art school.
 Yeah, shes doing really well.
 Shes engaged, um... to me.
 Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
 Yeah, Id say shes happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 800 AM.
 What?
  I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.
  No. you know what? No. Because... Im not that guy. And  we are not that couple.
 Dave.
 You are?   A cat?
  Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
 Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
 Oh, Ill walk you out.
 All right. Well see.  No.
 I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
 Hey, how are you?
 Good to see you.
 All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
 Thats not really true. Theres a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
 Wow, thats- thats a little rude. Whats your deal?
 Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. Shes a trumpeter. And, look at her.
 That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
 Love that one.
 Here you go again! What is your deal today?
 One.
 Half.
 Also good.
 Pete couldnt make the Mets. Shes at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
 Pam, dont worry about it.
 Guys, what is going on?!
 Well, Ill be the judge of that. What do you got?
 That is good.
 Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family."
 Yeah, wed never do that.
 You wouldnt tell your mom?
 Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldnt know it from looking at her, but Pams a gold-digger.
 Aww.
  Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
 Nope.
 You must be really proud.
 Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
 OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee thats in here and you could use  uh, oh -- Snoopy.
 How can you even be sure?
  Make the face.  Yeah, I dont see it.
 Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
 It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
 How was your meeting with Michael?
 Was it your scores?
 Mm-hmm.
 Of course.
 Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
 Theres the charm.
 That is me. Wish me luck.
 Thanks.
 I love you, too.
 Im not talking to you.
 What?
 Did my scores drop a little?
 Are we even sure thats my file?
 Well, theres got to be an explanation.
 Yeah.
 I think you mean smug
 Michael, Im just trying to --
 I need a decent bonus, because Im actually in the process of buying my parents house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, its that you cant go wrong buying a house you cant afford. Pam doesnt know about the house, so its... a fun surprise.  Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
 A little bit. ... Worth it.
 Microgement.
  Hello?
 Wow, thats great, because I need paper.
 Wow, this is my lucky day.
 I am Bill Buttlicker.
 How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
 Would you hold on one second? Thats my other line.
 Hello?  No, Im just on the phone with this stupid salesman. Hes so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.
 Sorry. That was a family emergency.
 You know what? Thats private.
 Sorry, youre going to have to speak up a little bit louder. Im hard of hearing.
 Youre gonna have to talk louder.
 Son, you have to talk louder.
 Louder, son!
 Now, you listen to me, sir.
 The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
 Im irate right now.
 Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?
 Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
 Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what Im going to do? Im going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
 There is one condition, Michael.
 You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
 Dwight. Dwight.
 Are you serious?
 OK, what are you --
 Whats that?
 Whos they?
 In this car?
  What are you thinking?
 The mob, maybe NASA.
 Is there some evidence?
 How many shoes do you need?
 Im not talking to you.
 Pam.
 No, shes not.
  OK.
 Easy.
 Lets just -- Lets head back to the desk.
 Good one.
  Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
 Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
 Hey, how are you and Darryl?
 Bye.
 What was?
 No, actually.
 I dont think so.
 Hey, hows things?
 Yeah?
 Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
 Wait, thats pretty weird.
 Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
 No. What party?
 I wasnt. But thank you.  Do you know anything about this party?
 Well, I cant be the only one who didnt --
||
 Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
 Is that it?
 OK, Im gonna assume that was it. Heres the thing I think youre right. I think it was Kelly. I think shes mad at us for not coming to her party.
 Probably just Kelly.
 Thats what Im saying.
 You were right.
 You were right.
 You knew it.
 You knew it the whole time, buddy.
 Wow.
 No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Lets talk about this.
 We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
 Whos that?
 Oh, thats gonna be great. Whos Chuck Close?
 Thats it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
 Im gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
 Dont.
 Why are you telling us this?
 Where are you going?
 Where is it?
 Okay.
 Six point five days.
 Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
  Are you sure?
 Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
 Okay, okay, its no big deal.  So youre not a computer geek.
  W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
 Its not--- Its not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
 And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
  You okay?
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Love you too.
  How does everyone know already?
 Excuse me?
 Im gonna grab a cup of coffee.
 Thanks man.
 I missed you.
 Welcome back.
 So why did you come in here?
 Why is that, why is that weird?
  Shes probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
 Toby works here again.
 Oh no.
 You dont know.
 You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if hes, see if hes back.
 Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didnt tell you that.
 Thats really not cool.
 Yeah, I guess technically Kev, youre right.
 Todays a big day.  Todays the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But its my parents house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  Its got shag carpets.  I mean you cant blame my parents it was the 70s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.   Shes gonna love it.  Right?
 Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
 Oh thanks, Phyllis.
 Oh, its on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
 Definitely we should.
 Mmhmm, yeah.
 Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
 No.
  Im always this close.
 Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
  Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
 Cool.
 I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now  open your eyes.  Tadah!
 I bought it.  Its ours.  Lets go inside, Ill show you inside.   So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation.   Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.   This is the master bedroom but, Im actually not allowed in here so...
  So Im still in the process of converting the garage.  Its got great light in here and Im thinking, it could be perfect  for an art studio.   Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and its doesnt look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand its just---
 You do?
 Really?
 Oh my God...
 Yeah, I did.
 No, No, well just board that up.  Itll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
 Yeah, I cant... really cant move him.
 Uh, actually, Im gonna go with copier.
 Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I dont have to agree on everything.
 You have to make the decision.
 Hey.
 Mmhmm.
 Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
 Yeah.
 Beesly, are you threatening me?
 Okay.
  Whew.
 Woah, you guys going to lunch?
 Mind if I join?
 All right.
 Lets go.
 Lets do it.
 Where we going?
 Michael, that is hilarious.
 Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
 Yeah.
 You look really pretty.
  You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
 Yeah?
 There they are.
 You got it.
 Okay.
 Oh!
  We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... Ill double-check that for you.
 Let me call you right back. Okay.
 Wait, what?
 Truce?
 Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, Im going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.  Totally kidding.  Im gonna need four.
 Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
 Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
 I think itll take you a little longer than that.
 Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
 Thats the Christmas spirit.
 Yes.
 I will grant you one wish.
 Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.  Dumb.
 What is it?
 Wow, that is delicious.
 Cant believe no ones thought of that.
  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
 Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
 Thats cool.
 Well what if we cant do it quickly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but youre gonna need a permit for that.
 Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
  Theyve been in there for 45 minutes.
  Hey.
 Do you take requests?
 Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
 You did not know it.
 Everyone knew some of it.
 You knew it.
 She knew it.
 No, no, no, its not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
  No, no. Nope.
 Nothing.
 Why dont... Lets...
 How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
 Ahh!
 No, no.
 I know.
 Andy still doesnt know that Angelas having an affair with Dwight. And its been seventeen days. I mean, eventually hell figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now its just... awkward.
 We cant figure that out.
 No.
 Please stop.
 When?
 This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
 Stop. What?
 Okay, listen.
 This shouldnt happen at work.
 And!
 This shouldnt be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
 Well its not too late, because you havent done anything.
 But youre leaving...
  What are you standing for?
 Youre not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
 Dwight, Im in charge when Michaels gone, and I need you to sit...
 You okay, man?
 Hey guys, why dont we, uh, just cool off a bit?
 Nope.
 Okay, you know what? Thats enough. Because...
 Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
 So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
||
 Thanks Meredith.
 Dwight! Are your legs broken?
 Andy, are you all right?
 Looks like a red wire.
 Well its a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
 Doesnt it?
 Dwight, I am really busy, I cant talk about this anymore.
 I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal.  Oh hell be fine. I made it up there.
 Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
 Okay, okay, okay. Why dont we just put this to a vote, and then well be done with it.
  No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand.  Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand.
 Thank you, accounting department.
 I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people.
 Kevin, you know what, why dont you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you  and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot?  Does that end the debate?
  This close.
 OH!
  Im saying, all Im saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all Im saying.
 Back door.
 Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on.
 What?!
 No, no, no! Dont give him mouth to mouth for this!
  No. Michael. Michael.
  Michael! Michael!
 Hows that gonna help you?
 Right.
 And we dont know how.
 Punishment fits the crime.
  Whats going on?
 Uh, no one really knows, but Pams parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
 I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what theyre saying to everyone else, then--
 You couldnt of memorized that?
 Gimme a break.
  Can you believe this?  He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
 Hey.
 Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
 What?
 Mmm...
  Im ok, Im not, great, and um...
 Dont open your eyes.
 What?
 Oh my God. Pam, I dont know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, Im so sorry, I dont know. Ill call him again.
 Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
 Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
 Do ya?
 Ok. Remember Spider face?
 OK. Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
 Yeah... yep.
 Yep. Youre being replaced.
 He just sent a text...
 So what did he say? Was it my fault?
 You ok?
 Are you alright?
 This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
||
||
 Thats pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
 What the heck? Is that, uh...
 I didnt, Ill look somewhere else.
 All right.
  Hey, Kelly.
 Whoa! What was that all about.
  Go ahead.
 Okay.
 Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
  Just, easy.
 Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
 So this is fun.
 We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
  Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
 Okay.
  Are you kidding?
 Dwight. This,  fits in the palm of my hand. You havent blown em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
 What is that?  It is your birthday period.
 Not even an exclamation point?
 I cant believe how bad this looks.
 Okay, good then.
 I am working on it.
 Six dollars.
 I said I was working on it.
  How olds Kelly?
 Its Mose. Who do you think it is?
 Look, Im at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
 Do you think Im calling you for your best approximation?
  So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kellys party.
 Oh, great.
||
 Hey! What the hells goin on?
 What?
 Yep.
 Got it.
 Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
 Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
 And... ta da.
 How do you hate it? Its a cake.
 Right.
 I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still dont know.
 Birthday.
 Okay, you know what, next time, Ill let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
 Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
 Hey, whats that show that shes always talking about?
 You know what? I could use a little help.
 We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what youve been doing, is making a sign?
 Youve been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the partys now at 3!
 Im not writing, "Horse Hunt." I dont even know what that means.
  Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
 Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
 Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. Thats disgusting, and it doesnt count. So give me another one.
 Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
  Didnt see that one coming.
 Not a surprise.
 What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
 You havent heard our theme, though.
 Thats the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
 Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
 Yeah?
 No.
 All right.
 Ahem. This is for you... and  ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
 Thanks.
  Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
 Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we dont need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
 Jimbo!
   Ayyyy!
 Ayyyy!
 Youre only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
 Yeah.    Shes fine.
 Theyre for her to look at, Michael.
 Yes, lets have a word.
 Oh, Im sorry.
 I understand that.
 Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
 We do.
 That sounds fun.
 I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines arent gonna sweep themselves.
 Oh yeah, I understood.
 No way, a 280?
 Yikes.
 No.  Bob, no. No!
 That is a lie, that is a lie.
 But! That girl mustve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
 Nobody asked, Bob!
 I think if you ordered hot food youre allowed to eat.
 Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
 We should help him out.
 Here they come.
 No, just kidding.  Seriously though, thats enough.
 Oh great, I have to cover?
 Well they didnt dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
 We were.
  Empty.
 Oh boy.
 OK.
 So...
 Oh initially I did.
 Ding Dong.
 KGB.
 Ding dong.
 Ding dong.
 The KGB will wait for no one!
 We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
 Free paper.
 What are you doing?
  Why dont you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, youll know.
 What power?
 Well guys with girlfriends dont.
  Hey, Tom. Whats that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.  One of my clients found a golden ticket.   Yup. No, congratulations.
  Ill take that down right now.
 Im on the phone.
  Hold on one second.
  Its actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
  Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, whats that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesnt.
 How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
 OK...
 ...well Im going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didnt lose half my sales.
 So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so Im a little pissed too.
 Absolutely not, Im mad at you.
 Good one.
 All Im saying is that its a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
 No, that is what I mean.
 No, stop it.
 You cannot take the fall for him.
 He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
 There it is.
 You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, youve been talking about that movie for years.
 And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
 Yeah, lets face it. This meeting sounds like its Wonka fans only. Hes never seen the movie.
 Who is it?
 Alright. I just got out of the shower, Ill be one second.
 Yeah, Im late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, its a whole routine.
 If you want to come back then, thatll be fine.
 I get back from work around 6.
 You can try. That, that might work.
 Alright.
   I dont know. Is it classy enough?
  I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
  And of course, classy.
  Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that Im taking it very seriously.
  Thats it. Or Mr. Peanut.
  Oh, Dwight, youre trying too hard, and thats just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is its a state of mind.
  Ok, well lets just try this one on for size. And I apologize because its right off the top of my head  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
  Thats inspired.
  De classé.
  Hey.
  Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
  Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
  Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
  I didnt think youd notice.  Uh, its funny actually, theres another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
  Oh, youd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, theres probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
  Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it...
  I thought itd be funny.
  Thanks, Charles.
  No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
  You pet the animals and they pet you back.
  Hey.
  Alright, Charles, Ive gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, Im a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
  Second-in-command to Michael.
  Oh, thats because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
  Assistant regional manager, yeah.
   No, not exactly.
  Alright, I will, um, Im just gonna let you get back to that.
  Yep.
  See ya. See ya.  Bye!
  And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
   About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
  You called any headhunters?
  Right, cause thats what we are talking about.
   Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
  Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
  I would prefer not to.
  Youre starting your own paper company?
  Why?
  Do you know the industry is in decline?
  Right.
  No, I did that before, it added nothing.
  Okay.
  I am not gonna do this.
  And you are not going to, either.
  Heres the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because theyre set up to do that kind of thing.
  Hey.
  Nothing, just talking.
  I didnt... no.
  I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
  Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
  What?
  What? Pam!
  Pam! You cant be serious.
  Still no.
  Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
  Ill bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
  You gonna answer that, Kev?
 Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?  I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
 No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
 It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
 Here we go.
 Kev, cmon.
  Would you please stop that?
 Youre breathing very heavily.
 No its not.
 Oh no. I was just -
 ... Yes.
 Ive never been a kiss up. I - its just not how I operate. I mean, Ive always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
 Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
 Its cause Im more of a player.
 You bet.
 Well I do.
 I play.
 Well, maybe you should get back to work.
 Maybe we will someday.
 Yeah.
 Lets... eh... see ya.
 Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
 Oh, there he goes.
 Yikes.
 Aw, man.
 Oh! Goal!
 Aw, its gonna be the  worst.
 Left.
 Forward, definitely.
 Striker!
 Alright! Lets do it.
 Kickoff.  My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.  Alright!
 What?
 Okay, Im just gonna go get some ice.
 Im sorry, Phyllis.
 LOVE the hair.
 You realize youre not actually talking to me, right?
 The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. Its not the worse plan shes ever had.
 Hi!
 Sure!
 Okay.
 What the hells a rundown?
 When did you need that rundown by?
 Okay.
 Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. Im gonna dive in. To the rundown. Ill be exhausted cause its like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
 Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
 "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
 "This rundown better be really good"?
 Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
 No. I cant. It was like, hours ago.
 Oh, this is just something Im taking a break with.
 I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
 Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown youre looking for ?
 Keeping it simple -thats what Im doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
 No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
 No, I....
 Hey!
 Okay.
 Theres the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you werent prepared for.
 Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
 No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
 The one I have. Ill use the one I have.
 Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
 Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that cant be right.
 Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
 I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
 I think she just didnt want a crucifix cake.
 Am I going down a road?
 Its so scary how right the things youre saying are. And youre coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
 I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
 Hey, Andy. You know Ive been thinkin about what you said-
  -I just dont know if I can do it.
 Its just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. Im pretty emotionally needy.
  You know that I was doin this.
 Okay.
  I just totally blew a sales call.
 Yeah, well, with you its different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
 Why? When I look in the mirror, I dont like the face that looks back.
 Forget it.
 I said forget it.
 Oh, God.
 Hey.
 Okay.
 Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
 And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you dont think youre ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
 Oh, theyre my client.
 Hey, David.
||
 Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
 Really? Does he do good work or--
  Hey. I saw you called.
 Youre just out of business?
 Oh, yeah, well dont worry about it.  Well figure it out.  Well be okay.
 Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.   Oh, thats my new "Dwight" ring.
  Good, right?  Hello.
 Oh, okay.  Dont worry about it.
 Now, this is the projection over three months?
 Oh, but you didnt.
 Oh, I dont know. You know, theyve taken a good deal of clients, so--
 I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
 Okay, so Ill be back in, um-- back in a bit.
 Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
 Actually here for something else.
 You know I love a good guessing game, but why dont I just tell you what Im here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
 David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
 Oh!
 Oh!  See Im here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
  Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
 Missed the last part.
 Got it.
 Great work Dwight.
 No, I mean, great detective work.  Cause this must be the first case youve ever cracked, right?
 What are your top five cases?
  Because youve solved zero cases.
 Got it.
  Can you give us a hint?
 Can I address that?
  Okay.
 Of course.  What is like a hostage?
 Strongly-painted picture.
 Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
 Great.  See you upstairs.
 Hey, you have a second?
 Yeah, I think youre going to want to cool it with that cause its starting to upset the other salesmen.
  This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
 I know.  Yeah, its...kinda--
 Thats true.  Thats right.  Yeah.
 Well, what if I just do this?
 Im just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  Hes winning.  I feel like Im describing a dream I had.
  Oh, Im engaged to Pam.
  Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
 Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
 I dont want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
 Eh, shes nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
 Well, thats--
 Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
 He definitely stole my iPod.
  You didnt hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
 Mm-hmm.
 Thats not true.
  I think shed be a really good salesperson.
 And I wont.
  All right.  Youre right, sometimes when shes tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But thats not a weird voice.
  Take it easy.
 Not cool.
 There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
 So, it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
 Ok. So, were going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
 Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and thats great but then you have to invite -
 No one.
 Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."
 That makes sense.
  These are for you.
 You ready?
 We should probably stop by. Itd mean a lot to him.
 Were gonna stay.
 Yeah. At least for one more dance.
 Yes.
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 Yeah.
 Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so were all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 500 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
  Okay, Im gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
  Three, two, one...
  All right, you ready for this?
 Yeah.
 Wait, should I have left the car running?
 Come on, who doesnt like a picnic?
 I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
 Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
 Well...
 Hey, how are you?
 Yeah.
 I dont get it. Hes not even my boss anymore.
 No, I shouldnt have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
 Well, I couldve died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
 Nice job, Beesly.
 You all right?
 You sure?
 Hey, easy, easy...
 All right, you know what? Youre just trying to get rid of our best player.
 No, uh-
 All right, you know what?  Lets do this.
  Yeah, shes with the nurse right now, so youll have to stall a little longer... No, dont send in the subs yet... Dwight, I dont know. Think of something!
  Oh, Dwight, were so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so Ill call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.  Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs!  Ohh!
  This... is Parkour.  Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. Its pretty impressive.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
 Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
 Wait, theres not gonna be a shotgun?
 No shotgun... cause that changes everything.
 What are you gonna do about it? Theres no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
  You have to stop this.
 I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
 Do you know if its true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
  Youre gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
 Oh, I dont really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
 Yep.
 Are you... interested in her guy friends?
 Okay.
 Really.
 Well you gotta figure this out.
 Yeah!
 You gotta have sex with a woman.
 And a man.
 And then compare.
 Yep.
 On what?
||
  Can I talk to you for a second?
  So, they know.
 I didnt tell anyone! Who did you tell?
 Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
 Yeah, sure, but... whos been saying all that stuff?
 Michael, dont.
 Michael...
  That Pams pregnant.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Four months.
 Nope.
  Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
 If everyone would like to see proof.
 Michael, we only told our parents last week.
 I did. It was inconclusive.
 Dont take it.
 You cant do this.
 That sounds terrible.
||
||
   Sure.
   Ah, this is just me and David, if thats okay.
   Who was that?
   No, I wont.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
   I didnt tell Michael because I thought hed try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
   Sure.
   When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
   Why dont we head in your office to talk?
   Michael, look Ill just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
   Michael, did you say anything?
   Really?
   You will?  Wanna do it right now?
   I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
   How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
   So instead, you screwed me?
   No.
   Hi David.
   Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
    Thank you.
 Ah, ah, ah. Wheres the "please"? Were not animals.
 No, not without a "please."
 Im sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
 Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
 Okay. And how do you feel?
 All right. Did he hit you?
 Did you cry?
 Did you feel like crying?
 Im just gonna write "held back tears."
 If you stop crying, Ill stop writing it.
 Michael...
 Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
 I have noticed that we--
 Thank you. Ive noticed weve been having a lot of conference room meetings.
 And Im wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
 Yes.
 Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
 Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
 I am.
 Right.
 Yes, I agree.
 I just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day.
 You mean on a weekend?
 How about this? I think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential.
 Really? You just agreed to that?
  Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
 Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
 Stanley?
 Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these.
 Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
 Thats not what I meant.
 I disagree.
 Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
 That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
 Thats exactly what Wallace told us.
 Im not bossing you around. Im trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
 Hey, David. You got Jim here.
 Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
 David, I know that Im very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
 Nope, not at all.
 Alright, thanks alot, David.
 You dont have to lie.
 Right.
 Alright. Lets get started.
 Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
 Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
 Its hard to tell so far.
 Im sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
 You just came up with that.
 Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
 Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
 Pro-- no favoritism.
 Ive been studying Michael for years, and Ive condensed what Ive learned into this chart--  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
 You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
 I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
 Im not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
 Michael.
 Look, you have a lot of strengths.
 I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
 But there is a reason why Im here!
 No, its because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
 I dont think youre good at making tough decisions!
 At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when its an unpopular decision.
 But maybe Im here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. Ive been sitting out there, and Ive been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
||
 Could I have everyones attention, please? I have some tough news, so Im just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people wont. Now, what weve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
 Look, you guys are smart, so Im just leveling with you. Im just trying to treat you like adults.
 Ooh, easy. Thats not it at all.
 Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
 Okay, Dwight, you know what? Youd be getting the raise so--
 Wow! Im just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...
 Thank you, Meredith.
 Rank each person individually?
  Well, obviously. Too bad hes a temp and doesnt count, so lets get started.
 Nope. Im numbering the paper.
  Its going really well, actually.
  Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv-- whos that?
 Hes not a part of this. You know that.
 Okay, your move.
 Here we go.
 Okay, youre gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
 I was just trying to be unbiased.
 Uh, on a scale of one to ten, Id say Im about a four.
 Six. You?
 I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
 We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
 I just-- what?
  Michaels my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
  Thank you.
 Whats in here?
 Ooh!
 We would really appreciate it.
 It is really special.
 Well, congrats.
 Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the dont column.
 No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
 Absolutely. Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
 Thats nice.
 Good-bye.
 Yeah?
 Oh, wow. Thats cool.
  Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now thats in my brain forever.
 Lousy Picture.
 Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. Its really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
 And Beesly. Tonight were in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
 I know. Were pretty excited, too.
 I dont like that.
 Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
 Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
 Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because its just going to be blood relatives, I think.
 Pretty sure everyone heard that.
 Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
 Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
 No.
 Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
 Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, cant take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, dont get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didnt need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
 Ive been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time thats all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if youd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
 Pam cant drink? I didnt-- I shouldnt have said that. I dont know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldnt. She shouldnt because shes an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. Thats not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pams pregnant.
 Michael.
 Oh, my God. Please.
 Alright.
 To waiting.
 I cant believe it was me.
 Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
 Im so sorry.
 Oh, my God. Are you serious?
  What?
  What?
  What?
 Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but Im pretty certain Im completely wasted.
 Uh...
  And Dwight.
 Pam, it just happened.
 I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
 No. Lets talk for a long time.
 Thats not how that works.
  I may have told some people that.  Im nervous.  Im about to get married.
  Hey!
  Is this allowed?
  Wow.  You look--
  So beautiful.  Hey--
  Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, youre so pretty.
 And who cares?  Its a stupid veil, right?
 There.  Now were even.
  Well we are here now, so lets just--
  You look great.
  I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew wed need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
 Hello?
 Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
 Look, Were in Puerto Rico, so-
 Hello?
 Michael?
 How did you get this number? Michael, were on a catamaran.
 That sounds bad.
 Im gonna help you through it all right?
 All youre gonna need to  and-  it- and then go to--
 And then youll be saved.
 Just  and then youll be saved.
 A- ah--
 And youll be saved.
 I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please dont call again.
 It was.
 Really was.
 Puerto Rico was awesome.
  Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh.
 Nope.
 Do we have a conversation scheduled?
 Wow, thats... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
 Its a real handsome duck.
 Well, thats great. Congratulations. Whos the lucky lady?
 What?
 Youre messing with me.
 You did not have sex with Pams mom.
 What kind of car does she drive?
||
 Oh my God.  Oh my God.
 Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
 Oh my God.
 Not now, Toby, my God!
 Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
 No, not more than anything.
 Dont call her "the mom."
 Then take a different way home, man!
 Okay, so were good.
 Frank and beans!
 You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
 You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michaels slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
 No, it-
 Uh, I think we should just drop it... cause obviously he doesnt want to talk about it.
 Yes, you do.
 Just take the parrot.
 Okay, back to the old grind.
 Dont-
 Sounds complicated.
  Who wants a hot chocolate?
  Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
 Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
||
  I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwights birthday, what do you think?
  Really?
  I was gonna go with this one.
  And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.
  Yes!  Angela!  Please...
  Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
  Yes.
  Nothing... nothing at all... its all good!
  Barely, I... I dont have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
   Hey...
  Yep...
   Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
   Hi buddy.
  A wooden duck?
  Okay, just to be clear, youre terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
  Silence.
  I wont.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
   Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
  Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
   Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
  Well, we went on a Segway tour and were awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
  Yeah... maybe.
  Youre not, nope.  Nope.
 We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
 Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
 Wow.
 I bet we would.
 Cool.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Who doesnt?
 Oh. Actually, its just gonna be me.
 That is a mistake.
 Alright. Lets clear this up.  Well, theres actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
 Great. See ya then.
 They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
 I absolutely dont understand, either.
 Alright.
 Sure. Michaels a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. Thats what a teacher is, right?
 Dave.
 Dave.
 Yeah. Ive spoken to them on the phone.
 Yes, it is.
 No thanks.
 Mmm-hmm.
 ...and paper.
 Nope. No.
 Hes trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
 I outran it.
 Ill just leave that suit in your office then.
 Mmm... its like Michael said. It was some- something else.
 Truthfully, it wasnt the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
 Ok. Great meeting, everybody. Thats it.
 I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
 No, they dont.
 Maybe if you make fun of yourself itll all go away.
 Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
 See?
 Mm... Im, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and youre gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. Were not watchin this.
 What happened to Do Not Mock?
 That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
 Guys. Michael cant handle this and as your boss Im saying were not watching it.
 What are you doing?
 No.
 See what?
 Oscar, yes. Youre right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
 Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
 Its a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?
 I didnt ask you.  Would you like to talk?
 I shouldve grabbed you. Im sorry. Look, I thought I couldve done todays sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
  Hes alright.
 Thanks Michael.
  Oh man, thats crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
  Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  Ill talk to them.
  Thats okay.
 Its my pleasure.  Hello?  Well thats great.   Turns out the paper was there all along.
  Pams sales are fine actually.
 Wow.
 Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.
 Definitely Grandma.
 Penny for your thoughts.
 Wow.
  Shel Silverstein.
  You set the bar so high.
  Okay, so--
 Stop.
  Hey.
 Inappropriate.
  All the time.
 Yeah.
 She wants it bad Michael.
  I can.
  And I dont support her choice to hit you.
  But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
  I just need some time.
  I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
 No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
  Feel better?
  Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
  OK, so theres no defense for that, good to know.
  OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
  So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
  And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
  Oh my God, hes making you look like such a fool.
  You two are so evenly matched I dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
  Are you serious?
    We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering whats going to happen.
  Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, theyll follow along.
  Thats it.
  That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
  Alright, lets conference room it up!   Heres the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
  Sure Im a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
 Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
  OK, great.
  Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
  I thought we agreed that we wouldnt do things like this.
 Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
  And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
  OK, Im going back to work.
  OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
  Alright guys, its a work day and you guys work here, so lets go do some work.
   Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
  No, youre not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
  Or maybe hes just stuck in character.
  Both.  Theyre both worse.
  Its going to be alright. Were a good company, well figure this out.  Were not going under.
  Michael, not now.
  Michael, can I... OK, Im just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
  Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
  Caleb!
  Today of all days...
  Ill take it.
  Hey David.
  Oh, OK.
  Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
  OK.
  See ya.
  Nothing yet.
  Well there is some bad news.   There has been another murder.
  Conference room everyone.
  No.
  I think today was a good day to have two managers.  Cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, its not because theyre crazy.  Its because theyre doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
  Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 600.
    Really?
  Yeah, I want to go home.
 Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
 The next year he really stepped things up.
 A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
 Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I cant remember.
 I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
 Mmm.
 God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.
 Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
 But if the company doesnt go under then well finally have all our contacts in one program.
 Could go either way.
 Maybe we should just wait and find out.
 Ok.
 Nah. Might as well do it now.
 Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
 Ok. You shouldnt be telling me that stuff and also shouldnt be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
 I care about them and Im just as much of a boss as Michael.  Whats so funny? Im a co-manager.
 Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
 Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
 Who here heard it from Ryan?
 Yes.
 I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?
 I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
 To be honest, I dont know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
 Oh, well I yell. Youve heard me yell.
 Well, that was apple-picking day and theres no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
 Hey, Ryan. Hows it going?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Simple data entry, though. So theres really only one way to do it.
 You know what?
 I think I know the problem.
 I think you seem distracted.
 But, you know what? I came up with something and I think its really gonna help.
 I am, too. Let me show you.
 I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyones attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
 Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
 Right.
  Youre a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once youre in there. Enjoy it.
 Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
 Wow, what do you put our chances at?
 Hmm, sounds risky.
 Wow, thats not such a bad idea.
 Anything else?
 Hey.  Whats up?
 Did you murder someone?
 I think shes okay.
 Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
 Youre not in it at all, because you cant be employee of the month, youre a manager.
 It would look bad.  Sorry.
 Not much.
  Thanks Dwight.
 Youre creeping me out.  Im gonna go.
 Let me guess, you think you should get it.
 Well, in an ideal world...
 Okay, if its all the same to you, Im just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."
 Thats okay, Ill do it.
 Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know youre all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
 Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
 Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I couldve given it to myself because I didnt even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
 Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously Im not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and well figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
 Dwight?
 No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
 Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
 Okay.
 Guys, this isnt some elaborate scam, okay?
 Okay.  That is me, but I didnt order the cake.
 This is Jim.
 Hey, uh David.
 So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  Its been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
 No.
 I really dont know how it happened, David.
 All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
 Yeah.  Thank you.
 Yes.
 See you.
 See you tomorrow, Dwight.
 Too loud.
 Too, too loud. Too Loud.
 Yeah.
 This is all we have.
 No, its not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
 Why would you start so high?
 Three, two, one!
 No.
 We didnt, because we think itd be better to do it together.
 Pam!
 Yes.
 Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
 Yeah.
 Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
 No, Im not gonna do that.
 I think shes doing a good job.
 Im not gonna go tell Phyllis that she cant be Santa.
 Im trying Phyllis. Youre Santa.
 Thats what I want.
 What would Bob do?
 Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
 Can I just talk to you for a second?
 You cant yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap!
 Yup.
 Michael, its Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
 Great!
 Who wants Phyllis as Santa?
 And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.   Can I get you some punch?
  No.
 Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
 What?
 What?
 Wait wait wait, who said that?
 What?
 Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
 Okay. We havent gone under. Weve been sold and that can mean many different things.
 No, you wont, because hes not picking up his phone.
 Oh my God, David. Thats horrible.
 Oh my God!
 Co-manager, actually.
 Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
 Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 1120.
 Well, now we wont get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
 Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. Thats weird.
 But if not, theres always the army. The infantry.
  So youve been shown a nonsensical video. Youre probably wondering, "Whats going on?" Well, youre not alone.
  Ok, this is officially the cutest thing Ive ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
 Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
 I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
 I dont know. I dont know.
 I dont know, I dont know.
 Jerry.
 This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
 No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasnt like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didnt focus on anything in particular.
 Do it.
 We should just go. Hes really uncomfortable.
 What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
 All right.
 There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
 Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, were kind of planners. But were also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
 What?
 Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
 No.
 Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a childrens toilet? Why didnt you just lock the door, man?
 Anybody could have walked in.
 Whoa, whoa.
 Ill take over. Um, what were doing here Michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
 Alright.
 No.
 I dont think so.
 I... Why would you just say something like that?
 Do you even know what that means?
 Um...
 This is way more than I make now.
 I dont think Im gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say theyre not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think Im definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
 Hey, you got a second?
 Actually, yeah.
 Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
 Yeah!
 Really.
 No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
 Why would you do that?
 Mm!
  You gotta do something, man. You cant just sit there.
 What is that?
 Oh. Im fine. Thank you, though.
 Why would I wanna do that?
 For now, Im just gonna go back to work here...
 Yeah. Thank you.
 Hey.
 Well, the grass is always greener.
 Well, its what you wanted.
 For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, Im not really sure what we do.
 Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they couldve just gone and talked to her.
 Thats it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
  Michaels saying hes better at being manager, and I agree, cause hes a better people person, weirdly.
 Alright.
 Yep.
   Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  Im excited.  Oh, definitely.
  Yeah, were slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
  Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if its crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless its a boy.
  Michael.
  Michael, you shouldnt have done that.
  Hmm, that logics air-tight, but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
  Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
    Thats seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
  Are you serious?  Pam.
  I...  Pam, please.
  Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
  So, the plan was seven minutes.  But were calling an audible, because thats her call.  Because shes the quarterback.  Im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
  Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
  Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, thats a big deal.  While were on the subject, why dont I just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check?
  You know, its getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet.
   Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals.
    Oh!  Oh, alright.  Thats a good one.
  Okay, you know what?  Im going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  Hed probably know...
  Alright.
  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, lets go to the hospital.  Pam, lets go to the hospital right now.
  Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
  Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
  No, I dont.
  Oh, and by the way, hate that youre helping her with this right now.  Totally.
  I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously shes gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that Im crazy.  But Im not crazy, shes crazy.  Im not crazy, shes crazy.    Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
    Hey.
  Ah, you know me too well.
  Yeah?  ...  Oh.
  Did you say "she?"
  Mad?  How could I be mad?  Were having a little girl.
  Wow, were having a little girl.  Oh, man.
  Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
  Yeah.
  Alright...  Hey, did you change?
  Oh.  Oh...
  Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
  Lets give it a shot.
  Hey, come on.  Lets go to the hospital.
  Pam, Pam, its time.  Lets go to the hospital.
  Come on, Michael says we should go now.
  Pam.
  You know what?  Lets go.  We got to go to the hospital.
  Hey, are you kidding me?
  If anyone can do this, you can do this.
  Pam, Im scared.  Im real scared.
  The best news is, were going to have a baby today.
  A really awesome baby.
  So lets have it at the hospital.
  How are we doing on contractions?
  Two minutes...
  Michael, I told you.
  No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
  We waited too long!  Two minutes doesnt do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
  Alright, were driving ourselves, actually.
  Alright, I have my wallet.
  Go bags in the car...  Keys, my keys, wheres my keys?
  Okay, I cant find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found em.  Theyre here.
  Okay, Michael!  Focus!
  Alright, here we go!  Youre doing great!  Shell be here soon.
  Michael, come on!
  Okay.
  Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  Well be fine.
  Okay, so what do you want to do?
  Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  Were going to the hospital now.
  Wait, you alright?
  Michael, just go park the car.
  Pams doing great.  Uh, shes ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And shes also fully faced.  Which I dont know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  Its only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
  Okay.
    Doing great, push again.
  No, dont push.  Pull.  Pull.
  Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, shes so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
  No, lets let her rest.  Im sure theres still twelve on each.
  Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
  Shes seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
  Hey, grandmas back.
  Great.
  Oh.  Let me get it.
  I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
  Ready?
  Its so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
  We were just kids.  What did we know?
  Great.
  I think well be okay.
  Ready?  One, two, three...
  I cant.  Shes too strong.  Shes, careful, though.  You dont want to break it.
  I got it.  Alright.
  Nurse!
  How you doing?
  Really?
  Well, youre pushing the milk out, right?
  Wasnt it...  Its kinda like a...  Like that.
  I think youre good.  Doing a good job.
  Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
  Alright.
  Its going to be alright.
  Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
  Oh, hi.
  Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
  You see that?  Im pretty sure shes...  Hi.
  Yup.  Really great.  Whens she available?
  Are you sure it doesnt hurt?
  Yup.
  Yeah.
  Perfect.
  I think she will.
  Well figure it out.
  Thank you.
  Please do.
  What?
  Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
  No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
  Okay, Ill just go get the other guy.
  Hmm?
  Okay.  Sshh.  I know.
  Thats amazing.
  Thats awesome.
  thats great.
  Mm-hmm.
  Hey.
  What?
  Okay, okay.
  Perfect.
  Ha ha ha.
  We definitely are.  At 300, right?  You said we could stay until 300?
  Half hour.
  Yes, car seats right there.
  Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
  Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I dont...  I dont think she heard me.
  Are you really sure we should be leaving?
  But you hear the baby crying, right?
  Uh, its in the lot.
  Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
  Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
  You used my move, didnt you?
 Oh, thank you!
 Hey...
 What do we got here?
 Of course.
 Hm hm.
 Okay.  Just gotta...
 Morning!
 No.
 No.
 No-no-no-no-no.
  Is this yours or mine?
 Good Lord!  I cant believe Im missing this.
 Okay. Love you. Well talk soon.
 It is. Big time.
 Pretty amazing.
 Oh its tough being here for a lot of reasons.
 Is that what happened to you?
 Thats a common mistake.
 And Im actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
 What?
  Right.
 Yeah thats great. Great.
  Whens the last time you upgraded your printer?
  Please stop that!
 Can you grow up?
  Whether its this time or next time.
  Yeah.
 No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
 You know, can I call you back?
 That would be great, thank you.
  No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
 I am not surprised that Dwights using my baby to steal my desk. Im a little surprised that its working.
 Hey Jo, its Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 730 with a very important client. And its so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
 You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
 Okay.
  Thanks again by the way.
 Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you.
 Oh!
 No, its not. They call it Quad-Desk.
 Oh my God. Were going to have to re-name it then arent we?
 No.
 Is he you?
 Where did you take that?
 Oh my God, thats right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
 Sure. That they should do one.
 Whos that?
 John Dillinger.
 Captain Crunch.
 At the Yankees game. Yeah.
 I had a little better reason to believe that... Youre right. Youre right. Well, youre not right, because Johnny Depp...
 ...in your condo complex.
 M. Night Shulman?
 Oh, sorry, wait one second.
 This is actually a big potential sale, so...
 You writing your name over there?
 Thats good. You know, with the kid.
 Alright, here we go.  Michael...
 Michael -  Great.
 Whatd you get?
 Alright!
 Hey.
 So Im going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-ones going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
 Alright. So why dont you just give me my share of the leads, and Ill start making some calls?
 Hey, alright.
 Ahh, these arent leads. What are they?
 I dont think you understand -
  This ones a map.
 I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
 Oh my god, I couldnt envy you more.
 Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - thats just unfair.
 How about this one - When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.
 I love you.
 Michaels stupid scavenger hunt.
  Lincoln.
  It involves you too.
 Phew! Cant wait for this day to be over.
 Just all the - drama.
 Between the - us and you guys. Its unnecessary, right?
 Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
 I have new baby pictures.
 Shes wearing a onesie
 Didnt we kind of start it?
 Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
  I dont think we need opposed.
 Ill text Pam. Shes really good at this stuff.
 Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
 Alright. Then were back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, Im for it.
 No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody!
 No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is really sorry.
 Yes! We do.  Eclairs.
 - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
I made a sale.
19.  I had a really hard work out this morning.
Wow.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pams at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Good one.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
I did not see this coming.
Okay.
Why?
Youve been gone for a long time.
Easy.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Would you like to be our fourth?
All right.
So what do you think?
About Julie?
Yeah.
So you like her?
So Pam was right?
About you two hitting it off.
Hey, youre supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
You want to just make a run for it?
What is happening?
Michael, you dont have to do this.
 Wow. Maybe we should tell her that hes not normally like this.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
It stopped.
All right.
See ya. Nice girl.
You all right?
Actually, you didnt.
 I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
 Whats up?
 Dwight, dont be gross.
 Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."
 "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasnt been on in many cookies."
 I think you need to go a little easy. You cant just suspend someone form work.
 And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
 Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
 Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
 All right, so Ill finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
 Yeah, or maybe we dont even need that.
  Thats a good point.
 Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
  I dont even know who you are anymore.
 Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, Im Jim.
 How are you?
 All right.
  So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So its a tradeoff.
 Hold on one second.
 What?
 None of this is time sensitive.
 No.
 Well, maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work.
 Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
 What?
 What was that?
 Pam, you know hes not gonna get anywhere, and hes gonna blow our sale.
 Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
 Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we dont have a lot of flexibility.
 Yeah.
 Whats that?
 I dont... I dont think so.
 What if shes just flirting with you to get a better price?
 She does not like him.
 cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
 Well, the joke was on you.
 It is totally insane.
 Nobodys for.
 Okay.
 What?
 Wait.
 Michael. Michael.
 Michael.
 No.
 What?
 Stop what?
  Yeah. Thats what were doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
 Yup. Thats exactly what we did.
 Its a pen.
 You do?
 But you didnt believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
 Thats interesting. Wow, its a little early for ice cream, dont you think?
 Oh, my God
 You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
 Michael, no...
 You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now.
  What?
 Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
  Nice effort.
  Thats... not okay.
  Stanley, please, this is serious!
  So were gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
  Exactly. It happened in Big.
  Im really too tired to do this.
  Then lets just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
  We can order in from Hooters.
  Billy Joel Rock Band.
  Now youre just being hurtful.
  Pam.
  Yeah, well its really warm in here. Its like a sleeping bag.
  Sorry about that.
  Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
  Excellent. Go for it.
  Right? So, uh, lets uh...
  Now, were those for the team?
  Ah.
   What about an energy drink or something?
  Well, it doesnt mean I cant drink it.
  A place?
  Okay.
 So instead of working, you want...
 Okay.
 What was you? You were the leak?
 Uh-huh.
 Whyd you do that?
 Yeah.
 Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
 This is a very good idea. This is good. Lets get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
 Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we dont definitely know it was Andy.
 Really?
 I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, thats the point.
 Hey, listen man, you cant take it personally.
 No... sport.
 Hey, Dwight, I dont know if you heard, but were supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
 Wow, thats a lot of keys.
 Thats right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
 I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldnt know for sure cause I dont have a trained ear. Thats why I have to use one of these.
 Yep. Wait, and this.
 Go get em.
 What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
 Oh, no. Dont worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
 Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
 Oh, man, so many points being made.
 But youre comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
 You really think you can make it up to me with food?
 Yep. Thats exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I dont own an Ebay store," so...
 You follow him on Twitter?
 Pam?
 I did not do this.
 This is impressive.
 Do they call you that?
 Come on, give me your hand. Ill help you down.
 Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
 Great.
 Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
  Is there really?
  Aaah!
  Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
  Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
  These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
  Dont beat yourself up.
  Who will be watching the children?
  Prove it.
  Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
  But Ill tell you this, if this works out, I think were looking real good.
  Did something happen Dwight?
  Pam?
  Everything is going to be ok.
  Youre good... youre good at sales.
  Ok, Dwight. We cant do that. So why dont you just tell us what happened?
  Ok.
  Wait, wait, wait. Thats actually a really good idea Kelly.
  Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
  Alright.
  No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
  Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
  No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
  Agreed.
  We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
  Wish us luck!
  Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
  Wait a second. You know you cant buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But Im saying right now, we cant do that.
  Thats it.
  Stop, stop, stop.
  Did you just say you remember him?
  What does that mean?
  Lets just go.
  There it is. Alright.
  Thats pretty good.
 Yes!
 Its my own fault-
 Really?
 For a lot of reasons.
 You should actually thank Erin, shes the one who agreed to babysit.
 Everythings fine.
 We can relax. Lets get our Sweeney on.
 Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
 Oh, my God.
 Okay, this was pretty simple-
  Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
 Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
 No, were good. Thank you, though.
 Alright, well, were never leaving the house again.
  Its like The Hurt Locker!
 No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasnt a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
 We could put that in orange juice.
 Yeah?
 Yeah!
 That was like, ten years ago.
 Nope, its because its genitalia.
 Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
 Good!
 Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
 Just steer more now.
 No! No!
 Amazing. How do I look?
 Well, I do the best with what Ive got. Lets go.
 Hes not the Steve Nash. Hes big though. Hes kind of like...Scrantons Steve Nash.
 Im not doing that. Im just explaining.
 Phoenix Suns point guard?
 No? Nothin?
 Well, Im neither of those things, so...
 Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...
 Well, by worst, you mean the best.
 So, the situation is the worst.
 No, he didnt.
 Tell em.
 What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
 Yeah, I thought you started it.
 Ahhh.
 Okay, great-
 -Im just gonna watch.
  How are ya?
 Dwight!
 Hey, its Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
 Listen, you gotta get over here, cause were pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
 Yes.
 The big gun thing.  Stop!
 No, thats him.
 Nope, not doing that.
 Showtime!
 No, I didnt.
 Is that your office?
 A what?
 I think you mean The Sting.
 Nope. Different movie.
 Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...thats it. Thats really all we were looking for.
 Meredith Van Helsing?
 Okay. But what is he more famous for?
 You know this isnt real TV, right?
 Okay, hes not that good-looking. I dont understand why everybodys obsessed with this-
 We gotta get someone else in there right now.
 Youre an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
 What do you mean?
 Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Heres the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
 So youre taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
 Yes.
 Exactly. You can do this.
 Stop it! Its gonna be great.
 And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
 Who else we got?
 Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
 No, no, no, no...
 No, no, no, no.
 Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
 You hired him?
 Did ya?
 Im just kidding. She told me about it.
 Oh.
 Dwight, please.
 Hey, crazy, um...so...thats it? Youre just-youre fine?
 I dont know.  Oh! Thats... not... yours.
 Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didnt seem to realize that it wasnt his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he wont notice?
 Stop.
 Sounds like someones really trying to convince us that hes not the Scranton Strangler.
  I am Popeye!
 Ive never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number  ...no.
 So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
 Thats right.
 Yikes.
 Oh, no.
 No. No, Im not gonna-no.
 I dont care.
 Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
 That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
 Its not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I dont know about?
 Oooh! You cant handle the truth!
 We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
 Hey.
 When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you dont work hard. Oh, heres something. Uh, why didnt you ever call Pam back?
 Yeah. I mean, Im not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, Im just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
 Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
 Nope.
 Just tell her the real reason.
 Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
 Hey, man.
 To be honest, I still cant believe he didnt call her back. Who doesnt call a dork like that back?
  Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.
 Stop.
 Elaborate.
 So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
  Youre welcome.
 Big day.
 Nope.
 It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
  Ok, your turn.
 Right now?
 Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? Were gonna take a little field trip.
  Okay. Okay. Theres my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. Whats that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
 What?
 Yes.
 This is happening.
 No. Theres no extra outfit in the bag.
 I did... say that.
 Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
 Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The Halberts are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."
 Hey.
 Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
 Yeah.
 Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
 Okay, well, you know what? Everybodys hungry.  Sorry. I think Im just hungry.
 Scones.
 I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
 All right. And cider.
 Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Dont worry. Shes asleep. Im just gonna track down some more chairs.
  Uh, MeeMaw, wheres Cece?
 Okay.
 Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
 I dont know, dad. I dont know.
 I dont know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
 A small blonde woman?
 Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
  Hi.
  Hi.  All right. Travel safe, Angela.
 Whats that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, dont, because Ive got my eye on you.
 Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
 Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jacksons funeral. Things that if you didnt see them live, you wouldnt really care that you didnt see them at all.
  Okay?
 You play?
 You cant even do that.
||
 Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
 Okay...
  Hey.
 I dont know about, love...
 Well I think enemys a strong word. Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
 I dont think thats gonna...
 What kind of pizza would you like?
 Thats not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
 Okay...
 You need to stop talking.
  Okay...
 Im going home, and Im taking my baby with me.
 Im not gonna-
 Uh, its saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? Cause otherwise we cant do any work.
 Nope.
 No.
 Okay, Im not doing every number.
 Why dont we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? Whats the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
 Im trying everything.
 Thats--  the password. Were in.
  All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right.  Whoo!
 I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Lets be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything.
 Mm-Kay, Well, it cant be zero, Kev.
 What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
 A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
 Nope.
 Okay.
 Well, since I have no incentive to sell, Ive cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
 Pam. Okay, now Ive tried everything.
 No.
 Yeah, its not as fun if Im not blowing off work.
||
  Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
 Talk to me.
||
||
  All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again.  Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
 Why?
  Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
 Oh, dont worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
 Well, A for effort right?
 Which is you.
 I disagree with.
 Okay, someone look it up.
 Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
 Oh God, Ive been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
 Oh wow, these are nice.
 Yeah, yeah. Totally.
 Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. Weve got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
 Around here, Oscar is known as actually because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
 Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
 No.
 Hes trying to set you up Michael. Whats going to happen is hes going to try and bring up what ever youre talking about in a very casual way, but secretly hell be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Havent you noticed that I dont bring up the Tour de France around him?
 No politics?
 Two for two, keep it up.
 What do you know about boobs?
 Thank you.
 Show him how to use it.
 Its still on a bike path though right?
 What does that mean?
 What?
 But you didnt fail.
 And you didnt fail those things either.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
 One Charlies Angels. One. Lets go.
 You gotta be kidding me. Who isnt jumping?
 Whys it smell real?  Ah... good one.
 Hey, its snowing.
  Hey, Dwight.
 Well, its not a snowball, cause its only a dusting. Right?
 Youve got something on your nose.
 No.
 You got it.
 Hey.
 We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
 Me neither. Whew.
||
||
 Stop! Stop!
 Oh... oh!
 Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing em until he exhausted himself. And, uh,  then...  "How bout icing it? lol. Dwight."
 Okay... Hollys back.
 Aww...
 Dont. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
 Stop!
 Okay. Okay. Okay.
 Seriously!
 Okay. Okay.
 I just want it to stop.
 Hey, Toby.
 No way.
 Thats increadible.
 You know whats crazy?
 I cant reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.  Excuse me.
 What are you talking about? Youre the one terrorizing me.
 Okay, Im sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
 Yikes.
 No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
  "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese."  Damn it, Dwight!
 Well, uh... I dont think any of us really know. Alright.
 Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
 You like it?
 Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldnt make that.
 Alright, my turn.
 Right. Of course.  "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! Thats my bike. Thats my desk. And that is my daughter.
 I mean...
 I surrender.
 Anything. You got it.
 Youre a psychopath.
 I dont want to go.
 Have you ever seen em do that?
 No, its, its okay. Okay.
 Okay. This is it.
 Go! Go! Go!
 Oh.
 Im actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
 Im just looking for my phone, so... pretend Im not here.
 Sounds good.
 Smart.
 Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
 Was it?
  Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
 Listen, this isnt a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
 Wow.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, Im really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I cant be apart of this seminar.
 I know.
 Im really sorry. I cant do it.
 Will you let me know when this whole seminar things over?
 I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
 Hey.
  I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I dont think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
 Psst. You think this things gonna go much longer?
 Ohh! Good-bye.
 Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
 I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
 Was in the green group.
 And thats what I told him.
 "My mom thinks youre too dumb to hang out with."
 Yeah, woah.  Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
 Hey.
 Pretty good.
 It has been, yeah.
 Sales.
||
 Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
 All right, good catch-up.
 See ya.
 All right. Bye.
 Lets Go!
 Hes going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
 Thats it? Thats all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
 Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
 Whered I put what?
 Oh, sorry gotta go.
 Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, youre really getting warmer.
 Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
 And the final clue...
 You know what, just think about it, youll be fine.
 Cheer up. We made a sale.
 Well, Im going the speed limit. So...
 Someones in a bad mood.
 Alright, let me turn on some music.
 No you dont.
 Alright. Well well be there in ten minutes.
 Alright, Well if I see a gas station, Ill pull over.
 Hello?
 Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
 Ok...
 What?
 Oh my God.
 Just stay there. Ill be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. Hes coming out but I have to go because its an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
 Hey its me. So uh, dont worry. Everythings ok.
 Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Youre not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
 Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
 No no no its ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. Shes laughing and shes happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
 Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So heres the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
 And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
 Nope.
 Ok. Bye.
  There you go. Thanks.
 Big tip.
 What?
 We decided to have a Valentines day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentines day dinner thing. Its a whole thing.
 Shh.
 Um, bottomless champagne.
 No.
  All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.
  Wait.
 Aww, nuts.
 OOH! Boom! Face!
 Did it!
 Love it. Keep it goin.
 Mm-hmm.
  Ew.
 Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so hes not here.
 Definitely not. Thats disgusting.
 Hey, you dont have to...
 That was really rough.
 No, because the office isnt what Id consider a romantic place.
 And a shower.
 What?
 No. We took a walk.
 Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
 Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
 I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
  Sorry.
 Im sorry, Im really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
  Thats fine, its great!
 Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
 Three months.
 Four months.
 Eight months?
  Eleven months.
 Okay now really think hard about this one  One year.
  Four hundred and ninety-four months?
 Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. Thats just...
  Why is Packer back?
 What!?
 You did approve it?
  Can I do something for ya?
 Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
 Do I have any say in this?!
 Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
  Why are you nodding?
 Well, I mean he humped Michael.
 Yeah.
||
 Thats a lot of reasons!
  Can I talk to you a second?
 So, this hot chocolate thing.
 Well, you know you cant actually poison him.
 I really think we should join forces on this one.
 What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
 Here we go.
 Youve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he cant get to them.
 Okay! Well this isnt my best, but call Froggy101, say that were the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and were giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and its his own number.
 He... Its a crime fighting beaver.
 Absolutely, Ill e-mail you a hundred.
 Yeah I couldnt cut it down.
 One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
  Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jos a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what youre gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.
 It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jos kept her eye on you!
  Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
  All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!
 Hes a jerk.
 Wait! Why dont we come up with a plan were all happy about?
 Oh, yikes.
 How did those get out? Im sorry.
 I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and hes selling these. Dwight hes telling me things about myself that theres no way he could have known.
 Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
 Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfields Miracle Legumes.
  Im really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
 Theyre legumes Dwight, and youre just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now.
 Shes amazing. This is very exciting.
 Thats a guarantee.
 Dont think you need the corpse then.
 At a gas station.
 Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
 Totally reasonable.
 Cause its a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
 Yeah... it.s scary.
 Not bad right.
  Nice.
 Oh my God.
 It is right. I mean, its impossible.
 Theyre probably worthless.
 Leave the telescope.
 Holly, will you marry me?
 Congratulations!
 Wait, what?
  We made that.
 Yeah, they dont ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
 Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them da-das.
 And what happens here is-
 We were... I think she was just trying to-
 Wait, so, you dont go into shock or die or anything?
 Listen, youre the one who decided to leave. Come on, hes the new boss, you know we have to do this.
 Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
 Thank you very much.
 Were back in! Right?
 Yep, okay...
 Okay.
 No she doesnt wa- Shes not here.
 Stay in bed!
 Having a great time.
 Thanks, yeah.
 Why dont you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
  I just dont understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
 Whos gonna see us?
 Get in the car?
 I think Im gonna go.
 I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!
 Im sorry, that just wasnt interesting to me.
||
 Nope, go back to the script.
 Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if youre watching this at home its way past your bedtime, by the way howd this get televised?
 I dont know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I dont know, I dont know. Thank you!
 Didnt I?
 I gotta go do this.
 I dont know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
 That did. Pretty huge laugh.
 And impressions!
 You gotta play along man.
 So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
  Hey! Its almost your last day, come sit with us.
 You sure?
 Did you break the shredder Kevin?
  Ahh, what happened to you?
 Uhh, shes still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
 Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
  So Ive been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
 What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
 Youre not leaving tomorrow. Youre leaving today right?
 Wow, so thats it huh? Just, four oclock and you are gone for good.
 Absolutely not. Its just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
 You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
 And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.
 Alright.
 Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
  I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
  You got it.
 Hey!
 No he doesnt.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
 Every time theres a silence, your brains like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" .
 Careful.  There is no inner circle.
 There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
 Thats Toys R Us, I think.
  Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant."
 Seriously?
 What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
 Hes good at his job.  And I like working for him.
 And say what?  "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
 Mmm-hmm.
 Hey, you got a second?
 Umm, really, its nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
 If its alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
 I know.   Just the guys.  Well, maybe thats, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
 Maybe theres a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
 Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
 Oh.  Like nobody.
 It was --
 Thats awesome.
 Hey, whod you end up hiring?
 Oh yeah, did he text us?
 He didnt text me.
  Dont worry, the first days always the hardest.
 Yeah.
 Nope.  Just...  Okay.
 Well, there is no inner...circle.
 So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery .  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
 You know what?  Instead of a game, why dont we do an exhibition?  Id love to see that dunk of yours.
 Today.  Now, maybe.  Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you dont have to mime it.
 Why not?
 Alright, there you go.
 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
 Okay.
 Fantastic.
 Yup.
  Now what?
 Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
 Erin.
 All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?
 Nope. Baskets have it.
 So as it turns out, unless youre a young child or a prison inmate, you dont need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
  Well, I really appreciate the offer, but Im just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I dont want to mess this up, right? Theres a consensus, people are happy.
 Wait...
 Im coming.
 Youd slow me down.
 Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Lets see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mines at 1030, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
 Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
 You define foment.
 Oh, its just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. Its just a club. Guys talking, you know.
 Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.
 And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, its a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.
 Wow, youve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
 And the desk.
 Okay.
 I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
 You cant fire me. Youre acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
 You wouldnt dare.
  If you get promoted, and if you havent fallen in love with me by then.
 If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well thats pretty premature to think," but I always say, its better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
 Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, Im on the spot. I dont know. Um... you know what? I think Im good.
 Nope. When Jos here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
||
 Well, I dont know about that. Just wasnt for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
 Yep.
 Hey, Dwight. Whats up?
 Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? Theres no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.
  He never called a meeting.
   Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
  Really?
   ...What is it?
  You could just be saying it to get the job.
  How about this. Why dont you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
  Okay.
  Did you just trademark that...
  We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branchs new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someones bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, Im not too worried. But Im really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabes last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
  Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
  Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
  Yes.
  Yes.
   He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius.
   Oh.
  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
   So I think all we need is a resume, and well be good right?
  Yeah, its no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool?
  Can I ask why youre leaving your current job?
  Is this a bad time to be doing this?
  Andy? You all set?
  So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
   Is it?
  Your departments just you, right?
  Good!
  Yeah.
  Peepa.
  Great.
  No.
  Youre not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
   Okay. Thats vivid.
  Yikes.
  Well, you know how I like taking bribes.
  Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesnt trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
  Okay.
  Thank you.
  Great.
  Im sure its fine.
  Howard Cline?
   Oh... Deshaun Williams.
  Hes an amazing man. Hes a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
  Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
  Thats very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
  I think thats probably all we need to hear from...
  Thats very...
  You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
  No, not at all. In fact, Im not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, Im just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
  Uh--
  Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
  No, was it good?
   Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here youre French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
  Assistant to the Regional Manager.
  What is it?
  Oh, thats my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldnt hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? Thats a travesty.
   No. No! Wait, but, I mean, youre Dwight, and then... hes the...
   Ohhhh!
  This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."
  Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
  Um... why Kelly?
  Okay.
  Oh, I didnt know you knew her?
  No.
  You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasnt a good fit.
  All right. Name.
  Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know.
  I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
   All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Lets discuss.
  Yes.
  Thank you, Dwight.
  Well, that was quick.
  Hes not a real candidate.
  You took the deal.
  Thats not okay.
  What is happening right now?
  No, why would you think that?
  Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
  No, no, no. Not ever, cause thats not gonna happen.
  Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like Im going a little bit crazy.
  Thank you.
  Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
   I suppose I am.
  Yes.
  Okay.
  Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
  Hey! Hey! Hey!
  What about Darryl? We can all agree that hes a stand-up guy, right?
  What? No, no, its not a vote.
  I dont know. This conversation really got away from me.
  No, they cant. Thats not how this is gonna work.  Were going in this room, were going to have a meeting. Were gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and shes gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there?
 The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.Â  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I dont really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.Â Â  And he chose
 Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
 No, I told you I dont like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
 No one should be planking at all.
 You watching that commercial again?  Why do you keep watching it, if you know its just gonna make you cry?
 Hes got a bank vault. Thats a start.
 The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who hes gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope its not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. Its strange.
  Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.  Okay.  What is this?
 Its, its nothing.
Â  Its just a list of our names, split into two columns.
 Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
 No. Okay. Um, Ill take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
 We dont need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
 I promise you, we dont need a warning-
 Left.
 Why are you- How do you know?
 Uh, no, actually. That was in Roberts notebook.
 Okay, its not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
 I dont think its-
 Thats not it.
 Mmum, still wrong.
 Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!
 Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
 Hey. Its nothing. Alright? Ill text you when we get there. Let you know whats going on.
 Nope. No dog video.
 Okay. See you guys.
 Uhhh, the street?
 Oh, I didnt know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
 Right.
 Yeah, she does like Elmo.
 Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
 Shhh.
 Alright, Im gonna go warm up the car.
 Ryan? A little help?
 Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
 Good. What? Nothin
 I dont think we have to do this again cause its gonna take a whole.
 Come on, man.
 Hey, so this isnt matching up with thisand Im not sure which ones right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
 Alright.
 Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
 Yeah, alright Kev why dont you come with us?
 Does it save time though? â€˜Cause weve been here for about an hour.
 K, Kevin, are you saying â€œSee the worldâ€? or â€œSea World?â€
 No, see? Right there, thats the problem with your method. â€˜Cause I still dont know if youre saying â€œSea Worldâ€ or â€œsee the world,â€ and its taking a lot of time to explain it.
 How many L to a K?
 Ill take five.
 Your ex-wife?
 Wow. Alright. Cant wait to meet her.
 She looks at it when shes on the potty, and she makes the faces.
 We know that.
 You have a walking buddy.
 I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much.  Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
 Ok.
 Andrew.
 No, I didnt notice anything.
 I dont know what to tell you, man.
 Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
 Nah, you definitely werent kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.
 Yeah. Big sale. Dont worry about it though, I dont really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donaldcan you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.
 and Im back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
 Gettin psyched up?
 Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this
 I mean, do you like it? You having fun?  Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun.and you did that.
 But I think its big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea.which, by the way, I cant wait for.
 Absolutely not.
 Pull up your pants.
 Id hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70s theme party, or a 70s theme meeting, or a 70s theme convention...
 1870s...
 Nope, he means tuna dog.
 Do Snowboarders hate animals?
 Dwight! At least aim it.
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
 Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
 So...ah, whos gonna take the dog?
 What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
 Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
 Yeah, thats pretty good.
 Nice job.
 Oh man, its gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
 I mean, I dont even know what Id do with all that money.
 No, Id probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. Id either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
 Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
 Which ideally would be me....
 Stop. Im a barista in your fantasy?
 I dont know about Stephen King, I mean...
 Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
 OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. Thats seventy-five boxes per person, so thats not so bad.
 Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
 Theres gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
 Yeah  Not that theyre not smart people.
 Id go with that.
 Not that, dont...
 Its a great idea Kev, I dont think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
 Our fake winnings
 It is, yeah. I mean I just dont know why Im compromising if its my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy its Maine and you love it.
 Nope. Youre, youre doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.
 A...hot chocolate tea
 Kevin Costner.
 Yeah.
 So, its not the dumbest idea.
 But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
 So sadly, its the best idea on the table.
 Is he OK?
 OK, alright, thats...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
 Thats alright.
 Doesnt matter what the name is. SeÃ±or Loadenstein, thats stupid.
 Thats OK, were good.
 Porque es muy rapido.
 Right. Its city and country combined.
 And I can fish right from the window of Pams pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
  Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
 But what are you gonna do about that?
 Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and were basically there.
 Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
 Dammit Dwight!
 Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
 Ok, I just asked that ques-, I dont know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
 So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright!
 Whoa whoa whoa!
 No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! Youre way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
 Good.
  Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
 Youve seen it, right?
 Theres this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If theres an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, itll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
 Okay, dont be gross.
 Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
  So, weve typed in the address, now lets take a look at the street view.
 Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
 Im actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.  Ive only sold one copy.
 Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
 Oh, hey, how are you doing, Im Jim.
 No.
 No, no, no, no, no. No.
 Chapter 4 â€“ One of the hosts most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
 Chapter 9 â€“ The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
 Closing ceremonies.
 I think I left my wallet in your house.
 Right here.
 Keys, keys...
 I didnt forget them, theyre right here.
 Im so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
 Whoo.
 Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
 Chapter seven The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
 I dont know if I can.
 Alright.
 I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
 No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
 Hey.
 Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
 Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
 Mmhmm. No, but what Im saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
 Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
 Hey its Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because Ive read a lot about this really great documentary.
  Its called Ghostbusters.
 It didnt have a buster sign around him?  Why dont you draw him?  Why dont we see this whole thing.
 I aint fraid of no ghost.  Whoa!
 You know thats
 I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
 Party looks fun doesnt it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
  Are you serious?
 Thats funny.  Ok.
  Thank you.
 Careful, whoa. First of all, its not like I think thats going to help the Eagles win.
 No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. Its not...
 Thank you.
 Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, theres a ghost in my closet." Now, you say one of two things - one, "Youre just having a bad dream," or two, "Lets go see what it was."
 Ok.
 Oh, come on!
 Pink is the red-
 I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
 Oscar, how are you on that side?
 But that would make more sense.
  ...W R K.
 Uh no its W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe thats what you are hearing.
 Im just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derbys in a really good place now. Somy pitch isme, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
 Is that off again?
 Ok.
 Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
 Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
 Dwight, question.
 If this doomsday device goes off...
 If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
 Ok.
 Nope.
 HmmHeda.  No.
 Ok, where is he?
 Ill try both.
 Robert.
 Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
 You up for a game?
 Exactly. Here we go. Lets do it.
 Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
 In the box.
  Is that my phone?
 Nah, I think its mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
 Oh, oh yeah.
 Yes. Right now? Yes.
 Here you go.
 Awww, sorry. Did it break?
 You sure?
 What kinda iPhone is that?
 Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
 Ha ha. No, I dont. No, I dont. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-
  Ah! Classic, right?
 Im alright.
 Yep.
 Yep. Ah. Oh.
 Yeah. That does not feel good.
 Ok, he didnt fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
 I wasnt here that day.
 No- Ok. Well, well talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
 Ok, this is crazy.
 I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I dont do that, I think Ill be alright.
  Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
 No? Come on.
 Well, that is... because you didnt realize that... I was left-handed.
 Hmm. Doubt it.
 Whats that?
 Honestly I have no idea. I just figured wed save her from Ryan right?
 Hey.
 Yeah. Super pretty.
 The temp?
 Nope.
 And Im telling you, I dont.
 No, I dont.
 No, Im not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like Im not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. Its true, but it doesnt help anybody.
 Okay. Uh, I dont. So are we good?
 Oh, I stand corrected.
 Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
 Mm-hmm.
 Not his moms car.
 Touche?
 Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think Im in the clear. If that wasnt for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, hes a really nice guy.
 Dwight!
 Dwight! Dwight!
  Sorry about that.
 Dwight!  Why?
 Leave.
 Mm-hmm?
  Told you.
 You okay?
 Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
 Stop shoving me.
  Really?
 Si.
 Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first.
 Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
 No, Im not worried. Because this lie isnt for me, its for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I havent had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
 No.
 I am not lying.
 Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
 Yeah, but I dont smoke.
 I dont know.
 Okay, easy. Trust me, Im around for the long-haul.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Oh okay, shes going into labor. Make way, everybody!
 Okay.
 Oh my God!
 Okay guys, here we go! Well see you!
 How do you feel?
 Cool. Thanks.
 Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
 No, of course were not tourists. Were just people that arent from here who are taking a tour.
 By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
 Yeah, thats what I had for breakfast and I think thats probably why Im still hungry.
 Only two hundred dollars?
 Oh wow.  So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
 Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come.  I think theyre just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
 What are you talking about?
 Andy â€“ this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  Its just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And youre our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You dont have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head.  Im wearing a very pink hat.  Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure â€œDM does GBâ€ means something kinda sexual.  But guess whos wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  Thats huge.
 Theyre terrible.
 Tuna?
 And to drink?
 Oh-ho, I am in.
 Im excited, Ive actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But Im older now, I can outrun a zombie.
 Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
 Its locked.
 Thats weird, if its not locked, why isnt it opening?
 Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. Im gonna find him.
 We didnt have one scheduled.
 Hey guys lets just all admit it. Ok? Dwights better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And hes never, ever going to go back on it right?
  What are you up to? Oops look out!
 Prank!
 You know what its not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
 Because youre sitting?
 Ok.
 Because youre sitting?
 You know I have to do this.
 I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
 I dont know. He wasnt talking to me. But if I were you I wouldnt hire his wife.
 Well its sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
 Well its not that easy. Its kind of sometimes difficult.
 No, I dont think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what its doing.
 Oh, wow. So cute.
 Very cute.
  Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay.
  Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Creed. I was never here, all right?
 Oh boy.
 Do I?
  I know, I do.
 I really wish I could help. Im not really sure how I can...
 Thats the thing. See, I didnt want to get in the middle of this. Still dont. But heres something I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
 Perfect!
 Yes?
  I dont know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why Im here. And between us, shes on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I dont know how this helps, but its just what Im thinking.
 Yes. All right. Great.
 This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. Im not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanleys tie is really the story of the day...
 Ok, so thats a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. Its pretty smart, right?  Hi, how you doing? Im Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
 You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, Ill just be in, you know.
 I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
 Shes not your grandmother, is she?
 Yeah.
 It wasnt me.
 Kathy wants to leave our clump?
 Ow, What are you doing?
 Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
 What was that?
 Cant do that.
 Ah... Im gonna s-
 Dwight really wants my bonus. Hes trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I cant drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
  Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh its uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
 So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
 I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
 Hmm...
 Nice try, this is ridiculous.
 Three times.
 Andy, youve gotta be kidding me.
 OK, you know what? Why dont we just call animal control...
  Yes, Im calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
 Uh, I dont know, let me ask.  Uh, were you quilled?
 And whats its name?
 Oops.
 Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
 Yes. It is.
 I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
 I dont-
 Yeah.
 O...K.
 Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldnt have got you involved because the truth is, I dont even really care about this picture, its a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
 Right. Youre right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
 Ill figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
 You alright, Santa?
 Yes.
 Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
 OK.
 Alright. I will definitely do that.
 You know what? Youre sitting, and thinking, and its probably better if it comes from me anyway.
 Yes. They totally do.
 Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......Cmon, Jim.  I got nothin.
 Cathy wants to leave our clump?
 Sorry it didnt work out. Hope you find what youre looking for.
 Thats ok.
 Thatd be great, thank you.
 You can write a book about chairs.
 Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that dont know what paper is.
 Stop right there. I love it.
 In Philadelphia.
 Thats a great idea.
 Yeah.
 All right, good stuff.
 I thought it was a fun idea.
 Okay.
 Theres a table over here.
 Shawn Marion.
 Wrong, for so many reasons.
 Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
  All right.
 Andy, its the last day of the quarter. Weve already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
 Andy, were gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
 Its always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that shes out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, Ive found out what he likes. And its really weird.
 I know.
  Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
 You know, theres a glare from over here... oh wow, thats magnificent.
 Im sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
 I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
 Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
 DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
 Youre looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I dont mean to brag, but New Years Eve, I was home by nine.
 Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
 I bet I should.  Thats beautiful, Im going to email that to you.
 All right-
 I must...
 Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This nights been magical.
 Really? Why?
 Good night.
 To both these bears.
 To madness.
 Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
 Are you serious?
 And theres my talking point.
 To the shame room!
 Hey.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 It was pretty uneventful, actually.
 Uh, hit and run.
 Nope. Not guilty.
 Were best friends, actually. Were going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
 Okay.
 I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didnt think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
 Aw man, I would but I cant miss any more work.
 Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
 Wow, Im really sorry.
 I never considered that my week off would make everyone elses job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
  So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
 Oh man, Ernestos. That was our favorite restaurant too.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay, wait, wait.
 No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasnt listening to you.
 ...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesnt matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
 Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
 No.
 No.
 Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
 Uh-
 The empanada guy!
 Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
 Because my car broke down.
 Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
 Okay, listen, all right? Dwights on to us, hes going to figure it out really soon, so lets just get ahead of it, lets tell the truth.
 Uh, excuse me, can I have everyones attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that Im really sorry, I didnt know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think youre going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
 Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
 Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
  You want a giraffe?
 Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
 Whoa, no, no. Thats overdoing it, I think.
 Split the difference?
 Okay, lets go.
 What?
 Wow, what a surprise. Thats crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
 Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
 That was a great idea.
 Oh my goodness, lets take a look at these. Theyre usually amazing, so lets see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
 Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
 You know what? I dont think you need to do things on command. Thats very weird. Ill just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
 I dont know what else we can do here.
 Its okay.
 All right, all right. Okay.
 All right, I know, I know. Lets just get this.
  I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
 Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
 Cece!
 Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, were going home, were going home. Were going home, were going home. I know, I know, bud.
 I know, I know.
 Im gonna grab her, okay.
 Hi, all right. Im just going to go down to the car and Im going to put her in her seat and Ill be right back up.
 No, no, its okay, Ill be right back.
 Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Lets go.
 I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if thats not happening, Im not averse to just buying them all off.
 Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but its always buried behind like a ton of black licorice?  Bought it all. Now its like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
 Uh, I cant get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I cant...
  Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right?
 Its not really food, right?
 Ok, ok, ok.
 â€œAnd shove it up my butt.â€
 Im not gonna eat it.
 Im not-
  They hate me, Pam.
 No, its bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
 Its a lunch thing.
 I feel like a stranger in my own country.
 Ok. Well, hey, youre not here. You dont know, Ok? Its intense. They made me eat black licorice.
 Oh ho! Look whos back reporting for duty.
 Nope. Its over.
 Nope. OK.
 Ooh, me three.
 I just got a text from Robert California that says â€œbring your clubs to Floridaâ€.
 I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks?
 â€œRobert, Hey!â€ Exclamation point.
 â€œGot your text, awesome idea. Lets hit the links next time youre in PAâ€ Dash JH.
 Yeah, its a golf text.
 Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
  Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
 Ok, sending.
 Really did  He responded L-O-L.
 Now, is it too dark to say that Cicis having an operation?
 I think youre right.
 Total nightmare.
 Yeah, thats what Im saying. Theyre incredibly helpful, youre lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably wont even know Im gone.
 You know Dwight, if you didnt want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldnt go.
 Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.
 Essential.
 Alright, Im gonna pack my trunks.
 Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think thats gonna make us roomates.
 Hey, quick question Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when youre showering. Save some water.
 Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
 Mosquito.
 So, what is this special project?
 That sounds awesome.
 Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
 Bye.
 I will.
 I am on the two kid sleep schedule so Im up and at em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didnt know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-
 Puppet.
  Yeah. Its weird being away from them. Never done this before.
 Are you sure its stress? Because I did poison you.
 Oh no, Im serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. Ill poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
 Thats a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
 Yes.
 Loggins and Messina.
 Man.
 Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
 I would love to hear the other mottos.
 No way.
 It was-
 You got to stop with the antacids. Its not the antidote.
 Okay.
 True loves kiss.
 Dwight, I didnt poison you. I was kidding.
 Wow. Are you that bored?
 Is that another motto?
 Mmm.
 Ah, lets do it.  Oh, thats healthy.
 Ive spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, dont end up like Stanley," and now Im wondering if I even have what it takes.
 Oh, I dont know.
 All right, what the heck? Lets do it.
 Dwight, why dont we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
 No ones moving!
 Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
 The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Floridas pretty loose with the death penalty.
 Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
 You havent done any of the research.
 Stanley, are you listening to music?
 You are bleeding through your shirt.
 Catching butterflies.
 Theater.
 Dragging.
 Dragging sticks.
 Talla-nasty, very clever.
 Cathy? Its been great. Fun, normal.  I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but hes turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
 How many buttons do you have?
 College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
  Im sorry, I thought youd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
 In the bed.
 Brown, shiny, painful bite.
 Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
 So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 Ow.
 Just check it.
 Alright.
 He knows what hes doing.
 Alright, then I will catch you later What do we do now?
 Oh.
 Hmm? No.
 Okay alright.  Im really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. Im-Im married. Im very happily married.
 um I mean-
 Im sorry, I feel like maybe Im-Im I misread things. Okay, lets just go back to watching.
 Yes, I can.  uh, all right. Im really sorry. I think well just well just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I dont care.
||
 All right. Now I think its time for you to go.
 Cathy, go.
 Oh yeah? Whats the first best?
  Is that Nellie?
 Which Spice Girl?
 Okay.
 Come on, man.
  Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
 Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
 Im very sorry.
 Im really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
 Dwight.
  You can...  You can do it Ryan.
 Youre the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
 I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
 About ten minutes.
 Oops, thats my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
 Its Ryan. â€œIm sorry. I lied. Im not in the bathroom. I cant do it. I need to see my mom. Im going home.â€
 Uh...
 okay.
 Im not doing the Presentation.
 Okay, Ill do it.
 A costume?
 Ive been in here for 20 seconds.
 Im not wearing eyeliner.
 Oh, that reminds me.  Little something from all of us.
 This is the last time Ill ever see Dwight. Its a weird feeling, its, um, whats the word? Its not, its not bittersweet. Its uh... sweet. Yeah.
  All right. So... I guess this is it.
  Goodbye, Dwight.
 Well, hes Floridas problem now.
 Whats that?
 I thought you liked the store?
 Thank you.
 Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
  All right. There he is.
 Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
 Um, actually its, its for your own good. I think maybe we should-
 You know, I just think you should know that-
 Well, I tried.  You saw it, so, its on the record. I have a plane to catch.
 No, no, I think it was more like, you know, I liked him, but I dont anymore because he did a bad job, so Im definitely gonna yell at him.
 I tried. He will not listen.
 Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you havent dealt with him in awhile, all right. Hes like super Dwight. Its like hes been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
 Stanleys very upset that were leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
 OK. All right.
  Dwight.
 OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me.  No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
 Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
 Dwight, hes gonna kill the store.
 And then, Im pretty sure hes gonna fire you for it.
 Yes.
 Dwight, please.
 OK, first of all, theyve mostly worked, so-
 Dwight, come o-
 Gross! Dont lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
 Gross!
 What? What, what, what, what, what?
 Im sorry.
 Im so sorry, I forgot.
 You all right? You ok?
 What are you doing?
 Get up.
 Get up. All right? Im not gonna let you by.
 OK.  What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesnt work.
  What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
 This is dangerous.
 Why?
 Nope. I think that was it.
 Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
 Hey.
 I missed you.
 Wow. Its the end of an era.
 And I was still just a paper salesman.
 Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
 Nellie
 What brings you to town?
 No, thats Andys office.
 Cant you do something about this?
 -Right.
 What is going on? And wheres Andy? And what is going on?
 I think its a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. Its not a name.
 Any luck?
  Andy?
 Andy, where are you?
 What? Youre in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertrams trying to take your job.
 Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
 Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, youre basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
 Dwight, should she be our manager?
 And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
 The raise isnt real.
 Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
 Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
 Land. World. Uh, its not that I dont want a-- well, yes, I guess Id take a raise. Thats not what Im saying. Thats not-- sorry.
 Yes.
 Oh, god, nature, please.
||
 Was that not the--
 Mm-hm.
 Was that it? No, that wasnt bad.
 No. I wouldve said no.
 I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That its okay for someone to just take someone elses job? Shouldnt work like that.
 No, its not, because you dont really work here.
 Yeah, thats the thing. I dont know if you can even give raises.
 Yes.
 No.
 She dies.
 Lets see it. Show of hands.
 All right, guys, stop.
 How?
 Oh, great.  "Glad they didnt mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh thats not good.
 Stanley doesnt have a moustache.
 Okay, the mans worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
 Okay, quick. Who says moustache?
 Who says no moustache?
 Im sorry, were taking work time to move someones personal belongings into their new apartment.
 Why is she here?
 Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? Cause to be honest, I dont think its gonna fit through the door.
 That was one time-
  Excuse me, one second. Hi.
 Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
 Thats moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
 Sounds like every other party.
 Oh! Hire a magician.
 Trust me.
 Yes, you should.
  "Nellie, dont open, stupid. Love, Nellie."
 I doubt that theyre sh-
 Whoa. Who is this guy?
 Boyfriend.
 Like a boyfriend?
 Yeah. Whoa. Heres one with his face whited out.
 Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
 Oh, Nellie. Im so sorry. We were just...
 Shh!
 Dwight!
 Im so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
 No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
  You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Lets give up on all this mean stuff.
 No, thats not what I-
 Absolutely. Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? Its way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
 Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe theres some stuff in her past that you guys dont know about thats a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
 No. No.
 Oh, Ill do it. I will volunteer.
 Ill do it.
  Its the four of hearts.
 Not true. Cause thats not a real place.
 Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
 Night-night.
 Phyllis says the same twelve clichÃ©s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
  Hey, come on.
 And thats noon. Exactly.
 Thats it.
 Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, thats it.
 Sorry, just to be clear, youre saying do NOT shake the baby.
 Thats about it, yeah.
 Um...
 What happened?
 Couple of times.
 Um... I dont... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, wed had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
 I was very drunk.
 Wow, what are we talking about?
 Hey, hey. Okay.
 Well, its good to see Kellys maturing.
 Not at all, can we go?
 Second line.
 "And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green."
 Uh, Ryan can never know.
 Wow Thats terrible, I really liked him.
 Well, I second that emotion.
 Wow! Look at that! It says hes actually playing State College. Thats only three hours away!
 Tickets are 250 bucks.
 Paul Anka.
 Okay, you could just show up late though.
 Well, as long as you dont want to alarm people...
 Wow, thats exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
 Wait, what? Come on!
 Okay, Oscar, Im not saying youre not dreamy, because you are, but isnt it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
 Okay, what was this look?
 What happened, did he do it?
 Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isnt Downton Abbey.
 Heres what Im going to do. Im going to go over there and Im going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
 Boom!
 what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
 Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
 Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
 Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
 Look at that one though, hes smiling!
 Yes--
 Okay well, Andy, listen. Its okay if you dont feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
 Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
 Yeah
 Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Whos the strongest? Well, theres only one way to solve that â€“ flat curl contest.
 All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
 Come on, Gabe, you cant handle his hamstrings. Youre getting hypno-thigh-zed.
 Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
 Youre welcome.
 Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
 All right, easy there, grandpa.
 Okay. You dont need my help?
 All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
 Thanks Janet.
 Wow, simultaneous sale.
 Screw â€˜em.
 Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
 Hey, hey, come on, language.
 In the fridge.
 Sorry, man, I cant focus on zingers. Theres too many potential clients.
 Robert?
 The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
 Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
 Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
 Theres actually not a rule that says that.
 How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
  Hes running!
 Damn it.
 Its a monkey.
 Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
 Is that him?
 What? What am I gonna do? I dont â€“
 Dwight!
 Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
 Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
 Are you sure?
 Brace yourself. 3 2
 1. Here we go!
 You all right?
 Ah!
  Dwight, what are you doing?
 What are you talking about?
 I dont even know where the stairs are!
 God!
 What?
 Big Red Paper Company?
 All right, guys. It didnt work out for any of us, so were still on the same team. Let me get these.
 But youre saying theres a chance.
 Oh, man, Id have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
 Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
 I dont know. Ive always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
 That sounds lovely.
 I know why youre doing this, Dwight.
 Last week, I may have gone too far. Ill explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
 Now hes trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think its fair to be cautious.
 Hows it going, man?
 Great, yeah, good.
 Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
 Pam? No!
 No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwights photo studio slash trap.
 No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
 Nope.
 But are you a hundred percent sure? I dont think any of us are.
 Nope.
 Thats-
 Thats-
 Okay.
 Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
 Alright. Why dont you just-
 -give him to me and... perfect.
 This is great.
 Excuse me.
 Just do it.
 Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
 Lets do it, shoot it.
 Great.
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, so thats it?
 No, no, see? This is what were talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now youre not drunk...
 Oh boy.
 Andy, come on.
 Hey.
 Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
 You are really good at modesty. Shes a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids room. Theres a hippo leading a parade of 500 childrenâ€”
 Oh, yeah
 Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
 In Philly, so, that doesnt really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
 An Altima or better.
 we good?
 No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Merediths face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
 Done. Explain.
 Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
 The new guys called one.
 Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
 You should ask him. Its a color you would never expect.  Too easy.
 You a sports fan?
 Oh. Any team sports?
 Phillies fan, though, right?
 No, like baseball. A baseball team.
 Ok. Good talk.
 I have nothing in common with Plop.
 Oh, come on, Pete! God, thats just sad. If he doesnt watch himself, hes gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
 Yeah. You know what? Ill meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Hey, man. Its halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, dont. Im in. Yeah, yep, Im all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah!
  Spinning would be more fun.
  Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandmas got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roys wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wifes ex-fiancÃ©s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that its your wifes ex-fiancÃ©.
  A banana?
 Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
  Just so weird.
  Is this his house?
 OK.
 Uh, my ex-fiancÃ©.
 I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesnt know. Um actually I did tell Pam and we decided â€˜no. But, then I decided yes anyway. So, Im thinking theres another conversation coming. And, its hard to know when that will be.
  There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
 Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
 That was, that was a surprise.
 Youre welcome.
 By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
 Gravel company?
 Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
 Yeah, you never know.
 OK, Kenny.
 He plays piano?
 Definitely.
 Courtside seats. Sixers.
 It was an away game.
 No.
  Um, ok.
  Oh, heres one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
 You heard that one.
 That I thought we were millionaires.
 Thats all right.
 You all right?
 Ready?
  John Stamos.
  Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And whatd they say? Thats awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
 Its not even real yet. And Im not gonna tell her til its real.
 Im sorry. This is for a news audition?
  I can feel you looking at me.
 Uh-huh.
  That didnt happen. You wouldve told me right away.
 Uh...
 God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
 Dont worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which Ive been wanting to try.
 That was really good, Darryl.
 Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed meâ€”.
 I deserved that.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
I think I got it right here.
 You got it.
 Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first.
 Getting my wife a week off from work.
 Awesome, right?
 Well, I dont know about the rest of you but Im just gonna say it. Im nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.
  â€œSide effects of EMF include headaches...â€
â€..breast pain...â€
 Oof. â€œInfertility.â€
 Ah! Theres my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
 What?
 Thats impossible, cause thats a brand new bag... Oh my god.
 Im gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
 You mean Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. Well be getting a dozen.
 Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
 What?
 What?
 Alright, alright, gang. Lets just settle down. Youre yelling in her face.
 Just...you good?
  Im so sorry for all of this.
 Ill get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
 Pam, Im really sorry. I- Im really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking?
 Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
 Andy!
 Youre the boss. Dont you think wed all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
 What are you talking about? Youre not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
 Next stop Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also.
  So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
 You got it.
 If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
 Hes just mad that were all having fun.
 Hes fine. Hes indestructible.
 Lets go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
 OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
 Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
 Oh no, Im gonna push him. You know why? Because youre getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? Hes trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we wont get there. Is that what we want?!
 What do we want?!
 When do we want it?!
 Thats impossible.  Dwight!
 What are you doing?
 You know hes doing all this on purpose.
 Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
 What?
 Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
 No.
 Ill take it.
 Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
 That doesnt matter.
 Ok...thats not...
 Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, were all kinda like your children?
 Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
 OK. And theyre all dangerously close to not getting pie. And theres only one guy who can save them. Its not me.
 Its pretty good actually.
 We bonded. We got to-
 Dont..
 Dont..
  Pie! Pie! Pie!
 We did it.
 It wont budge.
 Ceces really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
 Its Okay.
 Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses?
 Theres a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
 Gettin a lot of mileage out of this, arent ya?
 Are you sure youre okay with me putting in this much money.
 Youre the best.
 Okay. Ill see you in a little bit.
 Shut up.
 Wow.
 Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
 Oh, I actually talked to my wife and wed really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
 We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in.
 All right.  Awesome. Cool.
 Oh man, it was great. They were great.
 I did, yeah.
 Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
 Ten. It was the full ten.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Yeah. Its a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
 Yeah.
 What is it?
 Um, oh man, I dont actually know.
 They werent really talking that much about money. They just said, Were good with investing and then I...and I...
 No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
 You werent there.
 It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
 Pam.
 Well talk about it later.
 I thought that concert was pretty great.
 Angela, its Halloween. You have to sing â€˜Monster Mash.
 Uh...
 Okay. Well, just forget it.
 Because it is Halloween. So if youre going to sing a concert, its a good idea to throw that one in.
 And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
 Competent.
 Dwight!
 No, you chose yourself.
 Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
  See these forms...
 What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
  Good afternoon!
 Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
 Hi, David.
  Go ahead David, Im listening.
 I cant. I have the thing.
 I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that Im helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time Ive ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
 Yeah, Im here. Are we all on?
  Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
 I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
  Uh yeah. Trust me, Id rather be with you guys.
 Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
   Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
 Im gonna try a different spot. Okay?
 Okay, Ill call you right back.
 What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
 The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
 It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
 Nobody!
 No, no, no.
 Jim Halpert.
 Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
||
 Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But dont worry. Ill figure it out.
 Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
 You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
 What? Yeah, right. As if.
 Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
 I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
  Hey David, how would you like a guy whos not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
 This is gonna be awful.
 I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
 Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while Im gone.
 Yep.
 Oh, great.
 Because were friends.
 Unfair. Whens my birthday?
 How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
 All right.
 You know, truth be told, I think all youll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while Im gone.
 You know, at the end of the day, its really only two days. I mean, Ill be back in the office. Â If you need me for an emergency, call me. Â Ill be there...
 Tell me about it.
 All right. You know what? Â Maybe well just... Well go slow.
 Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
 All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, thats-- thats decorative.
 Still decorative.
 No.
 Dont-- dont-- dont pole people with knives.
 Phyllis! Â Wow.
 Well, were here. Perfect. Â 
 Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
 This is hilarious, but were gonna stop with all--
 Shuckin the peas. Â You should go back to the first part, though. You are Â gonna Â cover for me?
 Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you.
  Im having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
 Well, yeah, but Im wondering if its too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
 I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure Id get in at 500, check into a hotel at about 600 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
 So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you dont know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
 Yes! That, that, that! Were definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
 Done, right?
 Im not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
 Right.
  Were thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
 Whoo!
 Yeah, I think so.
 Uh--
 Best Christmas ever.
 Thank you.
 Cant wait.
 I dont know. Is it what you expected?
 So happy right now.
 Yes, he is finally nigh.
 So hes kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
 Wow! Its my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
 Oh, its like naughty or nice.
 Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
 Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
 But more than once? cause you could have made a mistake.
 Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now youre gonna find out whos--
 Damn.
 Ooh.
  Oh...what was that? Now Im gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh...
 Im probably never gonna see you again.
 Okay, sorry, sorry.
 Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
 Ill call you when I get in.
 All right.
 Love you.
 I think theyre going to the conference finals.
 Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, dont even-...
 I bit my lip at lunch today.
 Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
 Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...
 Whatever. Its not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing thats gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! Thats it, Im going home!
 I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pams face because lets be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
  You sound tired. Everything ok?
 Uhh, a little bit. Its a lot of pressure, you know, but thats what I signed up for right?
 Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
 Ok
 Thanks!
 Love you too. Bye.
 Oh man, thats fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
 Oh no, no, no. Thats ok.  Um Im sorry, is this the conference center?
 You gotta be kidding me.
 Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
 Listen, I dont mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
 Alright.  Oh, sorry. Im so sorry. Its my wife, can I take this?
 Right!  Hey, whats up? Everything ok?
 Its still happening right now actually, so uh...
 Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everythings okay?
 Okay, bye.  So sorry about that.
 I love it.
 Okay, Im Kareem. That makes total sense. Im Kareem. Youre Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
 And thats all?
 No one will believe this back home, but thats okay. Let me show you how its done.
  This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
 Sorry, Stinky, cant do it. Too busy.
 Okay. Theres no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
 Hey, Im in Philadelphia right now.
 Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
 No, I hear what youre saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
 Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
 Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?
 What are you doing here?
 Thats so great!
 Its pretty great, right? I mean, were coming along  Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Denniss timeline
  Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
 Well, I mean, I dont even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so These things go down all the time.
  Are you cool to just hang out?
 Yeah?  You ready?
 Lets do it!
 Mm-hm
 And as you know, I was a paper salesman.  Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.
  Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. Theyre going to make you pay for the fish, and they wanted to know when you can start.
 I think Im a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
 The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
  Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
 ...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
 I dont.
 Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
 Hey.
 Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
 Ceces ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. Ive been working with her on her move. Its called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? Its kind of like this. Its pretty cute, right?
 Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
 Yeah. Even you.
 Bye, Dwight.
 Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
 Hey. I was just about to call you.
 I am still in Philly, actually.
 Its insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so Im stuck here trying to keep him on board.
 Pam, I couldnt get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
 Youre gonna do great. And you know what? Mommys gonna record it. So well watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
 Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
 Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes youre not the best with the phone.
 Bye. Â  Yep. See, youve still got to press â€œEnd,â€ Pam.
 Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but hes gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
 Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, hell be calling in any second.
 Hey.
 We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. Its like everything I did, he just wouldnt go for it.
 I have no idea where were gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
 Can you figure out how to upload Ceces dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
 Youre not serious, are you? You didnt get any of the recital?
 Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
 Oh, great. So well see somebody elses kid with Cece in the background? I mean, its really not that hard to film a video.
 Look, Pam, I dont know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? Its gone. That moments just gone. I missed it.
 Youre not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? Im in Philly. These are my days in Philly. Youve agreed to this.
 Pam, Im not explaining this to you-- Pam, Im not going over this again.
 I dont know how else to tell you, okay? Im doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
 Im doing this just for me? Is that what Im doing? Im doing it just for me. If thats what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
 Well talk tomorrow?
 Okay. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 You couldve just called that an alliance too, right?
 Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, thats only gonna make things worse.
 Im talking to him this afternoon, but dont get your hopes up.
 Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so were scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company Im abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So problem solved. Thanks, guys.
 Im on the phone. Im on the phone.
 Im just gonna call you back. Thanks.
 Im sure hes just nervous.
 Sure, yeah, go ahead.
 Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? Youre clean, right?
 Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You dont listen to it at all because were at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, soâ€”
 Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
 Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
 I need you to breathe in my face right now.
 What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
 I knew it, I knew it.
 I looked at you coming around, and I said, â€œWintergreen.â€
 How is it my fault?
 But its Dwight whos bring in all the weirdos.
 Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”
 I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wifeâ€”
 Oh. Um
 Okay. I cant say that thats not fair.
 Oh, yeah, so well just do that later.
 Uh  Well, its about Athlead. Im sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
 Theres a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor â€“
 Yes, okay. Bye.
 No, thanks.
 Dwight, you cant just hire someone â€˜cause theyre your friend.
 Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If Im not looking south, Im not livin.  Thats what I always say.
 But you know I wouldnt hire any of these all-stars.
 Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
 I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
 Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
 And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
 Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
 Too much now.
 That seems inconsiderate.
 All right. I think that went well.
 So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then thatll print outâ€”Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
 Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
 Okay. Im really sorry I told the guys Id be there for the board meeting.
 Ill call you when I get there.
 All right.
 Take care of my wife. I will be back.
 No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when Im gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
 You couldve just called that an alliance too, right?

  Hey.
 We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
 And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, its, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
 Im couching it!
 And this dude labels his food. Hes the clean one. And, Im the messy one. How much fun is this?
 Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
  Who is this guy? We are killing it.
 Yeah!
 Nice job, man.
  What?  Oh, man! Im sorry about that.
 Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
 Oh. Its your go-to therm. Oh, man. Thats a bummer. Im sorry about that.
 No, no. If its a big deal, its a big deal.
 No big deal.
 Honestly, I dont mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or...
  OK. Here ya go.
 Hey.
 Yeah. Totally.
  Its mine. Dont worry.
 I dont think you had to.
 I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldnt use that?
 Thats not the point.
 No, Im not making bread.
 Darryl, it doesnt matter. I think you know the point Im trying to make.
 Its all good. Are we all good?
 Whats that cooler?
 Oh, crap. Were those yours?
 Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, thats just Roommates 101.
 Oh. Oh!
  You win.  How good did that feel?
 Its like magic. Or, its like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
 By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
 They are terrible.
 Oh my god. Thats so romantic.
 Oh my god. Thats less romantic.
 Yeah, yeah. No, totally. Thats good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
 Im very excited to see Brian. Brians a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. Im sorry, but you know him. Hes a good guy.
  Hey, Brian.
 What?
 Oh.
 Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, Ive wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And Im really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
 Well, I mean, thats OK. It doesnt mean that its over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
 What?
 Crying?
 I dont know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I dont know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
 Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
 No, youre right. And, and Im not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably dont have any reason to be mad at all because I wasnt there. So, lets just forget about it.
 You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
 Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and Im sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I dont know, drop me at the bus station?
 I just feel like were gonna fight.
 So... how bout lets not?
 Oh, um.  Happy Valentines Day. Sorry, I didnt have time to wrap it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 No problem.
 You really wanna fight on Valentines Day?
 OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
 Hey! There she is.  How you doin?
 You look great.
 Yeah.
 Ok, I know where youre going with this, and this is who I am now. Im a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.
 You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
  Call you right back. What were you saying?
 Ive gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? Youre gonna crush it, youre gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
 Hey, howd the interview go?
 I cant wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, dont eat because Im ordering in.
 Ill make it worth your while, I promise.
 Alright, love you.
 Hey! Back here.
 Si, senor.
 Oh man. Im so sorry. Are you alright?
 Are you kidding? Were in Philly. Were having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. Its from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
 Alright. So, tell me all about it.
 Tell me about the cologne. How much?
 Youre definitely hoarding this by the way.
 Austin Powers.
 Ferris Bueller.
 Not Night at the Roxbury.
 Im sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
 Its fascinating.
 Thats amazing. Well, listen. You cant win em all, right?
 So, next interview has to be better.
 What do you mean? Of course it will. Youre amazing.
  Huh. This is a little out of left field.
 And I have started a business in Philadelphia.
 My condolences.
 OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
  Im sure... Im sure shes in a better place.
 OK.  This is crazy. You cant make a dirt ball.
 OK.
 Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
 Oh man.
 Oh boy, please dont. Lets not let that happen.
 What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
 Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies first baseman.
 Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
 Yeah. So, uh, Ill uh, talk to you later?
 Ok great.
 Bye.
 Hey man, how you doin? Jim Halpert.
 Lets go to the conference room.
 With our firm, youll be building equity for long after theyve retired your number.
 Right?
 Yep.
 Wow.
 Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, its autobiographical.
 OK
 Space dust.
 Sure, yeah.  Hollywood.  Alright.
 Ok, great.
 â€œTogether we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.â€
 Smart.
 â€œBuy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.â€
  â€œBuy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!â€
 â€œMegan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.â€
 Wow. I tell you what, its really strong. I cant wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
 â€œGotta go! Darth Vaders launching a huge attack.â€
 I dont know how wed go about doing that.
 Well look into it.
 We gotta get him.
 Were gonna go get him.
 Were gonna get him.
 Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
 Its a little, uh, personal.
 I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
 Sorry. Iâ€”no, no, no, what I meantâ€”what I meant actually wasâ€”
 You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
 Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couples counseling.
 No, no, no, no, no. Uh, were just starting couples counseling. Uh, which doesnt sound any better.
 Thats all right.
 So how does it work? Its like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or
 Mm-hmm.
 If I didnt do certain things without telling Pam, shed be married to Roy.
 If she can just hang on for a little while longer, Iâ€”this will be so huge for our family.
 What do you mean?
 Thats kind of an impossible question.
 Well, if Pam says she wont go, thenâ€” were gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
 Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
 No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
 Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each others sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pams been doing to run the house while Im in Philly.
 Mmhm.
 Oh, were supposed to call everything we dont want to do â€œopportunities.â€
 An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
 Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasnt out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
 Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
 Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
 Hey thats work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
 Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think thats a little unfair.
 I guess I will swallow my truth.
 I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think were making progress. So Im really sorry that I have to go but lets keep at this. Ok?
 Thanks.
 Bye.
 Hey!  I...
 I love you.
 Im taking some time off from workâ€”well, my other workâ€”because we needed it.
 Its great.
 But that doesnt matter. This does. Its the only thing that matters. Weve had some really nice days together.
 Beesly! Oh, my god.
 Ah, definitely blue.
 For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thinâ€”
 Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I cant give 100% to two things at once you know.
 Huh. Well, you know, you cant have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for whats most important. Thats my new thing.
 Smasher!
 Fireball!
 Thats pretty good. I feel safe.
 Oh, Clark. Im actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
 You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that Im here.
 What?
 Okay. The annex it is. Ill be sitting at your desk if thats okay with you.
 Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
 Oh, wow. But, umâ€”Oh, I get that.
 I get it.
 Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You dont watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
 I really felt like I almost lost her, andâ€”and nothing is worth that.
 Again.
 Not at all. It should be Dwight.
 Youre gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uhâ€”
 Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely dont want to meet that person.
 Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
 I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
 If you could help me out, that would beâ€”
 Anything would help.
 Oh, also, while youre at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
 Wow, thatsâ€”
 You come so prepared. Aspirin.
 Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. Its really great.
 No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
 I wouldnt be too sure about that. Just saying.
 Wow, hey.
 Whats up?
 Okay.
 Really?
 Yeah, totally you did.
 I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
 All right? Im gonna wait.
 Im sure you did not. What was your question?
 Well, then, I should figure out things to do while Im waiting.
 Look whos back.
 Weeknights are actually tough just becauseâ€”
 Thats true, yeah.
  Congratulations, buddy.
 So.
 Lets hear it.
 Nope. Cant accept that job. Its not a real job.
 Ill tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one Id be proud to take.
 Dont get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
 Oh, dont look at me cause I think youre making a terrible choice.
 You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
 No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? Whats up?
 What kind of offer?
 What?
 Oh, my god!
 Wow, that is wow.
 Yeah, we did. Hey, how longâ€”how long do we think thats gonna take?
 Oh, man. Yeah, I cant do it.
 This, man. I cant do this to Pam.
 I know. And I cant do it.
 Sales form for you to sign.
 Aw, thanks, man.
 No.
 Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
 All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay.
 Yeah.
 I will. I will.
 The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and thats final. I almost lost Pam over this business. Im not risking that again.
 He welcomes you.
 Your agenda-taking pleases him.
 Lets not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if youre expecting a fax today, please dont yell out, â€œMichael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.â€ Ok? Thats nonsense.
 Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
 Thats obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
 Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Whos excited?
 I love Star Wars as much as the next guyâ€”
 My god, Im so sorry. Well this might make up for it I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
 Potential future nonsense.
 Im gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youve got a regional manager.
 Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
 But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
 Exactly.
 Yeah, right. I mean, unless theyre willing to pass some tests.
 Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
 Nothing.
 Members of the office, hear ye.
 Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
 This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but thats for fueling only. No savoring.
 He envies you.
 Alright.
 By 200, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
 A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
 985,000,000,000,017.
 Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
 Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
 Thats exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
 Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
 Come on.
 Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”
 Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
 Do you want a corn dog?
 Well see. You are an assistant whos just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
 Uncanny.
 An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
 Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
 Yeah. Its real. Its the only way youll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! Shes through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
 Look at that form.
 Uncanny.
 You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingâ€”none of these people are good enough.
 What Im about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ive ever said.
 Is-
 The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
 I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  Thats it. You look really, really good.
 Hey.
 You all right? Whats going on?
 Yes, Im happy.
 Yeah.
 What?
 Pam.
 This was my decision, not yours.
 You didnt force me.
 You did not force me to do this.
 I dont know how else to tell you.
 Resent you?
 Is that really what you think?
 Not enough? I dont know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know its against the rules but Im gonna need a favor from you guys.
 You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
 Perform a test.
 Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so Im gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, dont worry, hes the best in the biz.
 Unless you think he cant handle it.
 All right.
  Thank you.
 Well Ive been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldnt believe me, so  I needed a little help.
 OK, I dont have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
 I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
 Ok, um, this is â€”Ill be right back.
 What do we got?
 Wow! Congratulations, thats a really big step.
 Right in the sweet spot. I think youre gonna be really happy.
  Thats a lot of pros.
 So what is the problem?
 I dont know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time Ive been faced with a tough decision, theres only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
 Love.
 You watched it.
 Well, then I guess youre ready for this.
 Its from the teapot. Everything youll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything.
 Here we go.
 Umm.
 I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, its good for the environment too.
 Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
  Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
 And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
 Okay, the limos gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready â€˜cause I want to pack in a lot.
 Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwights night, okay?
 Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. Hes putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years Ive done nothing but trick and prank him but tonightonly good surprises. â€œGuten Prankenâ€.
 Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isnt going to show up?
 Mose has been weird? Thats so unlike him.
 Hey man, good to see you.
 Hey!
 Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? â€œGuten Prankâ€ number one.
 And Jim will say nothing.
 Yeah?
 Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limos here. Lets do this. Change if you need to.
 Get out.
 No, Dwight. Youll be doing the whacking.
 Of course I did.
 Yeah!  Guten Prank number two.
 Private Room.
 Enjoy, enjoy.
 Okay, man, easy.
 Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
 Oh, its the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angelas been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
 They think it was Mose.
 Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub youd ever set foot in in this town?
 Mm, hey driver. Why dont you take us to 3030 Adams?
 Is that Mose?
 Ooh.
 Nope, not a prank. I think its time for you to bury the hatchet.
 Okay, just talk.
 I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrows his wedding day. You cant be anything but happy on your wedding day.
 Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
 Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or
 Right.
 Am I the only one thats nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
 Doesnt seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
 She pays me back every day just by being my wife so thats fine.
 O-Kay.
 Um, you know what, I actually didnt handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
 You ready?
 Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um I dont know how to tell you this, but we have a little bit of a problem.
 The minister just told me that its tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
 I havent heard of it, obviously. But Im out because I am significantly younger than you-
 I think its definitely Well, okay. Either way
 Either way, Dwight I cant be there for you. Im sorry.
 I justreally wish there was something I could do.
 Best prank ever.
  See, now you dont owe me anything.
 I gotta get out of this dress.
 Whats going on?
 No, really, whats going on?
 Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
 Thats why its so clean.
 I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
 Oh okay. Where would we go?
 I promise you, you dont have to do this for me.
 The last
  Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about
 You wanna do this?
 You really want to do this?
   Oh my God!
 Hey, Darryl.
  Lets go outside
 You know what? Maybe we should talk.
 Athleap.
 Dwight, come on. Dont end on a bad note.
 Hey, and if youre ever in Austin...
 There it is.
 Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakesand grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And thatsan amazing gift.
 Thanks Phyl.
 I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didnt love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupidwonderfulboringamazing job.
