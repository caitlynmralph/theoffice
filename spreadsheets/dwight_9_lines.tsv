 How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So thats really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
 I dont see it.
 Yes, yes I am.
 In a way its like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday theyll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then Ill have a grandson.
 Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
 Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
 Well, were both just kinda learning as we go, arent we?
 Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
 So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
 Spoken like a true root man.
 My calls?
 You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
 Ok
 With my leads and stuff like that?
 Cause youre interested in going into sales?
 Wow, thats great. Thats great. Ok, good, lets talk about that, ok?
 Youre not getting my clients! Nice try.
 Paranoid? Im not familiar with the word. And I really dont have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
 Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
 The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
 Wait, salesâ€”what sales meeting?
 The new guys called a sales meeting?
 Theres no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
 Boo, unimpressed. Its a tightrope for babies. Boo!
 Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
  Thats not true.  Just give me another chance.
 What?
 This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it.  Idiots.
 Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesnt seem so macho now, does it? Its a jump rope!
 Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
 Come here, Ill show you.
 Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means its literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
 You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldnt you say?
 So youll do it?
 Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
 Come on.
 No, Pam.
 Please? Please, Pam?
 I cant use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar Ill be launched into space. God, youre so insensitive.
 Ok. Oh, god.
 Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and Im about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
Woo!  Ahh!!
 I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
 No thank you.
 Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
 Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
 Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
 Well, it looks like there wont be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. Youre welcome.
 Anything else would be inconsistent.
  Absolutely, I will.
 I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh.  You dont have a plan.
 What the?
  Gimme that.
 Youre insane.
 Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
  This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that youll miss the most.
 Sounds like a plan.
  This is it. Any questions?
 No. Its gonna be over before you know it.
 Heh! Ha!
 Ha!  This is for real this time.
 No, no. No spoilers. Please.
 No.
  Oh god.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
 Whoopty doo. That doesnt make you a genius.
 Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
 No, like you.
 Youre the stupid one.
 Youre the stupid one.
 You, you, you, you...
 Who are you?
 Youre not Jim. Jims not Asian
 Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why dont you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
 How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
 You dont work here! Youre not Jim!
 I dont know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
 Oh myâ€”! Oh dâ€”! Oh, how didâ€”?  Huhhhhh!
 Ah, French. Its a great language. If youre a chain-smoking acrobat.
 You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
 Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
 I could teach you if you want. Its a lot easier than French.
  Atherozar!
 It means â€œexcellentâ€. And we have begun.
 I throat-rip.
 You throat-rip.
 He/she/it throat rips.
 More of a, barbaric growl.
 Louder! Youre shouting it from the back of a horse!
 Daraas!
 Daraas!   Does anyone here have fermented mares milk?
 People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
 Fail!
  Oh, god.
 Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
 OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
 OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
  Oh, the wires need insulation.  Its a wire people. Im not buying it a fur coat.
  â€œStatistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!â€ That means you cant make me do squat.
 You people dont realize what youre asking. Id have to rip open the walls.  Wed have to shut this place down for a week.
 What? Come on.
 I know what Jim is trying to do. Hes trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
 Had em all my life.
 No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
  Yeah right.
 Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the?
 Some of these kernels have crowned.
 Andy!
 So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
 In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
  Bring it in!
 Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isnt just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus.  If youve got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
 What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now youre locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
 Its not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
 No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
 Get your foot behind the yellow line.
 Im sorry to spoil Jims fantastic voyage everyone, but were almost out of gas.
 That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
 Stop ordering me around, Jim!
 OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
 Im barren, Jim.
 My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
 You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
 Thats genius. Thats the best prank youve ever done.
 Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
 What position did you use to conceive?
 Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didnt you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
 You know theres a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
 Bildenkinder.
 When you dont get out of the way! Out of the way!
 Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? Im gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
 Everybody! Hang on!
 This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
  It may have been the costliest decision Ive ever made.
 My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
 I cant get it out. Try again!
 I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
  Jim, no. No. No! No!
 But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
  At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
 What lab did these little clones escape from?
 Jim. Look Im eating you.
 Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. Im eating Jims.
  Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
 Oh no, Im spilling Jim all over the carpet.
  Hello little pill. What do you do?
 Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation Theres a madman in our midst.
 Dumatril!
 Dumatril.
 This is a pill that I found here in the office. But its not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. Its not for any disorder of the body.  Its for a disorder of the mind.
 Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane...  They are now off their meds.
 Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? Whats going on Nellie? Talk to me.
 Ill get my apprehension kit.
 Hi Daryl. Im just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
 That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
 So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
 Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
 Is that how they like to get in?
  I dont know. I just dont know.
 Hey.
 All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
 You think I dont have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes Ive got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And neer- do- well siblings to take care of. But I dont need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
 Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
 Gotcha! Yeah! Lets see ya get out of this web, huh?
 What?
 Oh.
 I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
 I want some of those pills.
 Oh, no. No, no, no. no. Theyre not for me. Theyre for my cousin Mose. Hes just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
 Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
 He says Thank you.
 I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
 The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when youre famous?  â€œUh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.â€ Its that easy.
  blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...
 ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
  Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
 Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds-  This is Dwight Shrute.
 Iris, thank you so much for having me.
  Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but hes not hands on.
 Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
 Yes..?
  Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
 Thats impossible.
  OK, how is my voice now?
  This is gotcha journalism. You know what? Theyre not gonna gotch me.
 This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say!  I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
 Thank you Sandra!
 Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!
 Get out of here moron!
 uhhhh....no one.
 No, everythings fine.
||
  Thats what Im saying! No of course not!
 My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
 Please sir! Spare him. Please.
 Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! Ive got a solution. I know Wallaces phone number, everyone hold, Ill conference him in.
 David, is that you?
 Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
 Oh, Im OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
 Youre welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. Im gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
 Walk out of the house...
 ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while youre away in prison.
  Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
  Shrute! Shrute!
 Overall, Id say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
  Dwight Schrute.  Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
 And you didnt call Jim - that seems significant.
 No, he shouldnt.
 Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I dont know where Id put you.
 The White Pages.
 The White Pages Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. Theres a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing â€œthe White Whaleâ€. Look at all that sweet blubber.
 Im gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... wheres Stanley?
 Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
 Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, Im back.
 So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
 Her name?
 Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
 Good luck to you.
 That is a damnable lie. I love women.
 â€˜Gy-na said that?
 Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
 Hello.
 May I please speak to your boss?
 Okay, this isnt working for me, â€˜cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
||
 I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
 I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once Im finished, its over.
 I thought it went great.
 Yes.
 Thats impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs dont vibrate at all.
 What are you doing?
 Kind of.
 I am a person.
 Thats a bit extreme.
 Okay, Im a woman.  Im a woman. Good?
 Hello.
 Thank you. Im so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
 Look, I have no problem with women. Its businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Dont lie about your shoulders!
 I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
 Okay, I can do that.
 He used to fight dogs.
 Little of this, little of that.
  Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
 Oh, dear God in heaven.
 Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
 Listening.
 Sorry.
 Okay.
 Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. Ill be right back.
 Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well Ive got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
 Youre the Quiznos.  Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasnt quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
 Hmm?
 Hes been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
 Very good.
 Oh and uh, Molly... I know it cant be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
 Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
 Thats all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
 Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. Its like air to you people. Ugh, God.
 Well, well, well, its finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
 Come on in, the waters fine.
 I know. Thats not why Im naked. I always work out without my clothes.
 Oh, Im sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If Im not in your panties, I dont go vigilantes. Why dont you ask your husband?
  All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
 Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
 I can try. Im gonna use SMS text.
 Text went through.
 All we can do is sit and wait.
  Oh, look at that. Yeah, hes free anytime. Not a problem.
 Get in the van.
 Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I dont see them so I think were good.
  Does he own a gun? Show her.
 Do you have any idea how many guns Trevors had stolen from him?
 Mm-hmm. Good safe?
 Wow!
 You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
 You cant have someone murdered.
 What did they do to you, Angela?
 Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
 Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
 No! No!
 Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. Ive had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
 No! Youre not helping, Trevor!
 No. Angela! What are you saying?
 Im trying, but what youre asking is--
 Okay. But its cruel, because a woman with damaged knees cant scrub worth a damn.
 The target-- its Oscar, isnt it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
 Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time youre engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
 Well I could understand you wanting to get a strangers knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
 I cant even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
 What do you mean?
 No! No, no!
 Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
 Come -- come with me.
 There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. Theyre extraordinary.
 Theres no time to explain.  Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
 What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man whos the father of her child?
 Oh, dont lie. Im trying to save those precious knees youre always bragging about. Â Now, lets get out of here. He could be right behind us.
 Aah! Actually, hes right in front of us.
 No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. Hes a Dunder-Mifflin man. Hes my tribe.
 Disarm!
 Dont move. And disarm now!
 No! No, Oscar. Hes a friend. Hes a friend.
 No.
 See ya later, Trevor.
 I just saved your life. Youre welcome!
 Oscar.
 Youre not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
 I know. Youre gonna be okay, Monkey.
 I dont like him either. Â And yet I really like him.
 Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
 Is it called red-vining?
 We heard it was called red-vining.
 Where are gay mens vaginas?
 What?
 When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other persons penis?
 Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people dont care about Jims new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
 Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and dont wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
 What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas rural German companion, Belsnickel.
 Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
  This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. Theres me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesnt come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
 Yes! Yeah!  Yeah! Okay! Yes! Its a Christmas Miracle!  Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
 Uh-huh.
 Uh, Oh.
 You have never been cooler.
  And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
 That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
  Somebodys found the hog maw.
 What? Its a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. Thats a beauty, isnt it? I dont even want to tell you what its made of until after you try it.
 It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
 This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people dont even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherds Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
 Have you ever tasted a Shepherds Crook?
  Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange.  Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
  Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
 I am nigh!
 Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
 Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo!  Ohh...Too much strudel.
 No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
 Yes, exactly!
 No.
 Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwights traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
 Oh, come on. We dont blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.
 Take a bowl and pass it down.
 No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. Theyre a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
 No, impish or admirable.
 I decided earlier.
 Of course I checked it.
 I checked it more than once.
 Impish or admirable.
 Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable.  There you are.
 Its a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
 You cant have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish!
 No, Im carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder
 Partys over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you.  And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isnt real. Its me, Dwight!
 Oh!  Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
 What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
 Just lice Pam?
 Of all of the vermin in Gods great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
 Make way, nope, inspect me.
  Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
 Its a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials mens suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
 Renters. Ok, Im gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Lets get going. Im gonna stay here and fight. If you dont hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
 Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, its kill or be killed!
 To be burned!
 Im not gonna lie. Lye!
 Lets talk pubes, people.
 Oh sure, and when youre ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
  Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
  Shes right Pam.
 Yeah theres a volume knob on that thing.
 Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...
 Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I dont think its kicked in yet. Im gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
 I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.
 Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. Theyre a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. Wed go in pretending to be family â€“ brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
  I hope youve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because its time for another episode of â€œHandsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hireâ€.
 Oh, god, this again? Youre Stinky.
 Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
 Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim?
 How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
 Mmm. Thats a good question. 300 times  180 Um that comes to 25 minutes.  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
 There he is!  We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but
 Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
 How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
 Then looks like we have a deal Son
 You know, youre right! We hadnt even thought of that, had we boy?
  Oh! Youre a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?
 Guilty!
 It was his birthday, just turned three. So
 But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clarks getting out of my car. Hes a good boy, does whatever I say.
 Oh really.
  Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that theyre not even good. Really, theyre bad. Like you and your son.
 What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
 Youre being disrespectful!
  We dont get along.
 Terrible!
 Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
 I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
 Maybe if you listened a little bit, youd improve. No wonder women despise you.
 His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adams apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldnt see it, or didnt wanna see it.
 Yeah? Like what?
 That never happened. Hes always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught â€œsaving treatsâ€ from the kitty litter box.
 Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
 Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going â€œplease kitty, may I have some more?â€ You cant make this stuff up!
  Got cat turd collector written all over him.
 Do you mind? The men are talking.

 Wait, so youre the boss?
 Yeah, you dont want Italian. Youll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, youll be doing life in Rikers Island.
 That place doesnt exist. Its not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
 Actually You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? Ill take one too.
 Yes! We did it!
 And you closed it. The boys are back in town.  High fives! Ha ha!
 You got me!  I used to collect them!
 Each one is very different, like a snowflake.

 Pfft, â€œAthleadâ€? Please. Theyre too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it â€œStumpany,â€ for â€œStupid Company.â€
 Youre working for â€œStumpanyâ€ too?
 What?
  Hey, Halpert, whats the big idea? First you jump ship. Now youre stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
 You wont stop until youve poached us all.
 No. Ill be damned if Im gonna let us lose me.
 Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
 Youre welcome.
 This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
 Yeah, well see about that.
 Bust out your complaint files. I need everything youve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? â€œInfuriating, irresponsibleâ€...
 Okay, Im gonna need you to print it out.
  Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because its an idea. But what does it mean?
 Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
 No, youre not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? Â L--
 Loyalty.
 Thank you.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years.  So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
 It cant be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
 Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
 You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo!  Here we go! Yeah!
 Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
 Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.
 Yes. Fast food. Ill take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
 Not like this.
 Thank you.
 Nope.  Fire in the hole!  Oh, yeah! Now thats what working at a paper companys all about!
 Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
 Its a youtube thing! Lets go. Lets go. Come on, theyre coming.
  It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
 Ha ha! Yeah, jokes on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
||
 What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
 Thats right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
 Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
 Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jims desk while hes away in Philly. Finally Ill have someone at my desk clump who gets me. Its like, â€œReally, Jim? You dont understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.â€ Wow.
 Mm-hmm.
 You know what? Youre gonna get your interview, okay? I know that youre going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
 Clark has no chance. I mean, hes up against my buddy Rolf, for Gods sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ hell make you laugh so hard, youll puke your pants.
 Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
 I chose my words very carefully.
 Hey. Come on, buddy. Lets do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You dont compare. When youre with the R-O-L-F, youre literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.
 Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
 And this chairs gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
 No doy!
  No earbuds!
 So Ive got your resume here, but its not telling me everything.
 Well, Im the one offering the job.
 Ive worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. Im an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
 Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. Im sure hed give a reference.
 Well, they cant all be winners. But Trevors next and hes a real professional. You say, â€œJump,â€ and he says, â€œOh who?â€ He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
  What makes you think youd be an effective paper salesman?
 Well, its a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
 All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
 There were only two options.
 This is a bus transfer.
 I cant hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
 Okay, heres one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You cant rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
 Thank you.
 Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
 Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond
 And anothâ€”
 No.
 It does, but still no.
 Oh, you think theyre my only friends? Ive got way more friends than that, and theyre all better than the losers who work here.
 Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. Hes got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. Ive got big expectations, Mose-wise.
 What quality would make you a good sales associate?
 It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
 You know we live together, right?
 And Ive never seen you go to work, ever.
 So why is this on your resume?
 When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
  This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And dont lie. I can tell if youre lying.
 David.
 Really? Thats interesting. â€˜Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me whos here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
 Sounds fair to me, David.
 No. Why not do it now?
 Id love to be in the loop, David.
  Id love to invest.
 Id like to give you $100 million.
 Im not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
 You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
 Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
 Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
 Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
 I sure do.
 I will pay you whatever it takes.
 No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
 Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. Youre still at the 570 number?
 Okay. Good, good, good.
 This isnt gonna work out.
 Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. Hes a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet Im hesitant. Why cant I pull the trigger on any of them?
  No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.
 I do that myself now.
 No, youve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
 Or none of you
 I wish I could hire all of you.
 Psst. Jim Jim?  Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
 Just act natural.
 And I was thinking its only fair that you help make this decision since theyll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
 Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, its your call.
 I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldnt picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
 Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
 Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
 What? This is such bullcrap!
 Wow. So much crap. Its just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
 Okay.
 Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halperts home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
 Guys, it wasnt up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasnt my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
 Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
 Okay.
 They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
 Oh, hey, Ill take a coffee.
||
 Who, me?
 Absolutely, I do.
 Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, thats great.

 Welcome to the club, pig!
 Aah!
 You dont have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
 Youre telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
 Lets go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
 Pam, Ill help you.
 If theres anything I hate worse than art, its crime.
  You need my pitchfork?
 What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
 Ah, Im not interested.
 If I get the deicing gig, its not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.
  I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no ones business but my own.
 Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
 Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
 Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
 We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying.
 Its all right. Its all right.
 No. She needs her rest again.
 You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but weve got chewing gum.
 Theres no gum. There never was any gum.
 Oh, your little feelings party didnt work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
 Wait. Are you saying...
 Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And Im like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
 He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something thats important to him.
 A little eye for an eye action.
 Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
 I know just the man for the job.
 He even looks like a mole.
  I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
 Silence. Youll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
 Go move some paper!
 Great. Get the plate number.
 So we know which truck to van...
 Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, Im drawing your mural on Franks trucks butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
 Lets see yours.
 This is amazing! Frank! And hes leaving a trail of poops?
 I saw that. Thats great!
 Good. Im glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
 Ugh! Dont sympathize. Youre ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
  Come in.
  Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
  I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
 I really like Andy these days. Hes pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, were in for an epic, confusing showdown.
  I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
  Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I dont know how you do it. Youre a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
 Youre back.  And youre disgusting.
 Hey, Burning Man, if its not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
 No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that hes been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that youve been gone for the last three months?
 Thank you.
 Yes!
  Yeah!
 You were on a boat.
 On a boat.
 In the ocean.
 Im not gonna say it.
 Not a word.
 No!  What do you think youre doing?
 Dont you dare! Andy!
  Coolio.
 Coolio. Coolio.
 Coolio.
 No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
 Please Ja, Ja...
 Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
 God! I just dont know what wed do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
 Id like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, Im a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
 Fine! The state hes in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
 Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
   lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
 Yeah.
 The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
  No, dont just let her eat the grass, shell puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. Im sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but shes your aunt too. Fine. Ill see what I can do.
  I need you.
 And you should take breaks more often, Ive been waiting there for 45 minutes.
 Its my aunt Shirley, shes on her last legs.
 You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, its all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was â€œpoisonedâ€ by Aunt Shirley.
 Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
 Thank you.
 Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, shes an old woman Angela. She needs a womans touch. Its all hanging out-
 And theres parts of her I dont even recognize.
 Theres this one hanging part in particular, thats some sort of flap.
 Its like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
 Its a divet...
 ..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
 How dare you?
 Aunt Shirley, Hello! Its me Dwight.
 This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
 OK
 You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angelas gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
 Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
 Ok.
 Yeah, trust me.
 It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
 In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
 Now all it takes is half a liter. Shes dreaming. Alright, lets get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
 No, its a lot better than it sounds. Theres a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
 Its hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. Youre gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
 Youll see. Here we go.
 Lets do it! Ready? Heres a box cutter to get her clothes off.
 Lets get to it.
 Give it a whirl.
 I need you to hose my aunt.
 OK you are useless.
 Give me the hose!
 Ahh! OK!
 Yes maam.
 And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
 By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
 Would you like the stink sack?
 No, you dont eat it. Its a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
 Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
 Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
 Leave him. He probably wont even notice that youre gone. Be with me, Monkey.
 Im not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
 Stand by your man. Its what I would want if you were mine.
  Hold it!
 I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
 I would say that she raised me, but lets not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
 My actual mother was very cold and distant. Id say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
 Keep them.
 In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturdays funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
 Excuse me?
 OK. Thats not...
 I really hope so.
 I miss her so much.
 You know?
 Zeke.
 Are you going?
  Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
 Get...
  What are you doing here?
  Oh, yeah.
 Jeb, my brother.
 Uh-huh.
 Doesnt matter. Its a cemetery.
 Well, the only thing were planting here is dead bodies.
 Well, thank god theyre not because we dont want to make zombies.
 You had black hair and then gray hair.
 You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
  Hello, little man. Havent seen you in a few years.  What is this? Oh, god.  Henry.
 I see Esthers back in town.
 Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
 Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
 OK.
 So, lets get it going.
 We Schrutes dont need some Harvard doctor to tell us whos alive and whos dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
  Thank you.
 I cant stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He couldve grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
 Lets do this. Lets run Aunt Shirleys farm. Im in. Boom.
 Of course you are.
 Oh my god.
 You know what? Lets take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirleys offer.
 You will say yes on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say yes, one. Yes.
 OK.
||
 Oui.
  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
 Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
 Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so youre gonna get made fun of a little bit.
 If you want.
 This? No. Thatd be cool, though. Its for milking.
 Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
 Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
 Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
 OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didnt your father teach you anything?
 It.  That kid doesnt put in some farm time, hes gonna stay like that.
  Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. Its officially a hostile work environment.
 Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
 OK, you are useless. Ill take care of this.
 Its OK guys, shes no longer horny.
 Clark, I need your advice. Im having some lady troubles.
 Esther Ruger.
 Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
 Well, weve been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
  What do you think?
 A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
 Esthers on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Lets see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
 Did I tell you about her teeth?
 Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
 Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
 Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because Im interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
 Ok ok ok, wait! You win.
 Security deposit. Thats been-
 Right, standard.
 No.
 No.
 I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
 What? Dont you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, youve got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
 Go on.
 No.
 What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
 No woman would ever want a man who doesnt know what an auger is.
 I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.
 Maybe youre right. Esthers a ten and the best Ive ever done is Angela whos a nine and she rejected me.
 Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe were the kinda guys who end up with a tractor thats already been rode hard and put away muddy.
 By hand.
 I dont know that theres anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
 No.
 That snake!
 That shady grove out by Willards pond.
 So, youre fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
  No!
 Post hole digging.
 Well, the alert was already set to â€œRedâ€ because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to â€œDouble Redâ€?
 What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a newsthing.
 Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We couldve met in the lobby. Its time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
 The buyer is your sisters friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and thats an order.
 Andyâ€” I need to talk to you.
 Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
 So what Im hearing you say is, â€œMake Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possibleâ€?
 Mm-hmm. Good luck.
 For five years Ive held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe its time for me to just let that thought go. Its kind of painful, but its also freeing in a way. Now its all about my instincts.
 Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
 Dont worry, its just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. Its just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
||
||
 Its all right. Andy approved it.
 Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanleys got way more body fat than they do.
 Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Grab his feet.  Lets go!
 Move it! One, two, three.
 Hes like a manatee. Ready? Lets go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three!  Oh, God.Â  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
 Yes.
  Okay, were good. Were good. Lets go. Push!
 I might see a movie.
 What about you?
  Lets take himâ€”
 Lets go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
 Okay, listen. Im kind of embarrassed to admit this, but Ive never actually done this before.
 Thank you. I mean, Ive rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh
 I know. Evel Knievel.
||
 Okay, now heres the plan. Im gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
 Yeah.
 You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? Hes gonna be moving slowly. Its onlyâ€”
 Its 15 feet down, its at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, its like your catching a medicineâ€”
 Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
  You okay?
 Almost there. Almost there.  Okay. Were running late. Lets get him inside.
 Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing thats stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
 Thank you.
 Lets get him inside.
 Well, Ill grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
 Fine, lets go.
 Hoist his shank on three.
 Its by the tenderloin.
 Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, hes slouching. Okay, can youâ€”sl-slouch him into the seat.  Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.
 Got it?
  Get in the back.
 Get in the back.
 Get in.
 Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what were about to do?
 Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like weve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
 New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Lets go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Lets go.
 And forâ€”oh, whoopsie daisy.
 Hes fine. He gets carsick really easily.
 Its a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now were talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
 Stanley.
 Look at him. Ive never seen such a beautiful child.
 Like this? Watch.
  Right? Come on! Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
 Yeah, maybe Ill never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, its the most pleasant Ive ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
 You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didnt even know it. Ill go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
 Wellâ€”no, noâ€”nâ€”
  We need a winch and a hoist.
 Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. Its not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean.  Practically made of plastic.
 Im pumped!
 I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. Im with Esther now.  Shes younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Lets be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
 Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
 Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause its in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
 I call for a refold!
 Its a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
  Whoo!
 Come on Clark!
 Whoa!
 Watch and learn.
 Yes!
 Oh, Esther.
 What are you-  Youre here early.
 I like a little feather in my nuggets.
 Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
 In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
  Yeah! Ok! Beat that!  Whoo! Ok.
 After you.
  Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, howd that happen? God.
 Alright.
 Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office.  Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andâ€”
 Smasher? No, whered you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the citys best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
 I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students dont spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
 I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
 Ah!  Thats how its done.
 He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
 Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.
 Just slip it off myâ€”Slip it off my hips.
 He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
 There it is.
 We did it, we did it. I love you.
 Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. Youre gonna watch me right?
 Sensei, youre not watching.
 Watching?
 Watch this part, okay?
 You did not just say that! You dont know Pam. She is really cool.
 Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. Its out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. Id be happy to see Jim as manager.
 You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
 Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the managers job?
 Yeah, right. Im afraid that ship has sailed.
 Hello.
 Big day for you.
 Thank you.
 Oh, yes.
 This is exciting! Youre finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
 Oh, I doubt youll make it. Very few do whove tried to be a star. But, listen, youve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
 Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, dont quit your day job.
 Youre bad.
 Say it again.
 Where?
 What branch?
 Im sorry. Ive just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
 But this isnt interim manager. No. Its Dwight K. Schrute  Manager.
 In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
 I will never, ever let you down.
 David. Can I just do one thing while youre making this announcement and then Ill never, ever do it again?
 Its just one thing. Just let meâ€”let me do thisâ€”
 Just wait and send it to voicemail.
 Come on. Come on.
  Dwight Schrute is manager!
 Pam.
 Thank you, Jim.
 Get out of Jims seat.
 Youre an annex kid. You might be bullpen, well see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
 So
 I wanted to offer you a new position.
 Assistant regional manager.
 Jim.
 Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
 So, all the numbers adding up?
 Thank you.
 Yes, it is. Carry on.
  You okay?
 Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
 Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now theyre protecting Americas real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the days security codes. Something thats been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. Its not the KGB, but its a start.
 But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
 This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
 The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
 Ah, much, ok.
 No, no. Give me the steam.
 Its just harmless steam to panic intruders. Id like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
  Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
 Oh, dont worry. Theyll get got.
 Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check on that later today. This is my grandmothers ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmothers buttock bullet ring.
 You know what to do.  Ok
 Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
 Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but weve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warâ€”
 Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
 Welcome.
 Please take an agenda item.
 Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. â€œSome say the only failure there is is the failure to try.â€  That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
  What is going on?
 Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
 Im letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
 Not now! Private time!
 Hey, hey! Seriously?
 Which is, of course
 Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
 The power source.
 A loyal, but bungling apostle.
 Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
 Id have to get some more wire and string, but its doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
 I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
 That doesnt sound crazy, Jim. Thats the sanest thing Ive ever heard.
 That means ye, Plop!
 We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
 Youll always have the upper hand, when youve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
 Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
 You dont need to repeat right now, when Im saying it.
 Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
 Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each others minds. Youre trying to give your wife this job.
 No, no, no, no! You dont read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. Theres no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries dont have diplomatic relations.
 A thousand times more.
  No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
  Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Heres your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
 I know.
 Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
 Me.
 Yes!  Thank you.
 Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
 Smart baby. Thats the most flavorful bond.
 Oink the pigs, that is very important.
 The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
  Thank you, Esther.
 I need you to perform a test.
 On an innocent baby.
 Damn straight.
 Hey, he can handle it.
 Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, theres no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
 Okay.  You ever been in a managers office before?
 Phillip, you wanna play a little game? Its called â€œSchrute or Consequences.â€ Youre gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
 Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but youre no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
 That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when hes being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
 Door. Chair. Its about Phillip.
 I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
 Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, lets face it, is a big step up from living in a gay mans closet.
 Very well.
 Yes.
 Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
  Now.
 Jim. Im not kidding. I need you.
 I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
 Shes got a ton of great qualities. Shes young, shes beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because were third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isnt technically incest.
 Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
 And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
 Angela.
 Some sort of virus?
 Oh.
  Pull over!
 Move to the side of the road!
 Pull over!
  Shut up, woman!
 Listen to me! I love you! And I dont care that Phillips not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
 This expresses how loudly I love you.
  This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
 I love you!
 What?
 What? Why would you say thatâ€”
  Get out! Im a dad!
 The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
 pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
 PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
 In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. Im getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, theres a mini-reunion. A kind of a â€œwhere are they nowâ€ panel at a local theatre. Itll be nice to see everyone again.  I havent seen Kevin since we let him go.
  Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
 No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake isforKevin.
 Go ahead and just read the frosting.
 Uh-huh.
 Its a colloquial way of saying â€œyoure fired,â€ Kevin, which you are.
 The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
 Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
 Basedon his merit.
 Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Heres your cake.   Bye, bye Toby.
 That is all. Have a good morning.
  What was that for?
 Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
 Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that hes been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
 I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band â€œThe Grass Rootsâ€ in the 1960s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
 Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That wont be necessary tonight.
 Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, hes been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
 What? Ooh!
 I thought you guys couldnt come.
 Uh, better ask Jim.
 Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isnt on the itinerary.
 Jimwha Come on! Whatwhat are you gonna whack me, Jim?
 A bazooka. You remembered.
 . Get out of my way.
 Woo! Okay!
 Amazing.
  Man, how long have we been sitting here?
 Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
 No, we havent ordered anything. No ones even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?
 Oh, we do. So well have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
 Yes, an onion loaf for the table but thats not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
 Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chefs special? Tastes like cigarettes. That wont work. Thats no good.
 Now, for the last time, Id like a side salad with balsamic.
 Youre telling me!
 What for? We havent even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?  Do you have those? Those arent deep fried, right?
 Oh, man, never thought Id say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.
 Good old Mose.
 Oh, great. Hes getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
 A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
 Right. Which one is that?
 Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
 Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!   Oh.
 I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
  Why did you pick this place?
 You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
 Waste of a good hatchet.
 I heard you say â€œwellâ€ the first time.
 It was nothing personal. Its just that you were terrible at your job.
 No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
 Thats it.
 I missed you Kevin.
 Ohh.
 Youve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
 Mose! What..ooh, Mose.
 No. We cant see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
 With todays modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather its our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
  You kidding? I was born ready.
 Oh, no. What?
 Oh, come on. Ive never heard of such a thing.
 Not significant is a big word
 I think youre only a teeny
 Jim.
   Michael. I cant believe you came.
 Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. Theyll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab â€˜em on in there.
 Good night.
 Good evening.
 Hey guys.
 Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun?  What is that meaningful look?
 No, dont say it. Youre fired! Youre both fired!
 Dont be an idiot. Its for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year youve been here. Thats the max.
 Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if youre ever in the area, youll always have a place to stayin my barn.
 Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I dont have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So have I gotten along with my subordinates? Lets see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. Soyes. Id say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
