Pam|  Well, I should go.
Jim| Alright.  Ill tell everybody here that you say hi.
Pam| No, dont.  Im mad at them.
Jim| Why, what happened?
Pam| Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Jim| Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didnt tell them.
Pam| What?  Why not?
Jim| I just didnt, you know, want a deal.
Pam| Come on, it wont be that bad.
Jim| OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Pam|  Hi everyone!
Oscar| I thought you were already engaged.
Jim| Nope.
Angela| That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
Jim| Thank you Angela.
Kevin| I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
Jim| Yes.
Andy| A little close to my engagement there Tuna, whats your game here?
Jim| To get married.
Dwight|  Shes not a virgin, you know.
Pam| Wow.
Michael|  Whats going on?
Pam| No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi.
Creed| The tall guy got engaged.
Michael|  To be married?
Jim| Yep.
Pam| Sorry.
Holly| Pencils down!  Just kidding, take your time.
Holly| Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz Im going to run my first ethics meeting here.  Its gonna be insaaaaane.  No, its not.  I have to read from the binder.
Dwight|  I got it, I got it.
Michael &amp; Holly| Lets get ethical!  Ethical!  I wanna get ethical!  Lets get into Ethics yeah!  Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk!  Your body talk.  Let me hear your body talk.
Michael| WOO!  Alright!
Michael| "Why are you helping her?  Youre not even dating."  Shes my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
Michael| Ok, lets give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!
Holly| Thanks Michael.  Today were going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Kevin| Oh come on!  Hes right there.  He was hired.   Oh check it out, "Hired Guy."
Jim| Nice.
Ryan| Ok, elephant in the room.  Lets talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and Ill give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Michael|  Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, youre a good guy.
Holly| Lets start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Phyllis|  I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Holly| Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Michael| Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
Holly| Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Kelly| What?
Holly| Yes, its called time theft, and its the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
Stanley| This meeting.
Andy| Hey-oh!
Dwight| Yes.
Michael|  Cant set em up like that.
Kelly| Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then Ill just take up smoking.  Ill do it.  I dont care.
Meredith| Ill smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Holly| Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Michael| Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Dight| Michael.
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Michael| Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Holly| Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Michael| Do you... just... youre kind of losing them.
Holly| I am?
Micheal| Yeah, dont think about the stakes.  Itll freak you out.
Holly| Ok.  Michael makes a really good point so, uh, lets just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  Thats not right.
Michael|  Lauren,  enough with the pencils.
Holly| No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  Its part of the ethics thing.
Oscar| That isnt ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Andy| Ill drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Oscar| Exactly, Andy.
Andy| Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
twice|.  No big deal.
Dwight| Its a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, its not your real family.  Youve been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Andy| No thats... not how it works.
Michael| I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
Holly| Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Michael| Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
Oscar| Pass.
Michael| I will go first.  When I discovered
<a href="http//www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>| I didnt work for five days.  I did nothing.  I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
Holly| What was the dilemma?
Michael| To tell you or not.  And Im glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Holly|  Oh--- no no no.
Michael| Yeah, .  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
Oscar| Ok, once in a while Ill take a long lunch.
Michael| A siesta!
Dwight| Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
Jim| Dwight, youve really never stolen any company time?
Dwight| Never!
Michael| You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
Kelly| Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Michael| Who hasnt?  Good.  Good!  What else?
Holly| No--- I, Id like to hear more about that.
Michael| Mmm...
Angela| I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out hes clean, but Im glad I did it.
Michael| Well, lets keep this party movin on.
Meredith| Ill go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Michael| Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Meredith| Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Jim| Jackpot.
Michael| Ach! Wuh---
Holly| Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, theres also an exchange of goods.
Meredith| Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Michael| Thats crazy.  Thats crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got?  You know what?  Thats a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Whos to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, lets give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work.   Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
Holly| Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
Michael| Oh...
Holly| I mean all of you have done things I wouldnt have done myself but Merediths actions are really over the line.
Micheal| Nnyeah.  What ya gonna do?
Holly| So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Meredith| Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I dont know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
Michael| Meredith, why dont you tell Holly... its not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
Meredith| Am I in trouble here or something?
Michael| No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Holly| No, its not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Meredith| Nah, I wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper.  Theres not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Micheal| Ughh!  For the love of God were trying to help you... stupid bag.
Holly| What I dont understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Meredith|Well its funny.  Maybe its a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself.  Hey whats going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Holly| Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean Ive never heard of anyone whos kept their job after something like this.
Meredith| Well... Im not quitting.
Jim|  Yawn.  Four seconds.
Dwight| What are you doing?
Jim| Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so... Im just making sure.
Dwight| Oh, so wait a minute, youre going to time me every time I yawn?  Thats absurd.  Really?  Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  Hes ti---
Jim| Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
Dwight| There is no way that that was---
Jim|  One second.
Michael| Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  Its a miracle, youre at your desk.
Holly| Its Mike-raculous.
Michael| Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  Youll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and theres no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people cant, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
Holly| Sounds good.
Michael| Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Holly| Oh I already bought this...
Michael| Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.    Sorry!  You know what?  Lets go out!  Dunder Mifflins treat.  Um, actually youre not a client... so... well just split it?  Ethical.
Holly| So, Ive gone over corporate policy.
Michael| What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
Holly| Oh, its very nice.
Michael| Istnt it?  Yeah, its kind of... business/romantic.  So youre from Des Moines?
Holly| Mmm.
Michael| Wow, that sounds so... warm.
Holly| In Summer.
Michael| Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
Holly| Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Michael| Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  Its just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Holly| Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just dont think there is any way I can write a report that doesnt end with her being terminated.
Michael| Wow, terminator, terminator.
Holly| Im from da future.
Michael| Yeah.
Jim| Hey, Andy.
Andy| Yo.
Jim| By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Andy| No, I did not.  Was that any good?
Jim| Actually not.  It was really so-so.
Dwight| Ok.
Jim| I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Andy| Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
Jim| You know, its weird.  Its practically a shot for shot remake.
Andy| Really?  Huh, thats cool.
Jim| Storys kinda bland.  Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Andy| Really?  That doesnt sound right.
Michael| I just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
Holly| Well, thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Michael| Ok, new idea.  We dont report it at all.  We just punish her.
Holly| We punish her?
Michael| Mmhmm, tell her she cant have sex for six months.
Holly| I dont think we could enforce that.
Michael| I dont know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
Holly| A chastity belt.
Michael| No, its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
Jim| He has not stopped working for a second.  At 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 132 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I havent even started work.  Its exhausting, being this vigilant.  Ill probably have to go home early today.
Michael| I am just saying that I dont think that you understand what I am saying.
Holly| No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Michael| Yes.
Holly| What am I saying?
Michael| Well... bleh busted.  I dont...
Holly| Im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I dont think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Michael| Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
Holly| Its not a family.  Its a workplace.
Michael| I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I dont want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers.
Jim|  19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Dwight| None of your business.
Jim| So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Dwight|  Fine.
Jim| So maybe youre not completely ethical after all.
Dwight| Yes, maybe Im not.
Holly| Its been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office wont even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
Ryan|  Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Michael| Whats the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Ryan| Two HR reps.
Michael| You get me.
Holly| Can I sit?
Michael| I dont know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
Kendall|  Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and theres a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..
Holly| Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
Michael| Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
Kendall| Well, Im not sure these circumstances warrant any action.
Holly| Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Kendall| Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area.  Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I dont know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.
Holly| Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but Im just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Kendall| I thought it was clear with you, Holly.  Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.
Holly| No, I understand.
Kendall| Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if its not something you can handle then thats a different discussion.
Holly| No.  I can do it.
Kendall| Good.
Michael| How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so."  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like its a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
Holly| Can I have everyones attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyones attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Andy| No way, lady.
Kevin| Its a trap.
Holly| Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Meredith| Dont sign anything.
Michael| Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
Stanley| Its a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Michael| Get in there right now or Im gonna lose it!
Meredith| Am I getting fired?
Michael| Now is really not the time, Meredith.
Holly| In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Phyllis| Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
Meredith| Hey, where is the steak sauce?
Kevin| I think were out.
Meredith| I got some in my minivan somewhere.
Andy| Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
Kevin| I think she got it as a tip, but I dont know why she didnt just take cash.
Phyllis| I dont care what shes doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Stanley| Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
