Michael| Hup!
Pam| Things are a little slow here. And theres only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out theres no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someones face.
Michael| Hup!
Pam| Were getting pretty good at it.
Jim| Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that cant be right.
Pam| The timelines messy.
Jim| Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Andy| This is my solo.
Pam| Im confused. Am I walking down the aisle to You Can Call Me Al?
Andy| Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Jim| I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Andy| Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
Pam| I dont know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Andy| Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Pam| Mm-hmm.
Phyllis| Whats wrong with you?
Dwight| These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Phyllis| I think you look nice.
Dwight| Doesnt Charles know hes compromising my attack readiness? Its not a dress code. Its a death sentence.
Charles| Looking good.
Dwight| Kay, thank you. Its a straight jacket!  Okay.
Dwight| When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybodys worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Michael| Hey.
Dwight| Hey. Eds Tires is thinking of making a change.
Michael|  Is this good?
Dwight| They have some great kitchen ideas.
Michael| Oh. Okay. Eds Tires, huh?
Dwight| Its small, I know.
Michael| I really appreciate it.
Dwight| Thanks, Michael.  Wait, what is this?
Michael| Its for your trouble.
Dwight| Wh-  I dont need $6 to help a friend.
Michael| No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Dwight| Michael, you know I cant take this.
Michael| Yes, I do.
Dwight| But dont forget you owe me $10.
Michael| That was four years ago. Why dont you let it go?
Dwight| Michael.
Andy| What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Jim| I think she just didnt want a crucifix cake.
Andy| It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Jim| Am I going down a road?
Andy| When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
Jim| Its so scary how right the things youre saying are. And youre coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Andy| I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
Jim| I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Michael| Eds Tires. Why dont you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
Pam| Im not gonna do that.
Michael| That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Ryan| I can get there.
Michael| Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Ryan| Oh, awesome.
Michael| Bring it in. Morning cheer.
Michael, Pam &amp; Ryan| U-G-L-Y, you aint got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
Pam| Im here. Im a part of this now.
Dwight| You needed to speak to me?
Charles| Dwight, take a seat.
Dwight| I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Charles| Nah, thats weird. Youre gonna sit.  Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin lately?
Dwight| Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Charles| Ive just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesnt go unnoticed.
Dwight| Your concern is noted.
Charles| Yeah, I like your work ethic. Youre so... focused.
Dwight| Like a wolf. Thank you.
Charles| And I wanna start givin you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Dwight| Really?
Charles| Definitely.
Dwight|  Its firm.
Michael|  I need you to get me the prices that youre charging Eds tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight| I dont know that I can do that now. You know, uh, somethings come up.
Michael| Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight| No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. Its not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, theyre changing fast.
Michael| Im not following you.
Dwight| Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then theres this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Michael| Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think Im getting your drift.
Dwight| Good, do you see what Im saying?
Michael| Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that youre writing?
Dwight| No.
Michael| Can I use it?
Dwight| No.
Michael|  Dwight, are you talking about us?
Dwight| It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Michael| Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight| It is the situation that we are in now.
Michael| So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, dont you?
Dwight| Im not a barbarian.
Michael| Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight| I will.
Michael| Dwight?
Dwight| Yes?
Michael| Is the cool new guy Charles?
Dwight| Ive said too much.
Michael| Is it Stanley?
Jim| Hey, Andy. You know Ive been thinkin about what you said-
Andy| Noishe.
Jim|  -I just dont know if I can do it.
Andy| Thats interesting, because I hear what youre saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and Im like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, Im so happy. Im so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
Jim| Its just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. Im pretty emotionally needy.
Andy| And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants.  Ah, whatd you do that for?
Jim|  You know that I was doin this.
Andy|  Totally.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| Hello, Dwight. Whats with the shirt? Are you alright?
Dwight| Im sorry, Michael
Charles|  Hi, Michael.
Michael| Oh my God! Run! Run! Its a setup. Setup!
Charles| No, Mich-Michael.
Michael| Dwight, run!
Charles| Michael, no, lets be cool, ok?
Michael| You be cool.
Charles| Yes.
Michael| Just-whats going on?
Charles| We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me youve been pestering him for company info.
Michael| Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Charles| He did.
Dwight| I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now Im okay with it.
Charles| Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Michael| I. Understand. Nothing.
Michael|  Wow.
Pam| Michael, are you alright?
Michael| It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Pam| Tell us what youre talking about.
Ryan| Yeah.
Michael| Its like, a girl says shell make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Pam| We cant help you if you dont just tell us what happened.
Michael| I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I dont know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I dont know. Is that clear enough for you?
Andy| Hey, Jim.
Jim|  I just totally blew a sales call.
Andy| Bro, I do that all the time.
Jim| Yeah, well, with you its different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Andy| Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Jim| Why? When I look in the mirror, I dont like the face that looks back.
Andy| Well, so what?  Your bodys a ten.
Jim| Forget it.
Andy| Jim.
Jim| I said forget it.
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute.
Michael| Hello, traitor.
Dwight| I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Michael| I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Pam| Michael!
Michael| Im just getting hardcore with him.
Ryan| Finally.
Michael| Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
Dwight|  Mr. Schofield, please?
Secretary| Hes in a meeting.
Dwight| Dammit!
Michael|  Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated phone voice| If youd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first.
Stanley| So, you think Michaels going after the whale, huh?
Dwight| I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. Im not worried.
Phyllis| You sound worried.
Dwight| And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, were all making observations!
Michael|  Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Ryan| Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Pam| I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael| Wow. High score?
Dwight| And no, I cannot lower my current prices.  Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, youre considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Dwight| Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So its not exactly like Highlander, but still...
Michael| Hello, Dwight, Ive been expecting your call. What do you want?
Dwight| I would like to arrange a truce.
Michael| So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Dwight| Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael| No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? Theres no-
Dwight| Michael.
Michael| Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Dwight| In which direction?
Michael| Toward the sun.
Dwight| At what time?
Michael| Noon.
Dwight| That-
Michael| You have two seconds.
Dwight|  Michael.  Sorry.
Michael| Dwight.
Dwight| Michael.
Michael| I hope youre not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Dwight| You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael| So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Dwight| And not come through for you?
Michael| If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Dwight| I want a truce.
Michael| I do too.
Dwight| Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredos.
Michael| Coopers.
Dwight| I had fish yesterday.
Michael| Damn it.
Michael|  Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Dwight| Oh, hi, Michael. Im so sorry Im late. I got stuck in traffic.
Michael| Really? Thats weird. We didnt see any.
Dwight| I hit a bear.
Michael| What?
Dwight| Hes technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.  Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Michael| Yeah, sure.
Dwight| Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?
Michael| Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. Hell be here in a sec.
Pam|  Sounds neat.
Ryan| We can spend a couple days there.
Pam| Oh my God, I think weve been robbed!
Michael|  Yeah.
Dwight| Did you enjoy your lunch?
Michael| Dwight, not now, weve been robbed.
Dwight| No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Michael| No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? Youre still stuck in traffic.  You?
Dwight| Me.
Michael| What about our truce?
Dwight| I broke it.
Michael| On purpose?
Dwight| Yes.
Michael| Why?
Dwight| You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy youve created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Michael| Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Dwight| And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Michael| Oh.  Bastard!
Dwight| Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is  Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you dont say.
Dwight|  Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend."  "Tall" and "beets."
Dwight| And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife.  I see youre begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Michael| Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Dwight| Sure. Thatd be fine.
Michael| If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Dwight| This is war and that is what happens.
Michael| Oh, one more thing. Im going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Dwight| Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Michael| Oh, uh oh, Im turning you down right now.
Dwight| Michael! Michael!
Michael| You can hear me, but I cant hear you.
Secretary| Mr. Schofields ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Michael| Oh, great. Mr. Schofields ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Dwight| Dont let him in! Hes a traitor! Michael!
Michael| Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield| Michael, good to see you.
Michael| Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And Im closing the door.
Michael|  Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Mr. Schofield| Really?
Michael| Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Dwight| Are you saying you invented paper?
Andy|  Okay, okay.
Jim| Oh, God.
Andy| Okay, Tuna.
Kelly| Hey, guys.
Jim| Hey.
Andy| Hello.
Andy| Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Heres the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I dont know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but heres the deal, ok? It stops now.
Kevin| I guess I could be nicer.
Phyllis| Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Andy| Oh, really?
Phyllis| Mm-hmm.
Jim| Okay.
Andy| Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin here?
Jim| Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Andy| Uh, thats not what was-
Jim| And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you dont think youre ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Andy|  Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Michael| What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Dwight| Its not the soil! Its the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
Secretary| Uh, hello, Dwight.
Dwight| Spin move.
Secretary| Oh-
Dwight| Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Mr. Schofield| Dwight, Im in a meeting.
Michael| Thats very rude.
Dwight| I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Mr. Schofield| Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
Dwight| La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Michael| Im going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Dwight| Come on.
Michael| Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
Dwight| What hes not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Mr. Schofield| Why dont you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Michael| That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Mr. Schofield| Uh, ok, sure.
Michael| Good, good, good. I will see you.
Dwight| Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, hows your gay son?
Mr. Schofield| Excuse me?
Michael| I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didnt bring it up?" Most colors mean "Dont say it."
Dwight| How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Michael| I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesnt feel as important though. Thats just how the world works, I guess.
