Dwight|  Hey Michael?
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
Michael| OK, just remember to keep breathing.
Dwight| My cervix is ripening.
Michael| OK, good.
Jim|  Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through  delusion.
Dwight| Michael! My waters breaking!
Michael| Oh, OK! OK!
Dwight| Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Michael| I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
Dwight| Right. Highways or surface roads?
Michael| I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
Dwight| No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Michael| I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
Dwight| Its about adapting to the circumstances.
Michael|  Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Andy| Yes! Yeah.   Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Dwight| No. OK, no.  Im crowning!  Im crowning!  Aaaaaaaa!
Michael| All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
Dwight| The pressure!  The pressure!
Michael| Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
Dwight| Aaaaaaaa!
Michael| Aaaaaaaa!
Dwight| Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
Michael| Just keep pushing...
Dwight|  Hold me!
Michael| Im right here.
Dwight| Cradle my head!
Michael| Im right here, Im right here.
Dwight| Im screaming, Im screaming, Im screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
Michael|  All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
Dwight| Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Michael| Shhh. No, you cant have it.  Its too late.
Dwight| No! I dont want natural!
Michael| No.  You have to just push it out!
Dwight| OK!
Michael| Keep simulating.
Dwight| Aaaaaaaa!
Michael| OK!
Dwight| Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael| Keep simulating.
Dwight| Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael| Yes, I do!
Dwight| OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Michael| OK.
Dwight| Ready?!
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Aaaaaaaa!
Michael| Aaaaaaaa!  Its coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Dwight| Butter. Newborns are slippery.
Michael| Nice touch.  Good.  Lets try that again.
Michael|  It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
Michael| Hello ladies, hows my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
Phyllis| No.
Michael| Damnit, Phyllis!  Im sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Angela| Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy." And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name "Astird."
Phyllis| That cant be right.
Angela| Michael wrote down "Astird."
Michael| She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Meredith| Ass...turd.
Michael| I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if Im not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, wheres my golden shower, Phyllis?
Michael| It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. Its like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... its so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
Phyllis| Hey, Im collecting for the baby shower.
Kevin| But Phyllis, its not his baby.
Phyllis| I know, Kevin.
Oscar| Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriends unborn sperm bank baby?
Phyllis| Look at it as if youre paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
Phyllis| I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  Im no longer under Angelas heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Michael|  Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Dont talk to them.
Phyllis| Sorry.
Michael| Make the party.  Dont - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
Pam|  So you know Stacy, right?
Jim| Right, the one from England.
Pam| Theres no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
Jim| Oh. Right, that style.
Pam| So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogres DeTech half an hour early so they dont have to sit on the slab.
Jim| OK...
Pam| Anyway, Bogres TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
Jim| Wait, whos Sarah Kayacombsen?
Pam| No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Dont interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
Jim| OK.
Pam| So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way.  You cant reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacys new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Jim|  No... way!
Pam| Yes!
Jim| Ha ha. Thats hilarious?
Pam| No, its horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
Jim| Who, Stacy?
Pam| No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why cant you just be in art class with me?
Jim| Uh...
Pam| Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.
Jim| OK, Ill ta...Ill talk to you later.   That was a good story.
Dwight| Whos Sarah Kayacombsen?
Andy| Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  Whats going on here?
Angela| Its a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Andy| Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Angela| Thats Phyllis.
Andy| Well -
Angela| Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Andy| Why would that make me a pervert, I -
Angela| Well, it does.  Thats me.
Andy| Thats not you.
Angela| Yes it is.
Andy| Thats mean, come on, thats -
Michael| Ahoy, matey.
Holly| Ahoy.
Michael| Ahoy. So, how you doin?
Holly| Good.
Michael| Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  Its all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while shes here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And Im treating Ryan the same way.
Holly| Of course. Yeah.
Stanley| I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  Theyre always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, Im constantly hungry - do you think my nipples dont get sore too?  Do you think I dont need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
Jim|  Jan.
Jan| Hi, Jim!
Jim| What do we have here?
Jan| This is my baby.
Jim| Really...
Dwight| Oh no...
Dwight| Jan had the baby and Michael wasnt there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybodys.  Except Michaels.
Michael| So this is Astird.
Jan| Astrid.
Michael| Oh, OK.  Why didnt you call me?
Jan| Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Michael| I could have helped.
Jan| And the birth instructor thought it wasnt a good idea for you to be there, so...
Michael| Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
Jan| OK, you dont have any idea what Ive been through, so, lets...
Michael| No, I dont!
Jan| Im sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Michael| Can I hold her?
Jan| Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Michael|  All right, OK.
Michael| I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think its because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
Michael|  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst...
Jan| trid.
Michael| ...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  Youre going to know them for the rest of your life.
Jan| Well...
Michael|  Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go.  Lion King!
Jan| Michael, Michael, Michael, thats... yeah... thats too high.  Ill take that.
Michael| OK, come on, lets get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
Holly| You OK?  You seem kind of...
Michael|  Im fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
Michael| Ready to play some games? Lets do it!
Kevin| Michael, the babys already been born.
Michael| Uh, duh.
Kevin| So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Michael| No, the baby doesnt ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Lets just do what you were going to do.
Kevin| OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Michael| All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Jan| Thank you.  Thats very sweet of you.
Michael| Whatta we got?
Angela| Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Michael| Oh!
Jan| Thank you.
Michael| She already has a stroller.
Kelly| And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Oscar| Shes got an Orbit; thats a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Dwight| Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Michael| OK, what else?
Dwight| Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
Jan|  Being good isnt always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / Hed come and tell me everything is all right / Hed kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
Pam| Hey you!
Jim|  Hey!  You busy?
Pam| Not even. Im doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Jim| OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jans shower is going on right now, and shes singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyones just staring at her.
Pam| I cant hear anything, theres like, theres like machines going-
Jim|   The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - shes been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Pam| I cant hear anything!
Jim| Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Pam| OK.
Pam| Im not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. Were just... a little out of sync.  You know, thats all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
Jan|  How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that hes all mine / Learning from each others knowing / Looking to see how much weve grown / And the only one...
Dwight|  Dont hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
Dwight|  Dont get stuck on the barbed wire!
Dwight|  Playtime is over!
Andy| So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Jan| Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Angela| You gave birth in a tub?
Jan| Yeah, its a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Kelly| Um, so youre in the tub with everything?
Jan| Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Creed| Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Jan| Oh no, its actually really hygienic, Creed.
Creed| Ugh.
Stanley| Im done.
Oscar| Me too.
Jan| And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
Michael| Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
Michael| I could have helped.
Jan| Youre sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Michael|  Uh, yeah.
Jan| All right.  Um, Im just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  Im exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrids 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Michael|  I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
Michael| Phyllis?  Could you take-.
Michael| Hey guys.
Darryl| Whats up, Mike?
Michael| Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
Darryl| You a baby daddy?
Michael| Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Darryl| Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Michael| I just saw this baby daddy-
Darryl| You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy."
Michael| Why, Darryl, because Im quote white quote unquote?
Darryl| Because youre not a daddy, and its not your baby.
Michael| Well-
Darryl| You feel connected to his baby over there?
Michael| Its- thats different.
Darryl| You feel connected to this?
Michael| Thats not a baby.
Darryl| You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Michael|  Could I?
Darryl| No.
Jan|  Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Holly| I can imagine.
Jan| Wheres Astrid?
Holly| Oh, I think shes on a sales call.
Jan| On a what?
Holly| Waaa! More paper! Waaa!   No, shes just on a coffee break.
Jan|  Thats funny.
Holly| Shes with Angela.
Angela|  Thats good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Andy| OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
Angela| Now. Come on, up here!
Andy| Look up here!
Angela| Your hands in it.
Andy| What? Sorry.
Angela| Yeah, thats a good one.
Jan| What are you doing? Whats going on? Excuse me.
Andy| Were taking a picture.
Jan|  There you are.
Andy| Shes natures bounty.
Jan| You dont flash around a newborn baby.  Dont you know that?
Jan| Michael, I need your help.
Michael|  I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
Jan| Uh... come on.
Dwight| I like to call this... the bumper test.
Michael| Sure you cant stay a little longer?
Jan| Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
Michael| All right.  All right, everybody, were leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
Jan| You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Dwight| Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Jan| Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
Jan| OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Michael| OK?
Jan| Dont date Holly.
Michael| Wha - thats, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, cause I dont, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
Jan| Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And Ill see you... soon.
Michael| All right.
Jan| OK.
Holly| You still gonna be mean to me?
Michael|  You wanna go out?
Holly| Yes.
Michael| I didnt feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
Jim|  Hey, its Jim.  Leave a message.
Pam| Hi.
Pam|  Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
Jim|  Hey, its me.  It is 503.
Pam| I figured Id catch you walking to your car, but...
Jim| You must be out or something.
Pam| Ill leave a message.
Jim| Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Pam| I guess this is just one of those days.  Itll get better.
Jim| Hope you didnt have any major laundry issues.
Pam| I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
Jim| Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Pam| And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
Jim| Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, Im just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Pam| Youre probably upset that Im even at a Laundromat right now.  But, dont worry, Im being safe.  And Im headed home.  Im... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Jim| Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
Pam| Anyway, um... I miss you.
Jim| I miss you.
