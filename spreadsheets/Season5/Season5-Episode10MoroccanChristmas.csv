Dwight| What is this?
Jim| Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Dwight| Youre so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Jim| Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Dwight|  Yeah, no such thing.  They dont give out black belts for things that are stupid.   Well, I hope it was worth it, cause Im gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
Jim| I think itll take you a little longer than that.
Dwight| Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- 
Stanley| Eh...
Phyllis|  Im sorry.  Its the largest one I have.
Stanley| I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. 
Phyllis| This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is "Nights in Morocco".  This isnt your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course shes from Morocco, in which case its very accurate.
Michael| Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party? 
Phyllis| Yes.
Michael| Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
Phyllis| Angela. Youre going to move this for the party right? Its not on theme.
Angela| Its the nativity scene.
Phyllis|  Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Angela| I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.  
Phyllis| I need you to get rid of the tree.
Angela| But--
Phyllis| Thank you.
Phyllis| Oh, I dont think its blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I wont tell everyone that shes cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Jim| Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
Dwight| These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.  
Dwight|  Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year its a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase "My horn can pierce the sky".  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isnt that right princess? 
Jim| Thats the Christmas spirit. 
Dwight| I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
Jim| Yes.
Michael| Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Dwight| They are now.
Michael| Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
Michael| This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
Meredith|  Oh... my... GOD!!!   Hit me again.
Michael|  Alright... One more time around the block.
Jim| I will grant you one wish.
Pam| I wish that youd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Jim| Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.  Dumb.
Andy|  Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.   Theres a place in France where the naked ladies dance. 
Angela| Really Andy? Its Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
Andy|  Theres a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
Michael|  Jim, Jim....
Jim| What is it?
Michael| That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
Jim| Wow, that is delicious.
Michael| Yeah.
Jim| Cant believe no ones thought of that.
Michael| I know.
Meredith|  Ahh yeah!!
Meredith|  Belly dancing!
Guy buying doll| 120, 180... 200.
Dwight| All right.
Guy| Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
Dwight| Oh, so glad I could help.
Guy| Thanks.
Dwight| Merry Christmas.
Guy| You too.
Dwight| Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
Michael|  Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadnt left India.
Jim|  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Dwight| We got a live one!  On fire!! 
Meredith| Im all right. Im all right.
Andy| Sorry.
Oscar| Were back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Michael| Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
Oscar| What about February 2nd?
Jim| Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Michael| No, no. I celebrate privately.
Jim| Thats cool.
Michael| Why dont we just do it now? Well do it quickly.
Oscar| Now? Its our Christmas party.
Michael| Well do it quickly.
Jim| Well what if we cant do it quickly.
Michael|  What if we cant do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
Oscar| Do you know how to do an intervention?
Michael| Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
Michael| An intervention.  Its sort of hard to describe, but really its-- its a coming together... its a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.
Phyllis| It looks like were going to be here for awhile, so why dont you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Angela| I dont--
Phyllis|  And napkins... fanned.
Michael| Okay, how do you feel?
Meredith| A little better. I threw up.
Michael| Uck... T.M.I.
Kevin| Fire girl.  Too soon?
Jim| Yeah.
Michael|  Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
Toby| Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Merediths work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
Michael| I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Meredith| Im not an alcoholic.
Michael| Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. 
Dwight| Aye.
Michael| The ayes have it.
Meredith| I dont care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic. 
Michael| Alright, well, lets look at this a little bit closer then shall we? 
Andy|  When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few peoples empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight Bs.  They called me Buzz. 
Michael| Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Meredith| Sure.
Michael|  Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
Meredith| Obviously.
Michael| Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Oscar| Where did you get this?
Michael| I got it on a website, thats not important.
Toby| Michael, We should contact some experts.  You dont know what your doing.
Michael| Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  Im doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
Kelly| Yeah, cause this is kind of a drag.
Michael| Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Heres what Id like to do.  Id like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  Ill begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  Thats how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Merediths drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we dont say anything shes not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.
Kevin| Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Michael|  Thats-- you didnt-- you werent hurt by that.
Kevin| Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith. 
Meredith| Youre welcome.
Michael| Okay, no, thats not what were going for.  Who has a problem with Merediths drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, dont you have anything?
Dwight| No, I like Meredith.
Dwight|  Actually, I dont care for Meredith, but I dont believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.  Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Michael| Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
Meredith| I am fine.
Michael| Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
Meredith|  I know I drink. I like to party
Michael| I want you to say Im an alcoholic.
Meredith| I am not an alcoholic!
Michael| You can say it as loudly as you want, but were not going to believe you.
Phyllis| I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate.  I dont think theyre appropriate anymore.
Angela| Please stop making me do these things.
Phyllis| Oh, sorry, its your job.
Angela| But its the season of mercy.
Phyllis| You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why arent you wearing the hairnet?
Angela| I lost it. 
Phyllis| Ok... nice.
Meredith| I dont mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Michael|  Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and youre dead?
Dwight| I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Dwight| There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Michael| Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
Dwight| Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Michael| Dwight--
Dwight| She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Michael| ...okay.
Dwight| I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Jim| Yeah, but youre gonna need a permit for that.
Dwight| Oh right, thatll take a couple of weeks.
Creed| I can get you one in an hour. 
Dwight| Really?
Toby| Okay you know, this-- this is over.
Stanley| I agree.
Jim| Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Michael| Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  Its Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
Michael| You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  Thats my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so Im not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
Jim|  Theyve been in there for 45 minutes.
Pam| I know.  If she wasnt an alcoholic before, she is now. 
Phyllis| Thats a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. 
Stanley| Mmmm... chewy.
Jim|  Hey. 
Andy| Whats up?
Jim| Do you take requests? 
Andy| Sure.
Jim| Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Michael|  Ill be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? 
Toby| Sure. Wow.  Ow...
Meredith| We just missed Poor Richards.
Michael| We did?
Meredith| Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Michael| Oh, shoot.  Oh well, well have to go someplace else then I guess.
Meredith| The Bog? Coopers, Kellys...
Michael| We could go there, sure.
Meredith| ...Brixxs, Carmens...
Michael| Yes, yes.
Meredith| ...The Fort, Andy Gavins.
Michael| I have a new place.
Meredith| Well, it must have just opened up.
Michael| It-- yep, recently.
Meredith| Yeah... all right.
Michael| All right.
Meredith| Enough of this Christmas crap.  Lets get some party music.   Yeah!
Michael| Yeah, oh there you go.
Meredith| Yeah!
Michael| Thats good.
Meredith| Yeah thats better.
Michael| Were party girls.
Toby|  Hey Sasha, its daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
Sasha|  Daddy, daddy, daddy!!
Toby| No, No, No.  No, Im just curious if youve heard of it.
Toby| This is great.  My ex-wifes going to be so pissed.   For once daddys gonna be a hero.
Dwight| $200.
Darryl| Yo.
Toby| Hey, Id like to buy one of your dolls.
Dwight| Oh, thats my last one.
Toby| Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
Darryl| Thanks man.
Toby| I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Dwight| Not my problem.
Toby| But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- Im-- Im begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
Darryl| All right man, dont cry.  Its cool.  Ill let you get it for $400.
Toby| I only have $200.
Darryl| You can owe me.
Toby|  Oh man, thanks, thank you,  thank you, thank you.
Darryl| I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
Toby| Oh thanks.  Shes gonna...  oh...
Darryl| Something wrong with the doll?
Toby|  No.  Its even-- its even better than the one I wanted.
Meredith| Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Michael| Its okay. Its all right.
Meredith| No way!  There is no way! No way!
Michael| Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
Meredith| No way!  No way!  There is no way!  
Michael| Here we go. This is gonna be good.
Meredith| No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!  
Michael| Yes you are. 
Meredith| I am not going in there! NO!!
Meredith| Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait! 
Michael| Shhh... just calm down.
Meredith|  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Michael|  Come on. Shh...
Meredith|  No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Michael| Heres the door. Heres the door.
Meredith| There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Michael|  Lets start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
Meredith| This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Rehab Nurse| Can I help you?
Michael| I have a deposit.  Alcoholic. 
Meredith| No! No! No! No! No!
Michael| So do I sign?
Meredith| NO!!!
Phyllis| I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
Angela| Its outside.
Phyllis| I didnt ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Angela| Shut up.
Phyllis| Excuse me?
Angela| Im not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know youre not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you wont be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Phyllis| Okay.  Angelas having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Tobys going away party.
Dwight| Well dont look so surprised.
Pam| I knew it.
Jim| You did not know it.
Pam| I knew some of it.
Jim| Everyone knew some of it.
Pam| Its Christmas.
Jim| You knew it.
Pam| Thank you. I knew it.
Jim| She knew it.
Michael| As it turns out you cant just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.
Andy| All right, everybodys still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise Ive been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.   Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. 
Angela|  I think Id like to go home now.
Andy|  Sure. Dooo. Tough room.  Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
