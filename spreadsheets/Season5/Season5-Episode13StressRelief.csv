Dwight| Last week I gave a fire safety talk.  And nobody paid any attention.  Its my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.   Today, smoking is gonna save lives. 
Dwight|   Does anyone smell anything smoky? 
Angela| Did you bring your jerky in again?
Dwight| 
Pam|  Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God! 
Phyllis| What--
Andy| Whoa, fire!
Dwight|  Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  Whats the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Pam| The phones are dead.
Dwight| Oh, how did that happen?
Kevin| Its out in the hall.
Dwight| No, we dont know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Michael| Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm. 
Dwight| Whats the procedure, everyone? Whats the procedure?
Michael| Stay  calm!
Dwight| Wait, wait, wait.
Michael| Everyone, now  calm down!
Dwight| No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If its hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Michael| What does warm mean?
Everyone|  Oh my God.
Dwight| Not a viable option.
Pam| Try a different door.
Dwight| Okay, whats next?
Michael| Dont run.
Dwight| Oh! Heres a door.  Check that one out. Hows the handle?
Andy|  It-- its warm.
Dwight| Well, uh, another option.  
Jim| Back door.
Dwight| Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Phyllis| Oh! I forgot my purse.
Stanley| Leave it woman!
Michael| Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
Dwight| Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... 
Oscar| Ah! My hand!  Thats hot!
Andy| Aah! This ones hot too!
Michael| Okay, were trapped.  Everyone for himself.
Dwight| Okay, lets go. 
Everyone|  Out of my way! Lets go. Get out of my way!
Dwight| Calm, please
Andy| Get out of the way!
Dwight| Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Andy| Move it!
Dwight| Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?  
Angela|  Its okay.  Shh shhh.
Dwight| A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Lets remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, thats the wrong way.  Weve already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Angela| Oscar.
Dwight| Whats next? 
Angela| Oscar!
Oscar| Stay alive!  Im getting help!
Angela| Pull me up!
Oscar| Youre too heavy!
Angela| I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit!  Oh!
Dwight| How about 911?  Anyone? 911. 
Pam| What do we do? 
Dwight| Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Jim| Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. 
Angela| What is that?  What is that?
Andy| The fires shooting at us!
Phyllis| What in the name of God is going on?!
Andy| Yes!  Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
Phyllis and Creed| Ahhhh!!! 
Andy| Go, go, go, go, go!! 
Michael|  Help!! Help!!
Stanley| Im about to die!
Dwight|  Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Jim| What?!
Dwight| Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise.  So, what have we learned?   Oh come on.  Its not real Stanley. Dont have a heart attack.
Michael| No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! Im gonna give him mouth to mouth.
Jim| No, no, no! Dont give him mouth to mouth for this! 
Michael| Hes going to swallow is tongue. 
Jim|  No. Michael. Michael.
Michael| Open your mouth.  Come on. Dont swallow it.
Jim|  Michael! Michael!
Michael| Leave me al--
Andy| Youre choking him! 
Michael| Saving him!
David Wallace|  How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
Dwight| A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Michael| Electricity.
Dwight| Shampoo.
David Wallace| You could have burned down the whole building.
Dwight| I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. 
Lawyer| Did you shout, "Fire!", causing a panic?
Dwight| Yes I shouted "fire!".  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Michael| Hed. Hedded
Dwight| When no one hedded--  
Michael| Take hedded of.
Dwight| N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Michael| Heed. Heed.
Dwight| So, you--
Michael| Take heed of. 
Dwight| And, well, I dont see my co-workers--
Michael| Take heed of.
Dwight| Hee-heeding this right now.
Lawyer| Wh--what?
Michael| Okay.  This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. 
David Wallace| No, we are mad. 
Michael| Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
David Wallace|  No, were not. 
Michael| I am not a mind reader, David. 
David| Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Michel| Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer. 
Dwight| No.
Michael| And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesnt like. 
Dwight| PETA.
David Wallace| Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Michael| Do you?
David Wallace| Michael?
Michael| You talking to me?
David Wallace| Yeah.
Michael| What?
Dwight| Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely.  It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. Whats the matter? You hungry?
Michael|  No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A mans life is in my hands.
Dwight| Dont you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. 
Michael| Thats not gonna happen. Im taking over as safety man.
Dwight| What? You?
Michael| Yes. 
Dwight| Come on.
Michael| Im a smart guy.  Ill figure it out.
Dwight| Thats preposterous.
Michael| No, I will.
Michael| Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today."  Thats what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true. 
Michael| Shhh! Dont excite him. Dont make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley. 
Stanley| Thank you, Michael.
Stanley| Its true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people... 
Stanley|  Not maybe. Yes or no. 
Stanley|  No way. Uh-uh.  
Stanley|  Are you from another planet?
Stanley|  Boy, have you lost your mind? Cause Ill help you find it.
Stanley|  Did I stutter?
Stanley|  Im done. Goodbye.
Stanley| But the doctor said if I cant find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings Im going to die.
Michael| Andy.
Andy|  A throne for your highness. 
Stanley| Im not sitting in a wheelchair. 
Michael| No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
Stanley| Im going to die.
CPR trainer| A-B-C. Okay?  And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation. 
Michael| Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
Dwight| This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Michael| Shut it.  Shut it.
Michael| We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket. 
Kevin|  I cant keep doing this forever.
CPR Trainer| Its been 20 seconds.
Kevin| Call it. 
CPR Trainer| Would you like to try next?
Dwight| Absolutely I would not.
Michael| You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Stanley| Oh, I dont know.
Phyllis| Thats not a good idea, Michael.
Michael| Come on.
Phyllis| He needs to rest.
Michael| No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops?
Stanley| I would die.
Michael| And youre okay with that?
Stanley| Im okay with the logic of it.
Michael| Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Lets do this. 
Stanley| Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but Im too old to find another job and I dont have enough saved to retire.  I feel like Im working in my own casket.
Michael| Come on Stanley.  Youre losing you.  Youre losing you. Do it!
Angela| Michael!
Michael| This is you were talking about.
Angela| Michael.
Michael| Okay, okay.  Ill show them. Here we go.  Stanley.  All right.  
CPR Trainer| So, assessing the situation.  Are they breathing? 
Michael| No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs. 
Rose| No, thats not part of it.
Michael| Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
Kevin| I would want to live with no legs. 
Michael| How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You dont do anything.
Rose| All right, well, lets get back to it. Cause youre losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute . 
Michael| okay, thats uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Jim| Hows that gonna help you?
Michael| I will divide and then count to it.
Jim| Right.
Rose| Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of Staying Alive by the Bee Gees.  Do you know that song?
Michael| Yes, yes I do.  I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Rose| No, its--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive.
Michael| Okay, I got it.
Creed|  You were in the parking lot earlier. Thats how I know you. 
Michael| Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive.
Michael| Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... 
Andy| Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk Im a womans man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, its alright, its okay,  you can look the other way. Loo do do! 
Rose| Okay! 
Andy| Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Rose| Okay! 
Everyone|  Stayin alive, stayin alive.
Rose| Yeah, okay.  You didnt maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didnt arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
Dwight| Okay, hes dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? 
Rose| I have no idea.
Dwight| Anyone else?
Phyllis| We bury him?
Dwight|  Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. 
Creed| He has no wallet, I checked. 
Michael| He is an organ donor.
Dwight| He is.
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.  Here we go.
Angela| Oh my God! Dwight!
Kelly| Dwight!
Angela| What are you--  What are you doing?
Dwight| We search for the organs. Wheres the heart? The precious heart.
Stanley| Im not feeling well.  I need to sit down. 
Michael| Hey, Stanley. 
Andy| Stanley. 
Michael| Are you okay?
Angela| Oh my God! 
Stanley| Oh my God!
Angela| Dwight!
Dwight| Clarice?
Stanley| Oh my God!
David Wallace| Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Dwight| I didnt think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, its pretty realistic.
David Wallace| We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars. 
Michael| Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Dwight| Wow.
Michael| Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person. 
Andy| Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn.  Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
Pam| We dont normally download films illegally.  Because were honest,  hardworking people. 
Jim| And we dont know how.
Pam| But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
Jim| Punishment fits the crime.
Jessica Alba|  I want you to meet my nana.  Nana... 
Lily| Mmmhmm... 
Jessica Alba| This is Sam. 
Sam| Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Lily| Please-- Call me Lily.  Lets play Bridge.  You can be my partner.
Sam| Alright... Lily. 
Jim|  Whats going on?
Jim| Uh, no one really knows, but Pams parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Pam| My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jims been great. But Im gonna need to buy my dad a robe. 
Pam| Hes not saying what he needs to say. 
Andy| Hmm? Who? Sam?
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what theyre saying to everyone else, then--
Andy| Hmm.
Andy| Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. Theyre catching things that are totally going over my head. 
Michael| Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? 
Dwight| I have.
Michael| Lets hear it.
Dwight|  "I state my regret."
Jim| You couldnt of memorized that?
Dwight| I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. Its not a big deal.
Phyllis| It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Dwight| Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
Pam| Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
Lily|  Im in here.
Sam| I uh, Im sorry I didnt uh, realize you were in a bath.  Do you want me to go?
Lily| I want you to stay.
Jim| Gimme a break.
Andy| I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophies mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
Sam|  Get that in there. Oh yeah.
Lily| Get that done already.
Sam| I know but if I get it in deeper...
Jim|  Can you believe this?  He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Andy| Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I dont think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
Pam| So he doesnt share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughters fiance?
Andy| You guys, theyre making out.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
Jim| Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Pam| 
Jim| What?
Pam| I dunno. I mean, maybe hell talk to you about some of this stuff cause he cant really talk to me about it.
Jim| Mmm... 
Pam| Youre good to talk to.
Jim|  Im ok, Im not, great, and um... 
Michael|  Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.  Ohmmm my God if youre wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... 
Michael| My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. Its kinda nice... 
Michael|  It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
Jim| Dont open your eyes.
Pam| What?  Oh... 
Michael| And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Meredith| Chunky monkey.
Michael| Too expensive.
Stanley| Chocolate.
Michael| Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
Stanley| Its my bio-feedback machine..
Michael| Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
Stanley| It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
Michael| You have stress?
Stanley| Yes... 
Michael| During our relaxation exercise?
Phyllis| Let me get you some water.
Michael| No no, Ill help you. Ill help you up. Here we go.
Stanley| No, Michael, No. 
Michael| Let me getcha.
Stanley| Would ya, would ya step back please
Michael| Ok, alright.
Stanley| Please. A little further.
Michael| Ok. 
Stanley| Thats better. 
Michael| Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? Thats what HE said! Right guys, cause of gay?  Lets give this a shot.
Michael| Hellloo... 
Kevin| Michael, I think youre whats stressing everybody out.
Michael| So... it wasnt Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that youre the killer... its uh... great twist. Great twist.
Pam| Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
Pam| What did you say to my dad?
Jim| What?
Pam| After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
Jim| Oh my God. Pam, I dont know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, Im so sorry, I dont know. Ill call him again. 
Jim| Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents... 
Pam| What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
Michael| I dont get it. Do I stress you out?
Dwight| Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Michael| Oh... 
Dwight| Speaking of which... 
Michael| Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. Its what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge. 
Michael| Ok everybody, Ive figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is whats causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short... 
Kelly| A vacation.
Michael| What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh cmon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? Youve seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybodys laughing, and everybodys hugging each other... 
Oscar| Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Michael| Si senor.
Oscar| Thats offensive.
Michael| Its not! Its not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Dont hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that Im so fit, or Im a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I dont want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
Kevin|  Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Oscar| I consider myself a good person. But Im gonna try to make him cry.
Michael| I can already feel peoples stress starting to melt. I think theyre very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
Dwight| May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Phyllis| Hey, this is your apology letter.
Dwight| That was the last signature I needed.
Michael| Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If youre here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Angela| If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, heres a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. 
Angela| I normally dont enjoy making people laugh. 
Angela| If you ever called the fire department cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Group| Michael Scott! 
Michael| Hey Hey, I dont go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
Kelly| I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Michael| Youre so lucky! Good one... 
Meredith| Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said "Gross"... 
Michael| Well... 
Meredith| Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Michael| Pow pow pow... 
Oscar| 
Michael|  NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. 
Jim| Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Michael| I know where this is goin.
Jim| Do ya? 
Michael| No... 
Jim| Ok. Remember Spider face?
Michael| No.
Jim| OK. Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Michael| Spite her - ok  
Jim| Yeah... yep.
Dwight| How dare you all attack him like this. 
Michael| Oh, stop it Dwight.
Dwight| Michael is your superior.
Michael| No no no no no no!
Dwight| Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Michael| Dwight youre supposed to do it this way.
Dwight| Ok, no, they dont understand who they have...
Michael| That is the way youre supposed to do it, idiot.
Dwight| Youre interrupting me. Im trying to get your back.
Michael| Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
Dwight| Are you calling me an idiot?
Michael| Idiot. 
Dwight| Dont you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You dont have any friends, or any family, or any land. 
Pam| Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  Hes supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Michael| Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
Pam| Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! 
Michael| Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after theyre done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
Darryl| Mike claims, were all a family isnt that right?
Michael| We are, we are a family. 
Darryl| Ok, so um, whats his name? All the way in the back there.
Michael| Oh very funny.
Darryl| Whats his name?
Michael| Uhh... hehe hah! Im thinking Roy?
Darryl| Roy left years ago. Whats his name?
Michael| I dont believe I have had the pleasure.
Warehouse Michael| Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic... 
Darryl| Whats 
his| name?
Michael| Jefferson.
Darryl| Nope. His name is Michael. 
Andy|  What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, youre the laziest, jerkiest and youre dumber than applesauce. Were stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well its true. Thats what I hate about you. Thats what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
Michael| Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isnt tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... 
Pam| Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, Im sorry, Michaels not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
Dwight| Its very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? Hes either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And hes like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Kevin|  He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. 
Oscar| Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Kevin| Im almost done.
Oscar| That reeks, and Im trying to eat.
Dwight| Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Jim| Yep. Youre being replaced.
Pam| I think he meant personal day.
Dwight| Oh, thats quite a leap Pam.
Phyllis| I hope hes ok, I feel bad.
Creed| Give it up, hes dead.
Jim| He just sent a text... 
Creed| Whats a text?
Michael|  Caw... caw... caw caw... caw... 
Michael| You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems dont matter to him, because were just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  Im okay. No, Im not.
Pam| Phyllis theres a package for you.
Phyllis| Oh, ok. 
Dwight|  Got it.
Lily|  Sam, Sam Sam. Its not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, its that you lied to me. Cant you see that? Cant you see? Oh, I can never trust you. 
Sam| Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I dont care how much time we have left. I dont care what my friends say! And I dont care what your mom thinks! Frankly Im pretty sure shes not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment.  Lilly. Im not giving up. Im not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!
Andy|  Sam! Sam!
Pam|  Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah Ill see ya then.
Jim| So what did he say? Was it my fault?
Pam| Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, youve never doubted for a second that Im the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess hes never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
Jim| You ok?
Pam| Yeah. 
Pam|  When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. 
Andy| I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad. 
Pam| Michael! Its really good to see you.
Dwight| Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Jim| Are you alright?
Oscar| Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. 
Michael| I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
Pam| What?
Michael| Well I wrote them down so I wouldnt forget. Jim, youre 611 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, youre a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted.
