Erin| Oh my God! I cant believe it! I jut won an art contest!
Erin|  Thanks. I still dont understand why you wanted me to say that.
Dwight| Shut up.
Dwight|  I got her!
Pam| Not cool, Dwight.
Jim| Not cool.
Michael|  Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Michael| Guys, Im scared. Im really scared. I think Im growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Dwight| I do.
Michael| Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Pam| Oh, I cant do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Michael| Oh, really? Ok.
Pam| Just sent it.
Michael| What about the rest of you?
Michael| At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I dont know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Michael| Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ryan| I dont do lunch. Im eating five small meals a day now.
Ryan| Now that Im back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Michael| Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Angela| No. I dont want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Phyllis| Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Michael| What?
Phyllis| Work.
Michael| Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Pam| If you dont take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Pam| Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Michael|  I... was just learning... to... love.
Erin| Hi, guys. How you doing?
Dwight| Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Erin| Right. Im sorry.
Dwight|  Now, how can I help you?
Erin| Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Dwight| Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Pam| So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Dwight| It is a big deal. Cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learners permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Erin| Sure.
Jim| There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Pam| Were getting married today.
Jim| So, it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Pam| Tell em how it happened.
Jim| Ok. So, were going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Pam| And very expensive.
Jim| Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and thats great but then you have to invite -
Pam| You cant leave anyone out.
Jim| No one.
Pam| Ok, just get to the good part.
Jim| Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."
Pam| I had just woken up. I didnt look cute. Thats how I knew he meant it.
Erin| Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Michael| No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Erin| Well, I like to swim.
Michael| Thats good.
Erin| You have a cool place to come hang.
Michael| If you ever want to come down here, doors always open, locks broken, so...
Erin| Thanks.
Michael| Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Erin| Wow.
Michael| Now you got it.
Erin| Now I do got it.
Michael| Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Erin| Oh, yeah.
Michael| You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Erin| Thats rule #1.
Michael| Ok. I love it. I love it.
Erin| Whew.
Michael| I love it.
Michael| Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. Theres no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Michael| Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Busters People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I dont know. Its like  Dave died or something.
Michael|  Daddys here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Oscar| Please dont refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael| I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy|  Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Michael| Andys afwaid?
Andy| Yes.
Michael| Are you all afwaid?
Dwight| No.
Michael| Daddys here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Pam| What?
Michael| Funk is the problem and the solution.
Jim| That makes sense.
Michael| Ive taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Oscar| Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael| Why dont you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Dwight|  All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Meredith| This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Michael| No. Dwight is confusing you. That - its, its more of a disco.
Andy| Its like a haunted disco.
Michael| ... with coffee but without the haunted.
Phyllis| Its a combo dance house coffee bar.
Michael| Its a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Erin| Its a cafe disco.
Michael| Exactly.
Kevin| So, like, a disco cafe?
Michael| Wha - No. No. Not even close. I cant force you to go down but I can entice you. Im gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Michael| Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Kevin| Yeah.
Michael| Holdin down the fort.
Kevin| Yeah. This place is great.
Michael| Thank you.
Angela| Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Kevin| Im sorry.
Michael| This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin| Yeah. Respect the lei.
Angela| Come.
Michael| Kevin, stay.
Angela| Kevin, come.
Michael| Kevin, stay.
Angela| Kevin, come.
Michael| Stay, stay.
Angela| Come on, right now.
Michael| Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Angela| Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Kevin|  Is there a cookie?
Michael| Mmm-hmm.
Angela| Wha -
Michael| Come on.
Angela| Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. Theres no cookie. Theres no cookie. Come on. Come.
Kevin| I wanted a cookie.
Angela| Completely unacceptable.
Michael| Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly youre just some terrible monster.
Andy|  Everybody Dance Now", spins in chair] Oww!
Phyllis| Aw, what the hell?  Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Jessica| Oh, hes on a call.
Phyllis| Oh, Ill just duck my head in.
Jessica| Its pretty important. He wouldnt want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Phyllis| Tell him Im going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Jessica| Ill let him know.
Phyllis| Mmm-hmm.
Michael| Phyllis?
Phyllis| Hi.
Michael| Hey!
Phyllis| Hey. I like.
Michael|  Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Phyllis| Oh! Mother ******!
Michael| Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Phyllis| Back!
Michael| Oh, wow! What did you do?
Phyllis|
Michael| You didnt do that. Youre ok. Youre ok. Lets lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Phyllis| Wow! Sorry!
Michael| Ok. Thats ok. Thats not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Dwight| Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Whos Phillip?
Michael| No. No. No.
Dwight| Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Phyllis| Its my back.
Michael| Its her back. We just - We need - Lets - You know what?
Phyllis| Call a doctor.
Michael| Were going to take care of you. Were gonna get you help. Lets - come on.
Phyllis| No. Call Bob.
Michael| Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
Dwight| Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Michael| I dont need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Dwight| What do you think history is?
Michael| Its just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
Michael|  Alright. Here we go.
Dwight| Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Michael| You having fun?
Erin| Oh, my God! What happened?
Michael| What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, were going to put you in here. Dwights going to take care of you.
Phyllis| What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight| You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Michael| Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oscar| What happened to Phyllis?
Michael| Oh, you know. Nohting. Shes  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But shes a tough, old bird. So...
Angela| Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Michael| Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I dont think she would trade that memory for anything.
Stanley| I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Michael| You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Erin| Yes.
Michael| I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Erin| Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Michael| I dont care. Bury it. I hope youre happy.
Dwight|  Im gonna need two able bodied men.
Kelly| Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Erin| Youre bad.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 1| Theres girl in there.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 2| Where?
VRG 1| The other room?
VRG 2| What other room?
VRG 1| Down the hall.
VRG 2| Theres girls in there?
VRG 1| Whatd I just say?
VRG 2| You have another sandwich?
VRG 1| Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
Michael| I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Dwight| You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Phyllis| Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight| Come on. Relax. The shirt wasnt doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Phyllis| I do.
Dwight| No kidding! She sits three feet from me. Its the most annoying thing.  Its like children singing Christmas carols.
Andy| Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Erin| Ashley! You made it!
Oscar| You invited someone?
Erin| Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Oscar| Ive been here 8 years and Ive never...  Rude.
Andy| Im not sure, but Im pretty sure Im in a dance off. Alright!
Michael| Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Creed| I hear it, too, Boss.
Michael| Its better than I imagined it!
Phyllis| That feels good, Dwight.
Dwight| Tell me where it hurts.
Phylis| Right... mmmm... right there.
Dwight| Oh yeah. youve got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Michael| Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Erin| Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Angela| Stop!
Michael| Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Angela| No. I didnt come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Michael| Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela| No. You need to sign them all.
Michael| No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Angela| Look, I hate to be "that" person but I just dont like the general spirit of music.
Michael| I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. Were not going to eat you."  No.
Dwight| This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Phyllis| An hour? I cant stay here an hour.
Dwight| Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
Creed| Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Michael| Hey, thank you, Creed. youre really getting this place.
Creed| No problem. Ill just have no idea whos driving behind me now.
Dwight| Im gonna with the python.
Phyllis| But the rattlers so scary.
Dwight| No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Phyllis| I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
Dwight| Whats so funny?
Phyllis| When I say it out loud its so silly.
Michael| Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
Angela| You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Michael| No... cleaning... up.
Jim|  These are for you.
Pam| Theyre beautiful.
Jim| You ready?
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| We should probably stop by. Itd mean a lot to him.
Michael| Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? Its really happening.
Phyllis| Wanna dance, Dwight?
Dwight| Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Bob Vance| Mind if I steal my wife?
Dwight| You cant steal what is legally your property.
Bob Vance| Are those staples?
Andy| This dance competition is not over.
Kelly| What dance competition? I was just dancin casual with my friends, yall.
Michael| You guys are the best for coming. You dont have to stay if you dont want to. I understand.
Jim| Were gonna stay.
Michael| Really?
Jim| Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Michael| Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. Its not even to "Y".
Pam| This is so cheesy.
Jim| Yes.
Pam| I like cheesy.
Jim| Me, too.
Pam| Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding.
Jim| Me, too.
Pam| Really?
Jim| Yeah.
Michael| Would you like to dance?
Angela| No.
Andy| Yeah. No. Well, ok.
Kelly| Stop squirming.
Andy| Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Kelly| You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Andy| I, I - but youre not a professional and Im thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
Kelly| Im doing it. No. Im doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise Im gonna mess up.
Andy| Are you sure thats not the "gay" ear?
Kelly| Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Andy| Well, I...
Kelly| Look, Im gonna count to 3.
Andy| Count to twen - count to twenty.
Kelly| No. Im gonna count to 3.
Andy| K
Kelly| 1... 2... 3
Andy| Agh! Son of a bitch!
Kelly| Andy, that was just the ice.
Andy| It was?
Kelly| Yeah. It was.
