Jim|  You gonna answer that, Kev?
Kevin| Oh, right. Thanks.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you.  Oscar, your mom!
Jim| Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?  I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Kevin| Please hold.  Andy! Phone call.
Jim| No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier. 
Kevin| Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Jim| It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Kevin| Okay. Andy, get ready.  Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Jim| Here we go. 
Kevin| Oh, man!	
Andy| It is 1-3-4, Kev! 
Jim| Kev, cmon.
Dwight| Hustle!
Kevin| Hold it.
Andy| You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Kevin|  This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. 
Angela| Youre bad at this too!
Kevin|  Just... dont answer that call! 
Stanley| Just transfer the damn call.
Kevin| Your call is very important to us. Ple-
Andy| Hey-o! 
Dwight| Way to go.
Andy| My maid died.
Pam| Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And were starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.  Look, its official! 
Michael| Oh, good. My hookers here.  Hi.
Pam| Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Michael| Yes I was. Yes I was.
Pam| Are you wearing anything under the robe?
Michael| That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Pam| This looks great, Michael.
Michael| Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Pam| Yes, please.
Michael| What shape?
Pam| ... Square is fine.
Michael| Alright. 
Charles| Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michaels replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns.  Yeah.
Kelly| Where will you be staying while youre in Scranton?
Charles| Eh, uh, in a hotel.
Angela| Charles, where were you born?
Charles| Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay.  Yeah.
Andy| How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Charles| Okay, lets go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys?  Thank you. So, umm...
Jim|  Would you please stop that?
Dwight| What?
Jim| Youre breathing very heavily.
Dwight| This is how I breathe.
Jim| No its not.
Dwight| If you want to tell me -
Charles| Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Jim| Oh no. I was just - 
Charles| No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes".
Jim| ... Yes.
Charles| Good. As I was saying...
Dwight| Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! 
Pam| So, what do you say we get started?
Michael| After breakfast.
Pam| Im full.
Michael| So how you feeling about the new company?
Pam| I feel good.  Wow.
Michael| You excited? About the new company?
Pam| Yeah. Im excited to start the company.
Michael| After breakfast.
Pam| We did that. So, whats next? Michael, just stop for a second.  Michael. Stop for a second.
Michael| No, Im whipping them.
Pam| No, I know you are.
Michael| Just let go. 
Pam| Just let me have... Oh.
Michael| Let go, please. Just gimmee - 
Pam| Fine!  Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry.
Michael| I cant do this! This is pathetic, isnt it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
Phyllis| I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Stanley| I dont think he even uses the bathroom.
Creed| Oh, he does. He does.
Michael|  I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Pam| You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed - 
Michael| Im not overwhelmed, Pam.
Pam| I know! No, Im saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff. 
Micheal| Whatever calms you down.
Pam| Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.  Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Michael| Dont patronize me, Pam.
Pam| I think you should get dressed.
Michael| Im not getting dressed. Im not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Pam| Michael, that seems impossible.
Michael| Its totally impossible!
Pam| We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Michael| Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Pam| Great.
Michael| Okay, Ryan.
Pam| No. What? Why?
Michael| Hes everything Im not and everything I am. Hes the whole package.
Pam| No. Were not gonna hire Ryan. 
Michael| Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman Ive ever met.
Pam| Okay.
Michael| He worked at that telemarketing place.
Pam| Well find him. 
Michael| Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Pam| Really? 
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| We have an investor already?
Michael| Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Pam| Michael, thats fantastic.
Michael| Yeah, I guess its not so bad. Got a few things cookin.  Umm...
Pam| Hey! We need to get you dressed!
Pam| I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. Thats one thing Ive learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.  Hey! You look great!  Lets go!
Michael| Alright.
Andy| 
Charles| You a soccer fan?
Andy| Oh. Oh my God. Im so embarrassed. You werent supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession. 
Charles| Well, that makes two of us.
Andy| No way!
Charles| Yeah.
Andy| I hate soccer. But guess who doesnt hate soccer? Charles Miner.
Charles| I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Andy| Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Charles| Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Andy| Cool!
Jim| Ive never been a kiss up. I - its just not how I operate. I mean, Ive always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
Pam| Next on the list - open the mail. 
Michael| Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
Pam| No, okay. Its fine. Its fine. Were just gonna add "find office"...
Michael| How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Pam| Next on the list --  song parodies.
Michael| Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
Pam| Great. Lets sing it in the car.
Michael| No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs. 
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| We can do this.
Pam| We can do this.
Andy| Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom".  Goal!
Charles| Yep. Yep. Thats Pele.
Andy| You know your soccer, man.
Charles| I know. Yes I do.
Stanley| I prefer  Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Charles| Oh yeah? 
Stanley| From Argentina.
Charles| I didnt know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Andy| I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Charles| What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Jim| Uh, no. Nope. Not really. 
Charles| Well, its not for everybody I suppose. 
Jim| Its cause Im more of a player.
Charles| Yeah?
Jim| You bet.
Dwight| Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. Cause you never, ever talk about it. 
Jim| Well I do.
Dwight| Wow.
Jim| I play.
Dwight| You can be so modest sometimes.
Jim| Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Dwight|  Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Jim| Maybe we will someday.
Dwight| Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Charles| Thats a great idea, Dwight.
Dwight| Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. 
Jim| Yeah. 
Dwight| I dont try and be anything that Im not.
Charles| What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Dwight| Jim, what do you say?
Angela| Sounds fun.
Andy| Im in it to win.
Dwight| Game on!
Charles| Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Jim| Lets... eh... see ya.
Charles| See you on the field. Ha, ha. I cant wait!
Jim| Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Pam|  We got Vikram!
Vikram| You got me.
Vikram| Where are we going?
Pam| We have a meeting with an investor today.
Michael| Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If youll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
Vikram| He seems really confident.
Pam| He can be. 
Vikram| Confidence. Its the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool. 
Pam| Hm. Im looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Michael| Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  Its Michael.
Ryan| Im swamped, Michael.  Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Michael| Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Vikram| Hes taking a long time. Is it possible hes bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do. 
Pam| Yes. Yes, its possible.
Michael| Well, it has always been a lifelong dream. 
Pam| Michael! Whats going on?
Michael| Im...
Pam| Hey, Ryan.
Ryan| Hey, you.
Michael| Excuse me. Yes?
Pam| This wasnt on the list.
Michael| Yes, it is.
Pam| No.
Michael| Yes.
Pam| Its not.
Michael| It is.
Pam|  When did you add this to the list?
Michael| Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Ryan| Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Pam| You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Ryan| What do you make, secretary?
Supervisor| Back to work, shoe bitch!
Ryan| I told you guys, Im really busy here, so...
Michael| Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Ryan| What size shoes are you guys?
Michael| Uh, nine.
Ryan| What are those, a mens ten?
Pam| No.
Michael|  Look what hes doing.
Pam| What is he doing?
Michael| Hes stealing them. Okay, okay.
Pam| Oh my God.
Michael| Hes already paying for himself.
Pam| Sorry!
Ryan| Where is it?
Michael| Right here.
Vikram| Hey, cmon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.
Charles| Miner - 
Jim| Oh, there he goes.
Charles| ...sees his partner - 
Jim| Yikes.
Charles| Halpert. He looks up! 
Jim| Aw, man.
Charles| Defending duo! He sets him up!  He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Jim| Oh! Goal!
Charles| Aw, man, I cant wait to play with you.
Jim| Aw, its gonna be the  worst.
Ryan| Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Michael| Oh yeah.
Pam| Sure.
Ryan| It was indescribable.
Michael| Sounds awesome.
Pam| Beat.
Vikram| What sort of investing club is this?
Michal| Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
Pam|  Nana?
Nana| Michael!
Michael| People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nanas investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then Im sure thats what she would have wanted. Does want.
Michael| Well Im sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Nana| So lets hear it.
Michael| Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Nana| How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
Michael| By wanting it more. By working hard- 
Nana| Whats your mission statement?
Michael| Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee. 
Charles| Cmon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Dwight| Wing. 
Kevin| Wag.
Charles| Jim. What do you play?
Jim| Left.
Charles| Forward or half?
Jim| Forward, definitely.
Chares| Okay, striker, huh?
Jim| Striker!
Charles| Lets see what you got in those legs!
Jim| Alright! Lets do it.
Charles| Alright.  No, no, no. Thats supposed to be the kickoff.
Jim| Kickoff.  My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.  Alright! 
Michael| And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana| Michael, I dont know about this.
Michael| Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Nana| Im not so sure.
Michael| Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We dont - it doesnt have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Nana| See, this is what concerns me. 
Old Woman| We could just give him a chance. Its not much money.
Michael| Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for. 
Nana| This isnt a handout club. Its an investment club!
Michael| Okay.
Nana| I love you, Michael. I do.
Michael| Okay.
Nana| But no. I mean it. No.
Vikram| I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
Pam| It means grandmother.
Vikram| Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, Im sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?
Vikram| You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- 
Andy| Get im, Jim! Cmon, tough D, Jim. 
Charles| Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Oscar| Phyllis, Phyllis.
Charles| Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Phyllis|  No, I swallowed a crown.
Charles| Whyd you duck, Jim?
Jim| What?
Dwight| Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Jim| Okay, Im just gonna go get some ice.
Charles| Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Jim| Im sorry, Phyllis.
Charles| Oh, yeah. Jims sorry.
Ryan| Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Michael| Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We dont have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that. 
Pam| I cant do this.
Michael| Whats that?
Pam| I cant do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle. 
Michael| Blech.
Pam| I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Michael| Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And thats why God made so many.
Pam| We dont have any money. We dont have an office. We dont have anything.
Michael| Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, lets get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
Pam| How come out of everyone in the office, Im the only one that went with you? Is it because Im that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesnt even believe in you!
Michael| I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. Thats what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... thats it. Thats our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people dont believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So Im gonna go inside. Im going to make some calls, Im gonna get us an office space, and Im going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? 
Michael| You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. Theres gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating. 
Michael| I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. Thats what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Dont think a woman can be a man? Well, then thats your stereotype, not mine. 
Michael|  Okay.
Pam| I could work here. I could see this. 
Michael| Its right in the middle of the paper belt.
Pam| Are you good?
Michael| Yeah, Im good. You good?
Pam| Im good.
Michael| You know what they say, keep your friends close. 
Charles| Michael, youre back.
Michael| Yes, I am, Charles.
Charles| Mmmhmm.
Michael| Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. Were gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
