Dwight|  Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause. 
Michael|  I like it.
Dwight|  Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Jim|   I dont know. Is it classy enough?
Dwight|  Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Jim|  I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Michael|  I think youre right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
Jim|  And of course, classy.
Michael|  And classy, yeah.
Dwight|  Michael, youre just agreeing with him because hes wearing a tux. Dont you see what hes doing here? 
Jim|  Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that Im taking it very seriously. 
Dwight|  Oh, heres one  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. 
Michael|   You know, thats good but its not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Jim|  Thats it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Michael|  Yes.
Dwight|  Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Michael|  He is.
Dwight|  He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Michael|  Thats what makes him classy.
Dwight|  Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Jim|  Oh, Dwight, youre trying too hard, and thats just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is its a state of mind. 
Dwight|  Well, Im sorry, I just dont know what classy is then.
Jim|  Ok, well lets just try this one on for size. And I apologize because its right off the top of my head  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Michael|  Strawberries?
Jim|  Thats inspired.
Dwight|  I said that! 
Pam|  Not classy.
Michael|  Not classy at all.
Jim|  De class√©.
Michael|  French. Classy.
Pam|  Hi, can I help you?
Charles|  Yeah, Im Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Pam|  Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat. 
Michael|   Yes?
Pam|  Michael, theres a Charles Miner here to see you.
Michael|  Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Pam|  Yeah, are you coming out now?
Michael|  Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is.
Charles|  I-I was-
Michael|  Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? Cmon, here we go, dont be shy, dont be shy, youre one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Jim|  Hey.
Michael|  Yes.
Jim|  Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Michael|  What? No, I didnt want to make everybody nervous.
Jim|  Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Michael|  You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Dwight|  Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvanias largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Michael|  Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Lets go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Dwight|  Well finish it up later, but essentially what were talking about is...
Michael|  Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from Os into Cs, for Charles. 
Charles|  Thank you.
Michael|  Took me all night.
Pam|  This is what you did last night?
Michael|  I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each others vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  Its gonna be mental! Its going to be mental.
Kelly|  My god, hes like a black George Clooney.
Angela|  Really? I dont see it. I mean, hes ok, hes not unattractive, its. . . 
Jim|  Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Charles|  Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Jim|  I didnt think youd notice.  Uh, its funny actually, theres another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. 
Charles|  Uh.
Jim|  Oh, youd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, theres probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Charles|  Your name is Jim?
Jim|  Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... 
Pam|  He just had to wear his tux today.
Jim|  I thought itd be funny.
Pam|  Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Michael|  All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. Id like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department. 
Charles|  Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Michael|  Oh, nerd alert! 
Kevin|  Ni-
Michael|  This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didnt bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that. 
Charles|  Hey, Oscar, its good to meet you.
Michael|  This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange 
Andy|  Hey-o!
Michael|  There you go! Wheres the other?
Charles|  You know, Michael, I dont need to know everyones sexual history.
Michael|  Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history. 
Kevin|  Hey!
Charles|  How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Michael|  Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. 
Charles|  Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Michael|  Oh! Well...
Charles|  Thats great.
Michael|  Above and beyond.
Charles|  Hey, you know were in tough times and were not immune to this economy.
Michael|  Thats true.
Charles|  But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Stanley|   Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Michael|  No. Absolutely not.
Charles|  Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we cant make any promises, but well try everything in our power to avoid that.
Oscar|  Do you have specifics?
Charles|  Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Michael|  Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didnt want to worry people.
Charles|  You didnt tell them.
Michael|  Well, why dont-
Charles|  Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Michael|  Charles is going to tell you.
Charles|  Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office. 
Stanley|  Fantastic.
Michael|  Well, its not official.
Charles|  It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, Im encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Michael|  Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Charles|  No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Michael|  Well-
Dwight|  What about your party? 
Michael|  Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesnt it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work. 
Charles|  Michael, Im going to stay for the day.
Michael|  Oh no, no, no. You dont have to do that. Ive got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet. 
Charles|  No, its a little bit more than that. Im going to set up in here, ok?
Michael|  I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that Im supposed to have. Thrilled.
Michael|   David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
David|  What gave you that idea?
Michael|  It was my understanding. 
David|  I see.
Michael|  Listen, why dont we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability. 
David|  Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team. 
Michael|  But the branch is still mine?
David|  Youre still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know. 
Dwight|  Ask him about the party.
Michael|  Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party? 
David|  Ill give it my best shot, Michael.
Dwight|  No the other thing.
Michael|  Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? 
Dwight|  He hung up?
David|  No.
Michael|  I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that youve never told anybody before.
Charles|  No. 
Michael|  Come on. Whats your wifes name? Where did you work before you came here?
Charles|  Saticoy Steel.
Michael|  Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. 
Charles|  No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Michael|  Youre not from paper?
Charles|  No.
Michael|  Does David know this?
Charles|  Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager. 
Michael|  Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
Charles|  And what is that?
Michael|  And that- I-I dont need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, its all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Charles|  Thats not how I plan on doing things.
Michael|  Ok, alright, well Ill just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Charles|  Ill tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way. 
Michael|  Whatever David wants.
Charles|  Ok.
Michael|   Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
Dwight|  Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm em. 
Stephanie|  David Wallaces office.
Dwight|  Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Stephanie|  Good. Thank you.
Dwight|  Hows it hanging?
Stephanie|  Alright. . .
Dwight|  Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, Ive got David Wallaces son in the trunk of my car. If he doesnt get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Michael|  No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.   
Stephanie|  David Wallaces office.
Michael|  Hi Stephanie, its Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the sons going to be returned, everythings fine. 
Stephanie|  Michael...
Michael|  And I really really need to talk to David.
Stephanie|  Please hold.
Charles|   Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Michael|  I was never given a name. 
Pam|   Uh, hi, can I help you? I dont think anyone here-
Charles|  Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Angela|  That is so unnecessary!
Michael|  Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
Charles|  Its no big deal.
Michael|  I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Charles|  You still have that option. 
Angela|  Thanks again, Charles.
Kelly|  Thank you.
Michael|  Nobody thanked me.
Jim|  Thanks, Charles.
Michael|  For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think its a little hypercritical. 
Charles|  I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Michael|   Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
Kelly|  Should I seduce him?
Angela|  No. No one wants to see that. 
Kevin|  Michael?
Michael|  Yep. 
Kevin|  I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Michael|  Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Charles|  Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? Were going to need you to do that during office hours.
Kevin|  Ok.
Charles|  Ok.
Michael|  Kevin? This is my branch. You dont ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Charles|  Thats not the way its gonna work.
Michael|   Yes it is!
Charles|  No, it is not.  
Michael|  No, it is not.
Charles|   Ok, so were on the same page, great.
Michael|  Ok, so were on the same page, great.
Charles|  Ok, Michael, what are you doing? 
Michael|  Ok, Michael, what are you doing? 
Charles|  No, seriously.
Michael|  No, seriously.
Charles|  How old are you?
Michael|  How old are you?
Pam|  Oh no.
Pam|  I can tell Michaels mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Charles|  Five years old?
Michael|  Five years old?
Andy|  Duuudes, stop.
Employees|   Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. Youre going to get all of us in trouble.
Charles|  I will walk away.
Michael|  Im gonna walk away.
Andy|  Stop doing that!
Michael|  Im kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, its just a joke. Its fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, lets continue our morning meeting in the conference room. 
Pam|  And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one. 
Michael|  What is that smaller stripper holding?
Pam|  Cupcake. Its cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Michael|  Ok. 
Charles|  What exactly is the PPC?
Phyllis|  Oh, thats the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
Charles|  Excuse me, guys. Whats going on in here?
Michael|  Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Charles|  This doesnt seem like a good way to spend company time.
Michael|  Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jims? Go ahead.
Jim|  No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please. 
Charles|  Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Jim|  You pet the animals and they pet you back. 
Michael|  Its a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
Pam|  Its really just a regular shaped cake.
Michael|  But its cool, and its-
Charles|  This isnt a good use of company time, Michael.
Michael|   Whoa. Youre talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Charles|  Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Michael|  Yeah, why dont you do that? 
Charles|   Thank you very much.
Michael|  Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Charles|  Ok, Michael, Im dissolving this committee. 
Michael|  What?
Charles|  Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isnt designed for your vanity.
Michael|  Newsflash  Ive been here for fifteen years. Headline  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Charles|  I dont know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Michael|  Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? Im going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  Im going to tell him everything. And Im sorry to say, youre screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And Im sorry. Im sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? Its not like steel. You dont put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? Youd ruin it. 
Charles|   Come in.
Jim|  Hey. 
Charles|  Hey.
Jim|  Alright, Charles, Ive gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, Im a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Charles|  Number two?
Jim|  Second-in-command to Michael.  
Charles|  Oh, I didnt know that position existed.
Jim|  Oh, thats because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Charles|  So youre the assistant to the regional manager?
Jim|  Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Charles|  Any responsibilities come with it?
Jim|   No, not exactly.
Charles|  So you keep this made up position? Its important to you? 
Jim|  Alright, I will, um, Im just gonna let you get back to that.
Charles|  Yeah, would you, uh?
Jim|  Yep. 
Michael|  Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? 
David|   Michael. 
Michael|   So is this the meeting youve been in all day?
David|  How did you get here, Michael?
Michael|  I drove.
David|  Ok. 
Michael|  Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. Ive already bought em. And I dont have a place to store them. So, I feel like Ive been sort of boned.
David|  Michael. Listen-
Michael|  Do you talk to him about this? Youve talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
David|  Well, I didnt know about the figs, specifically. . .
Michael|  Ok. Then I dont get it. It doesnt make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
David|  Thats not exactly-
Michael|  Clearly thats what you wanted. 
David|  No.
Michael|  Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot. 
David|  Yes.
Michael|  Ive put having a family on hold. 
David|  We didnt ask you to do that. 
Michael|  And Ive never gone hang-gliding.  And Ive never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington. 
Charles|  Ok. Nice meeting everyone. Ill see you in a couple of weeks. 
Andy|  Cool.
Dwight|  Excellent.
Angela|  It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. 
Jim|  See ya. See ya.  Bye!
Jim|  And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear. 
Kelly|  I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but its so worth it, you guys.
Phyllis|  Its just me here.
Kelly|  I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight. 
Phyllis|  I think he left.
Kelly|  What?! Move! 
Angela|   Hello, Charles? Charles!
Kelly|  Hey! Is that his scarf?
Angela|  No! 
Angela|   Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Michael|  I dont understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesnt seem right to me. That doesnt seem fair. And I think that Ive earned more than that.
David|  Yeah. Youre right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Heres what Im going to do-
Michael|  Ok.
David|  We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. Its gonna be great. Hows that? 
Michael|   I quit. 
David|  What?
Michael|  You have no idea how high I can fly. 
Andy|  Im telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual. 
Meredith|  Ok, what do you think?
Oscar|  Well, its-
Andy|  Why are you asking him? I just told you why hes here.
Creed|  The real question here is whos this guy work for? 
Oscar|  Dunder Mifflin. 
Creed|  Ah, its all starting to make sense now.
