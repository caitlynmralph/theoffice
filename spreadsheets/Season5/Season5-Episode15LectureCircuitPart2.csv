Michael| I am on a lecture circuit. Im goin around to all the branches, and Im telling them my secret recipe for success.
Michael| I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
Michael|  And I turn it on and I say Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.
Karen| Hows Jim?
Pam| Were engaged.
Karen| Oh my God, Im so happy for you!
Pam| Oh, wow, thank you!
Michael| You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? Shes the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Pam| ... Okay, lets go. 
Oscar|  Two?
Kevin| I didnt eat lunch.  I didnt eat all my lunch.
Angela|  Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Kevin| It... yeah.
Oscar| Angela, youre more chipper than usual.
Angela| I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family.  Shes hypoallergenic. She doesnt struggle when you try to dress her. Shes a third-generation show cat. Her father was in Meet the Parents. Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Meredith| How much?
Angela| Seven thousand dollars.
Creed| For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
Oscar| Whered you get that kind of money?
Angela| I sold Andys engagement ring on eBay.
Kevin| Wait, you didnt give it back?
Angela| He wouldnt have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Meredith| Seven grand?
Angela| Mm-hmm.
Meredith| I gotta see that little bitch.
Angela| I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Oscar| You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
Angela| Yeah.  I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but Im out of vacation days. And this company still doesnt recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Meredith| Shes right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Angela| Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
Kevin| Any cat, you mean.
Angela| And person.
Pam| So, detour. Were now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I dont think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!   Ive been driving too long. 
Dwight|  What did you do?
Kelly| Stop yelling at me!
Dwight| What did you do?
Kelly| I didnt do anything!
Dwight| What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Jim| Hey! What the hells goin on?
Dwight| Why dont you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
Kelly| I was kickin it.
Dwight| In juvie.
Jim| What?
Dwight| Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Jim| Yep.
Dwight| For reha-
Jim| Got it. 
Dwight| What did you do? Huh?
Jim| Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. 
Dwight| Yeah, if shes old enough to get married, shes old enough to follow the law.  What did you do?
Kelly| My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his fathers. And I just thought itd be really romantic, like Thelma and Louise, but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I cant believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Dwight| I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Jim| Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Kelly| You did? I wanna see the cake.
Jim| And... ta da.
Kelly| I hate it.
Jim| How do you hate it? Its a cake.
Kelly| Well, theres no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, theres nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesnt have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
Jim| Right. 
Jim| I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still dont know.
Kelly| I mean, I dont even know what the theme is. Whats the theme?!
Jim| Birthday.
Dwight| Frosting.
Kelly| Those arent... themes. Theres always a theme. 
Phyllis| Theres always a theme.
Dwight| Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
Jim| Okay, you know what, next time, Ill let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Pam|  Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
Michael| Do I look okay?
Pam| You look good.
Michael| Hi.
Receptionist| Hi, can I help you?
Michael| Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
Receptionist| Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat. 
Michael| Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
Receptionist| Actually, shes on an HR retreat for the next three days.
Michael| Oh- Shes not here?
Receptionist| But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. Hes a salesman here.
Michael| A.J.
Receptionist| Yeah, hes her boyfriend. Hes just over there.
Michael| She has a boyfriend.
Pam| Im so sorry, Michael.
Michael| How could she do this to me, Pam?
Pam| Shes not doing it to hurt you.
Michael| I cant do the presentation, I cant-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! 
Pam| Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didnt want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
Michael| I know, just... uh, please, Im going through something, okay? 
Pam| You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then shell realize what shes missing.
Michael| And then shell move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
Pam| Yeah, maybe.
Michael| 
Pam| Maybe. One step at a time.
Michael| 
Pam| You can do this.
Michael| I can do this.
Oscar| It could be snacks, or- 
Kevin| Why would we- 
Oscar| Wha-
Kevin| Is that what I think it is? 
Oscar| Good God!
Kevin| 
Oscar| 
Angela| 
Kevin| That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Angela| No!
Meredith| Awesome!
Angela| Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
Meredith| Yeah, I know fixed; that aint fixed.
Kevin| No way.
Angela| No, now listen. You cant let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats.  I gotta go. Ill be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Kevin|  Oh, the other ones watching.
Jim| Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Dwight| Busy!
Jim| Hey, whats that show that shes always talking about?
Dwight| Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
Jim| You know what? I could use a little help.
Dwight| You know what? Im a little busy.
Jim| We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what youve been doing, is making a sign?
Dwight| Its not effeminate. Its festive.
Jim| Youve been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the partys now at 3!
Stanley| I know, I just read it on the sign.
Michael| Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Lets see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, youre a salesman. Whats, uh, whats your name?
A.J.| A.J.
Michael| A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
A.J.| 
Michael| What do you race cars?
A.J.|  Im a salesman. Thats why I raised my hand.
Michael| Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. Youre funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
A.J.| Yeah. Why, are you interested? 
Woman| I have a question about discounts from distributors.
Michael| Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so youre dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
A.J.| Its pretty serious, yes.
Michael| Huh-  Does she ever talk about me? 
Pam| Oh, God.
A.J.| Excuse me?
Man| What does this have to do with sales?
Michael| Its all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention Michael Scott?
A.J.| No, what are you talking about?
Michael|  Does it feel good?
A.J.| Does what feel good?
Michael|  Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so lets just- Well just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay.
Pam| Michael, get off the floor!
Michael| Yeah, yeah... uh, I cant do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. 
Pam|  No, no, no, you have to do it-
Michael| No, no, Im okay. Im all right.  Okay... okay.
Pam| That was weird, huh? Its all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  Im just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that Im going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor youre gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Pam|  Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Hollys boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw!  Cutting down the competition.
Angela|  Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, Im looking for Mr. Ash. Hes a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. Cause Im talking to you right now. 
Oscar| 
Kevin| 
Angela| 
Kevin| This is getting weird.
Oscar| Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? 
Kevin| Ohhh...
Michael| 
Angela|   Has this been on the entire time?
Oscar| I have no idea. 
Kevin| I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Angela|  Well, sorry Im late. 
Oscar| I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, Im pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Pam|  Dont look up. Dont look up. 
Michael| Want some pie?
Pam| No.
Michael| I went through Hollys things.
Pam| What?
Michael| I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
Pam| Oh, Michael...
Michael| I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
Pam| You did what?
Michael| I shouldnt have done it. It just- I couldnt help it.
Pam| She never sent it to you?
Michael| No, sh- she didnt. Im gonna read it.
Pam| No.
Michael| Yes. 
Pam| No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. Its a violation of her trust.
Michael| How?
Pam| Because, she didnt send it to you!
Michael| I know, I know. Youre right, youre right.
Pam| I could read it.
Michael| No, that wouldnt-
Pam| Yeah, I could read it.
Michael| No, you dont have to do that. 
Pam| Go get your laptop.
Michael| Okay. 
Pam|  What? Im not in love with her.
Dwight|  You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Jim| Im not writing, "Horse Hunt." I dont even know what that means.
Dwight| Its in the name.
Jim|  Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Dwight| Youre right, forget horse hunting. Its stupid.
Jim| Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Dwight| Heres one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like Id never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. 
Jim| Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. Thats disgusting, and it doesnt count. So give me another one.
Dwight| Schrutes dont celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year.  What about you?
Jim| Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Dwight| Thats cool. Hey, you know whats even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Jim|  Didnt see that one coming.
Pam|  Its deleted.
Michael| Well?
Pam| She still has feelings for you.
Michael| She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Pam| I cant tell you specifically, but... its not over. 
Michael| Youre sure? 
Pam| 
Michael|  Okay.
Kelly| 
All| Happy Birthday!
Meredith| Surprise!
Dwight| Hey, its not a surprise.
Jim| Not a surprise.
Kelly| This doesnt look good.
Jim| What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Kelly| 
Dwight| Told you.
Jim| You havent heard our theme, though.
Kelly| You dont hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
Jim| Thats the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Dwight| Our theme, if you will.
Jim| Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Dwight| Thats our theme.
Kelly| Cool. 
Jim| Yeah?
Kelly| I love it.
Dwight|  Oh, yes! Okay, good. So whats it gonna be, Kapoor?
Kevin| Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Dwight| No.
Jim| No.
Kevin| Oh, then pick TV.
Meredith| Take a nap!
Oscar| TV.
Kevin| No, watching TV at work is really cool.
Stanley| Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
Creed| Bonnie Hunt is on.
Kelly| You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
Jim| All right.
Dwight| Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! Were gonna be eating cake at our desks. Lets go. 
Meredith| Surprise.
Dwight| Move it! Lets go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Jim| Ahem. This is for you... and  ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Kelly|  Thank you.
Dwight|  Okay, youve got one hour. 
Kelly| Im too excited to sleep.
Dwight| Mm, great cake.
Jim| Thanks. 
Dwight|  Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.  Many happy returns. 
Michael| I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Pam| No, we dont need to do that.
Michael| Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
Pam| You mean Tony?
Michael| Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Pam| Oh, Michael.
Michael| Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty. 
Angela| As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. Its been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of Gods most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! Its tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Kevin|  For a rainy day.
