Receptionist| Pam, line three.
Pam| Okay, thanks.
Pam| New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Pam| Hey.
Michael | Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
Pam| Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Pam| Hey Michael.
Michael | Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
Michael| Hey.
Holly| Hello.
Michael| That was really fun last night.
Holly| Yeah, it was nice.
Michael| Im actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Holly| Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Michael| Yeah?
Holly| Yeah.
Michael| Oh really?
Holly| Yeah.
Michael| Well...
Holly| It would help.
Michael| I, uh...  I let her win.
Holly|  No, he didnt.
Michael| So, when, um, can I see you again?
Holly| Um, tonight, Im free tonight. Is that too eager?
Michael| No.
Holly| I dont care, free tonight.
Michael| Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonights no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
Holly|  Oh, I just remembered, I cant tonight.
Michael|  Why?
Holly| Im going out with you.
Michael| Wow... Oh, wait a second, I cant tonight...
Holly|  No more.
Michael| Tonights so...
Holly| No more.
Michael| Too many times. Its all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
Holly| Thank you, you too.
Michael| Youre welcome.
Michael| In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I dont know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me Ill know for sure.
Andy| Thats for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. Cause thats what I wrote on your save-the-date.
Dwight|  You set a date?
Andy| J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
Phyllis|  What are you making?
Dwight| A knife.
Phyllis| Youre making a knife with a knife?
Dwight| You got a better way?
Phyllis| You want to talk about it?
Dwight| About what?
Phyllis| You know I know.  You know they know.
Dwight| I know none of that. If I did, youd be the last to know.
Holly| Oh, the mall could be fun.
Michael| Yeah.
Holly| We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Michael| Some of what we order depends on whether were having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think were going to have sex tonight?
Holly| ...Hell yeah.
Michael| Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... Well just do the restaurant thing first.
Holly| Yeah, thats good.
Michael| Probably get soup or something light.
Phyllis| Hi.
Dwight| She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Phyllis| Its nice to learn new things.
Dwight| I was talking to myself.
Phyllis| Okay.
Dwight| I just dont get it.
Phyllis| What dont you get?
Dwight| Why is she marrying Andy?
Phyllis| Angelas not really a risk taker. And Andys not really a risk.
Dwight| Thats really fattening.
Phyllis| No, its lettuce.
Holly|  Its time to go.
Michael| No. No. Reservations are at 800, so weve got like an hour and 45 minutes.   Im a crazy eight, Im crazy.
Holly| Youre crazy, go crazy.
Holly|  Oh, I forgot my keys.
Michael| Do you need em?
Holly| Yeah, lets go grab them.
Michael| All right.
Holly| Oh, after vous.
Michael| Thank vous.  What? Oh!
Holly| I didnt forget my keys, I just didnt want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Michael| Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they cant hear us at all.
Holly| Oh, good.
Michael| Were totally alone.
Angela| Yes, thats correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
Oscar| Great, they stole my laptop.
Kevin| Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
Oscar| How does that even compare?
Kevin| Oscar, Im now going to be prone to surges.
Michael| Oh, my God, what happened?
Jim| We were robbed last night.
Dwight| Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And thats all we have.
Holly| Can I talk to you for a second?
Michael| Yeah. Oh... oh!
Holly| That wasnt us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Michael| No, did you?
Holly| Michael I think this is our fault.
Michael| Oh, no, my God.
Holly| Oh...
Michael| Oh my God!
Michael| So much for sex without consequences.
Pam |  You are such a dork! Shots!
Jim| So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 300 in the morning.
Pam | Im not drunk.
Jim| Im on minute six of this message.
Pam | Okay, I do not sound like that.
Man on phone| You can take the girl out of Philly...
Pam | Scranton.
Jim| The future mother of my children.
Angela| I never felt safe here.
Andy| Youre always safe with me. Im a very good screamer. And one day, were going to move to Disneys Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
Angela| I would very much like that.
Andy| Yeah?
Angela| Yeah.
Andy|  Consider yourself... at home!
Dwight|  Ugh.
Dwight| Get in.
Phyllis| Where are we going?
Dwight| I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
Phyllis| Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
Dwight| Are you sure thats going to work?
Phyllis| It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Dwight| Wait, this isnt our floor. Dwight...
Holly| Hows everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Oscar| I dont want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Creed| Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name?  Creed Bratton.
Michael| Were gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
Michael| To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. Im calling it crime-aid. Its like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
Phyllis| I think its a fun idea.
Michael| Thank you.
Phyllis| We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Michael| Okay, Im gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didnt get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Phyllis| Move on, Michael.
Michael| Okay. Okay! Well, come on, lets have an auction. Lets do this. Well auction off people like in the olden days.
Oscar| So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we dont want. Who would ever come to this?
Michael| I dont know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. Theres a point there. But what is the point? I dont understand what hes saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, its not a little foggy theres actually something going on here-
Jim| Do you need us for any of this?
Michael| Do I?
Holly| Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Michael| Yeah, I think thats pretty boss.
Holly| He knows how to get things. He got me.
Michael| Whoa!
Holly|  Sorry.
Michael| Twice. ... Right?
Holly| Mm-hmm.
Michael| Mm-hmm.
Holly| Mm-hmm.
Dwight| Listen to me close. Cause Im only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
Angela| I think you have me confused with another person.
Dwight| I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 614 PM. 614!
Angela| I heard you.
Michael| Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.  And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.  Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? Youre auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
Darryl| Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
Michael| Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars.  300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400- Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450  Sold! For 300 dollars to me!  What the hell is that?
Phyllis| Its the only gavel I could find.
Michael| It squeaks when you bang it, thats what she said. Lets hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Darryl| Hey Mike, do my thing.
Michael| Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, Im actually going to bid on this. Im going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
Darryl| Mike, you cant do that. Its conflict of interest.
Jim| 5 dollars.
Darryl| Sold! To Jim.
Michael| Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you dont win it. It just says "Creed."

Phyllis| Why couldnt have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Dwight| Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Phyllis| Now you move on.
Dwight| Okay, fine. Ive moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Phyllis| Well Dwight, I dont think you do. I think youve got your answer.
Dwight| Wait, thats it? Thats your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Phyllis| Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Dwight| Oh. I get it. Youre trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. Youre just being selfish.  And you slap like a girl.
Dwight| What did Phyllis do wrong? Ill tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.
Roy| Whats going on with Pam?
Jim| Oh, shes good actually.

Michael|  Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. Its sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-
Holly| The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far its all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
David Wallace|  No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
