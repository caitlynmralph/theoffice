Kelly|  Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Phyllis|  Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Kelly| Oh, Im Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Phyllis| Mm. I like your shoes.
Kelly| Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Phyllis| Sure.
Ryan| I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Kelly| Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Ryan| Gordon Gekko.
Kelly| Oh, from the insurance commercials!
Ryan| ... Yeah.
Oscar|   Whoa. Awesome.
Creed| Lets put a smile on that face!
Kevin|  Dammit Creed! Ive been up since four!
Andy|  Meow. Sweet stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Jim| Dave.
Andy| Cool.
Jim| You are?   A cat?
Andy|  We were looking for "kitten."
Jim|  Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Pam| Thanks.  My costumes getting a lot of attention.
Pam| So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I cant even take off my hat, because then Im Hitler.
Dwight|  Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! Im gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh!  Disappear.
Michael| Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cats Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
Holly| Oh, look at all this stuff! Its only seven hours.
Michael| When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Holly| Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Michael| Road trip!  Right?
Holly| Breaker one-nine, copy?
Michael| Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
Darryl| Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
Michael| Were not.
Holly| Kidding.
Michael| Were not doing anything.
Holly| Its been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said "Well, why dont you quit and get some job in Nashua?" And he said "I asked you first."  And I said "First!" at the same time he did. And then I said "Jinx." And then we never talked about it again and havent been back to the conversation. So...
Michael| All right everybody. Im out of here. Jim, youre in charge.
Jim| Oh, Ill walk you out.
Michael| Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
Michael| You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
Jim| All right. Well see.  No.
Jim| I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Dwight| Good morning temp.
Ryan| Morning.  Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Dwight| Thought Id go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Andy| Ha ha ha. Thats funny.  Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Dwight| Andy.
Andy| Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if youre not a Cornell man, you probably shouldnt wear them.
Dwight| No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, Im applying!
Andy| Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
Dwight| Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
Phyllis| Im sitting right here Dwight.
Dwight| I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Dwight| Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.
Holly| I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Michael| Cool!
Darryl| Mike youll drive this every weekend?
Michael| Were gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes well just meet in the middle. Itll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
Michael and Holly| Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.
Michael, Holly, and Darryl| If youre going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If youre going my way...
Dwight| Hey there. So uh, how do you think were gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Fords arm looks pretty strong.
Andy| Well hes had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, youre just doing this to screw with me.
Dwight| Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldnt have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Andy| I know its an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
Dwight| Someday, well both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Pam| Hey!
Tom| Hey, future baby sis!
Pam| How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
Tom| Im good.
Pam| I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think theyre into the idea. Theyre probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, shes the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. Shes the best! The absolute best."
Pam| Okay, so heres what Im thinking. Im gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasnt in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
Pete| Thats perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Tom| Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!
Pete| That, is awesome!
Tom| Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.
Pete| Oh yeah.
Pam| So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
Pete|  I think this is better.
Tom| The other thing would "get" Jim.
Pete| This is nicer, its fun. Its fun!
Pam| Okay, okay.
Tom| Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.
Pam| Oookay....
Pam| They came up with that idea really fast.
Darryl| This trip was longer than I thought.
Holly| Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Michael| Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!   Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
Holly| You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
Michael| Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
Darryl| Not really.
Michael| All right. Whats the scoop, how far?
Darryl| Four hours. Almost halfway there.
Holly| Were only halfway?
Michael| Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
Darryl| Next exit isnt for five miles.
Holly| Lets check there.
Pam| Hey guys.
Jim| Hey, how are you?
Pam| Hi!
Jim| Good to see you.
Pete| Nice to see you again, Pam.
Tom| Pam, I havent seen you in so, so long!
Jim| All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Darryl| Theres nothing out here man.
Michael| Yeah. I dont know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Michael| Here we go, fourth times a charm. "Lifes like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you dont, sometimes you do, what you want... theres a world out there....  Hey. Are you crying?
Holly| No.
Michael| Allergies?
Holly| No.
Michael| Did Darryl touch you?
Darryl| WHAT!?
Holly| No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?
Michael| Whats the matter?
Holly| Its not gonna work.
Michael| Sure it is.
Holly| Theres too much distance.
Michael| Oh no no no.. Its gonna work, itll be fine.
Holly| Michael weve only been dating each other for a few weeks
Michael| Listen to me. I like you so much.
Holly| And I like you too.
Michael| And Ive dated four women in the last--
Holly| Ive dated four guys last year too.
Michael| Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
Holly| Oh.
Michael| Ive dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
Holly| Michael. Dont. Dont. Dont make it harder than it has to be.
Michael| Thats what she said.
Michael| Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. Im gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
Andy| Take that down.
Dwight| Excuse me?
Andy| Take. That down.
Meredith| You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Andy| I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
Creed| Its pronounced Ker-nell. Its the highest rank in the military.
Andy| Its pronounced "Corn-ell!" Its the highest rank in the Ivy League!
Dwight|  Andy, lets just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
Andy| Fine.
Dwight| What do you say?
Andy|  Yeah, good. Can we---  Grr. Heh heh heh. Thats Big Red Bear! Thats a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
Holly| If you leave on Friday, by five, youll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
Michael| Yeah.
Holly| And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Michael| Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So were talking constantly all the way.
Holly| Oh.
Michael| Ill tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
Holly| Well-
Michael| Maybe Ill see an accident one weekend?
Holly| How long could we keep that up?
Michael| Years!
Holly| Years?
Michael| Yeah.
Holly| Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Michael| Heres my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
Holly|  Thank you.
Michael| My wish has come true, incidentally, because, youve met me, and you are happy.
Darryl| Clever, Mike.
Tom| So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?
Pete| Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
Jim| Thats not really true. Theres a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Tom| Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.
Jim| Wow, thats- thats a little rude. Whats your deal?
Pete| Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
Tom| Yeah. Right Pam?
Pam| Yup!
Michael| You know what? I think were a great couple. I think were a classic couple. I think were like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  Were like peanut butter and jelly, dont you think?
Holly| I do, I think so.
Michael| Then dont do it. Please dont do this. Please dont do this.
Darryl|  Hey whats up, I just thought Id try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
Michael| I dont know what Im gonna do!
Darryl| Please call me back.
Michael| Please?
Holly| Youll be okay
Michael| Im not gonna be okay.
Darryl| Please...
Holly| You will.
Michael| No I wont! Im not strong! And Ill go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
Andy|  You might be interested-
Stanley| What?
Andy| Dwight!
Dwight| Andy, Ive been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Gos?
Andy| Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, its irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
Dwight| Thats a conflict of interest.
Andy| Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I wont let you in?
Dwight|  Interview.
Andy|  Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Dwight| What?
Andy| The conference room!
Dwight| Okay.
Andy| Who are your role models?
Andy|  If I had to put Dwights chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
Andy| So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. Youre doing great.
Jim| Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. Shes a trumpeter. And, look at her.
Pam| Cute.
Jim| That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Tom| Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In."
Jim| Love that one.
Pete| Yeah but, she doesnt think shes gonna be like, career musician right?
Jim| Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Pete| Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Pam| Miles Davis.
Jim| One.
Pam| Chet ...something.
Jim| Half.
Pete| The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
Pam|  Dizzy Gillespie.
Jim| Also good.
Pete| And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you dont see me try to get on the Mets.
Tom| You dont!
Jim| Pete couldnt make the Mets. Shes at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Pete| Im just calling it like I see it.
Pam| I dont know if Im gonna make any money with art.
Jim| Pam, dont worry about it.
Pam| I mean its a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I dont try now, I never will. So...
Jim| Guys, what is going on?!
Tom| We pranked you!
Pete| It was Pams idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Pam| ... Got you.
Pete| That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Andy| Lets see how well you know your Big Red history.
Dwight| Bring it.
Andy| Who was Cornells eighth president?
Dwight| Dale Raymond Corson!
Andy| Mm, Im sorry thats incorrect. Cornells seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins.  Comprehension skills, sub-par.
Dwight| Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
Andy| What are you writing? Cant even give Cornell your full attention?
Dwight| On the contrary, Im helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Andy| Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
Dwight| Well, when they get my evaluation well see if theyre interested.
Andy| "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."
Dwight| "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
Andy| "Applicant is wasting everyones time with stupid and inane accusations."
Dwight| "Interviewer has suspect motives."
Andy| "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."
Dwight| "Interviewer has turned off applicants interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
Andy| I have everything I need-
Dwight| And you will be hearing from the -
Andy| And you will be hearing from -
Dwight| -Cornell Application Department,
Andy| which I will not be a part of-
Dwight| And you will not be pleased with the result.
Andy| And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
Dwight| And your affiliation with Cornell -
Andy| And your affiliation with Cornell -
Dwight| Will end completely!
Andy| Will end completely!
Dwight|  That is all sir, you may go.
Darryl|  Theres another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Pam| For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
Jim| Well, Ill be the judge of that. What do you got?
Pam| Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, its very subtle.
Jim| That is good.
Pam| Thank you.
Jim| Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family."
Pam| Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Darryl| This is the last of it.
Michael| Oh thats mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
Darryl| Youre not staying?
Michael| You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, Ill just ride back with you.
Darryl| But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Michael| Ill be down in just a second.  Holly?
Michael| So um... I think Im gonna go back with Darryl  Okay.  Goodbye.
Holly| Okay. Bye.
Darryl| I know its hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Michael| We didnt break up.
Darryl| Looked like it. Sometimes when Im down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
Michael| Okay.
Darryl|  Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
Michael| Thats a really pretty song.
Darryl| Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
Michael| Okay.
Darryl| Thats when you hit me with whats getting you down, okay?
Michael| Okay.
Darryl| Da  na na na na.
Michael| Da  na na na na.
Darryl| Da  na na na na.
Michael| Da  na na na na.
Darryl| No, wait. Youre, youre supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
Michael| Da  na na na na.
Darryl| Da  na na na na.
Michael| Da  na na na na.
Darryl| Da  na na na na!!
Michael| Da  na na na na!!
Darryl| Da  na na na na .
Michael|  Da  na na na na.
Darryl| Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
Michael|  Da  na na na na.
Darryl| YEAH! Da  na na na na.
Michael|  Da  na na na na...
Andy|   I thought Id come in casual today. Man, Im hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
Dwight| Where did you get those?
Andy| What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
Dwight| I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Andy| Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm.  Youre supposed to cook these, arent you?
Dwight|  Cornell.
