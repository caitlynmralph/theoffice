Michael| Its Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one.
Jim| LOVE the hair.
Pam| Morning Michael!
Michael| Hello! They took away my parking space but they cant take away my pride!
Michael| I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
Kelly| So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Jim| You realize youre not actually talking to me, right?
Kelly| And...
Charles| Hey Kelly?
Kelly| Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Charles| Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly.
Jim| The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. Its not the worse plan shes ever had.
Charles| Oh, and Kelly...
Kelly| Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Charles| Okay, Im gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Erin| If were changing names, can I be Erin? Its my middle name.
Charles| Erin. Okay, thats very pretty.
Kelly| Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Kevin| I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boys name?
Michael| We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam| What should we do now?
Michael| We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
Michael| I dont know I think weve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. Ive updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
Michael| I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
Pam| I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And its cold in there. Cause its technically a closet.
Andy| What do you think?
Dwight| Let me check.  Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Andy| Thank you!
Dwight| Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Ryan| You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, well hang out Scranton style.
Michael| Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan| Please dont listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, shes like um, shed probably be a Six in New York, but shes like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. Its a small space.
Charles| Hey Jim can I get a, um-
Jim| Hi!
Charles| Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Jim| Sure!
Charles| Yeah.
Jim| Okay.
Jim| What the hells a rundown?
Jim| When did you need that rundown by?
Charles| As soon as possible.
Jim| Okay.
Charles| Just get it right.
Jim| Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. Im gonna dive in. To the rundown. Ill be exhausted cause its like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Erin| Oh.
Dwight| You know theres a ghost in this office
Erin| Really?
Dwight| A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Erin| Why was she in this building?
Dwight|  Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Erin| Thats crazy.
Dwight| Yeah isnt it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Erin| Oh my god!
Dwight| It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Erin| Hmm.
Dwight| That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that youre next.
Erin| Oh!
Dwight| Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Erin| Yeah.
Dwight| Yeah?
Erin| Just got some ice.
Dwight| Erin  Erin...
Andy| Oh, this is awkward.
Erin| Oops!
Andy| Uh oh! Oh! Oh!
Erin| So Ill see you guys around!
Dwight| Hey buddy.
Michael| Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan| Pams better at that stuff
Pam| That is so insulting.
Ryan| How is it insulting to say that youre good at something?
Pam| Because the thing youre saying Im good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Ryan| Im not judging it, its like ... I could run GM but I couldnt fix a car. Its not  saying one is better than the other.
Pam| Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan| What the hell?
Michael| Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I dont make copies, Im the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Ryan| Yeah I make originals too.
Pam| Shut up!
Michael| Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam| Really!
Ryan| Yeah!
Toby| Not much? Whats up with you?  Nah its okay. Im in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? Its so good. No, you gotta tune in, its as good as anything on HBO.  Hey does blue go with tan?
Michael| Would someone just make the copy?
Toby| I have like, like a blue shirt? I dont wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Michael| Just make that copy okay?
Pam| Seriously? This is whats so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Ryan| Thats me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam| I dont want to look at your friend Jasmines boobs all day.
Ryan| You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam| Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan| This is from the sun.
Pam| Oh yeah I bet.
Michael| Theyre getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks hes too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
Pam| Michael, we can hear you.
Michael| Im on the phone, please. Mom, Im gonna have to call you back. Ps being a giant B.
Pam| Okay its my turn.
Ryan| No dont take that, give that back!
Pam| Give it back for what? Whatre you gonna do with it?
Ryan| Im gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam| Youre gonna make another "spreadsheet."
Ryan| Yeah!
Pam| Yeah exactly. Its my turn.
Ryan| Go make a copy, secretary.
Pam| Come on! Ryan!
Michael| They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Dwight| Hey buddy, what are you up to?
Andy| Um, nerthing?
Dwight| Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and Im assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Andy| Pffft.
Dwight| Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Andy| The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Dwight| And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Andy| No, thats ridiculous.
Dwight| No no no.
Andy| Look youve been here longer, and besides, Im a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Dwight| Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just,  Boom.
Michael| Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam| Definitely.
Michael| Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam| We could work from home.
Ryan| Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael| Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Pam|  .... Corner idea?
Michael| No, youre supposed to say, "Rock the house."
Ryan| Rock the house!
Pam| How would we know that?
Jim| Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
Oscar| Use it in a sentence.
Jim| "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
Oscar| Try another sentence.
Jim| "This rundown better be really good"?
Oscar| I dont know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Jim| Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Oscar| Why dont you just ask him--
Jim| No. I cant. It was like, hours ago.
Oscar| What have you been doing?
Kevin| Try it in another sentence.
Ryan| Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there.  I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one Im talking about its the one, the one with the awesome browser.  No, not that one.
Michael| Thats my corner.
Pam| I thought that was your corner.
Michael| No, this is where I work. I cant relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam| So my corners the one with the copier?
Michael| Pam, I dont make the rules.
Ryan| Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I dont want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Charles| You started on that rundown yet?
Jim| Oh, this is just something Im taking a break with.
Charles| Oh.
Jim| I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Charles| Okay, great.
Jim| Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown youre looking for ?
Charles| Just keep it simple.
Jim| Keeping it simple -thats what Im doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Charles| Youre working hard? On this?
Jim| No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Charles| Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Jim| No, I....
Erin| Can I help you?
Pam| No thanks.
Jim| Hey!
Pam| Hey Im here to see Charles.
Jim| Okay.
Pam| Hey Charles.
Charles| Hey Pam.
Pam| I know youre a very busy man so Ill cut right to the chase. Id like my old job back.
Charles| I dont know what to tell you. The jobs been taken.
Pam| Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Charles| Um.
Pam| Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Charles| Yeah I know.
Pam| Personal shopper?
Charles| No.
Pam| Well it was great catching up with you. And Ill see you around the building.
Charles| Okay.
Pam| Im just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if thats okay. The air smells so good. I dont remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Michael| Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Stanley| I get it.  You need to see more?
Phyllis| Its really cute.
Michael| Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley| Shes upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael| What for?
Stanley| I dont know.
Ryan| Are we staying til five?
Michael| Yes.
Michael| Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. Thatll show em.
Michael| Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan| Im texting. I dont want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael| Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, youre the face of this company.
Michael| Hey Pam.
Pam| Hey.
Michael| You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam| Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael| Yeah?
Pam| Thats as specific as Id like to be.
Michael| Well, at least youre still being honest with me.
Jim| Theres the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you werent prepared for.
Charles| Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Jim| Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Charles| Do I need to?
Jim| No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Charles| Whats that?
Jim| The one I have. Ill use the one I have.
Jim| Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Pam| Were small, but were eager to make a name for ourselves.
Man| Do you have a card?
Pam| Nope, I dont have a card, but Ill do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Creed| These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael| These are shaped like paper.
Creed| Well I dont even want these.
Meredith| Ill take them for my kid.
Erin| Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. Youre good!
Dwight| Youre good.
Erin| Thank you.
Andy| That was great, but its just sort of, its still a little choppy like. But dont worry, its hard, it took me a while too. Its like
Erin| Wow!
Andy| What? Oh my God you heard that Im so embarrassed. Im like so rusty.
Dwight| Oh its good, youre coming along. Its really technically proficient but really theres no heart or soul in it.
Andy| Really?
Dwight | Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Dwight and Erin | West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River
Dwight | In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Dwight and Andy | Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.
Dwight | Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Toby | You have to stop.
Michael| I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone.

Michael| Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we dont have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really whats important.
