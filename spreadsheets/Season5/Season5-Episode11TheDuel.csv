Pam|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Im sorry, hes not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
Michael|  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
Pam| Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. Its actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
Dwight|  Aah!
Phyllis| Wow, thirteen!
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| No. No, no. There was wind.
Dwight| I was just jogging.
Michael| Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
Jim| No, no, no, its not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
Michael| I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Stanley| There was a car.
Michael| I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Oscar| Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
Michael| Go, Oscar. Thirty-ones my number.
Oscar| Thats impossible.
Michael| Beat it!
Michael| Todays a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, Ill be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
Pam| Quick announcement new year, new candy.
Kevin| Whoo-hoo!
Pam| Okay, be careful, Kevin. Theyre kind of spicy.
Kevin| Hot tamales.
Pam| Yeah.
Kevin| Uh oh.
Pam| So, maybe just try one at first, and then if its okay, have a couple more...
Andy|  Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. Its kind of the elephant in the room, so Ill just...  No one has RSVPed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
Michael| Wait, you still dont know...
Jim|  No, no. Nope.
Andy| Hmm?
Jim| Nothing.
Michael| You still dont know.
Jim| Why dont... Lets...
Michael|  What are you doing?
Jim| How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Michael| Andy.
Jim| Ahh! 
Andy| No, no one has RSVPed, and I dont understand it, and now, youre shutting me out. Youre not even listening. Thats really considerate. Thank you.
Michael|  No, what Im saying is...
Jim| No, no.
Michael| No, thats not it.
Jim| I know.
Jim| Andy still doesnt know that Angelas having an affair with Dwight. And its been seventeen days. I mean, eventually hell figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now its just... awkward.
Michael|  How can he still not know?
Jim| We cant figure that out.
Michael| I cant take it anymore.
Dwight| Wait, what?  You cant take what?
Michael| I am telling Andy.
Dwight| No. You cant do that. It shouldnt come from you.
Michael| Who should it come from, then?
Everyone|  Angela.
Michael|  Are you still having intercourse with her? 
Oscar| What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Michael| Did you ever have intercourse in this office? 
Oscar| Are you serious? Ugh. Where?  Where?  Where, Dwight?
Dwight|  Seems like you already know where.
Angela| Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Kevin| Oh, Im sorry. I didnt realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I wouldve admitted it, and stopped right away.
Angela| Thats enough.
Kevin| Because I wouldnt want an innocent person, who doesnt know anything about the form...  What?
Oscar| That was good... Its just, at the end you werent saying something that could also apply to the form.
Kevin| How about, "Im sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"
Oscar| There you go.
Andy|  That cannot be true!  Youre going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What Im saying is, I want to cut it myself...
Dwight|  Trade seats with me.
Jim| No.
Dwight| Ive got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
Jim| Please stop.
Dwight|  I need a soup spoon.
Dwight| Rule 17 dont turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five.  Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you dont, youll be eaten in your sleep. 
Dwight| 
Angela| What is it?
Dwight| Youve got to tell Andy about us.
Angela| That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Dwight| Get it over with. Then we dont have to hide anymore.
Angela| Youre expanding on your worst idea.
Dwight| Do you love me or not?
Angela| Ive already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Dwight| Because youre engaged to Andy.
Angela| 
Michael| Well?
Dwight| Not yet.
Jim| When?
Andy| When what?  When what?
Michael| You know this cant go on.
Andy| What cant go on?
Michael| We have to put an end to this.
Andy| Seems like...
Michael| Come on. 
Andy| You guys should... be hearing what Im saying.
Jim| This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Dwight| Angela said she was going to tell him. Shes just not ready.
Michael| When will she be ready?
Dwight| I dont know.
Michael| Is she crazy in bed?
Dwight|  Yes.
Jim| Stop. What?
Michael| How so, specifically?
Jim| Okay, listen.
Dwight| Eager.
Jim| This shouldnt happen at work.
Dwight| And flexible.
Jim| And!
Michael| Really?
Jim| This shouldnt be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Michael| Its too late.
Jim| Well its not too late, because you havent done anything.
Michael| I am already walking.
Dwight| Michael, once this gets out... I dont know how its going to go down.
Michael| Okay, what does that mean?
Dwight| Might get ugly.
Michael|  Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
Jim| But youre leaving...
Dwight|  Have a good trip.
Michael| Thanks.  Andy?
Andy| Yeah.
Michael| Walk with me.
Andy| Will do, boss-man.
Michael| Ohh, I do not have much time... cars all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldnt want to hear...
Andy| Youre not making any sense.
Michael| Well... no, Im not. So I... Im not very articulate today, so Ill just leave it for another time. Another day.
Andy| All righty.
Michael| Which will be fine. I am off!
Andy| Have a good meeting!
Michael| Thank you! 
Andy|  Kick Wallaces ass!
Michael|  Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Andy| I cant hear you through the glass
Michael|  Dwight and Angela are having an affair. Theyve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Andy| What?
Michael| All right. See you later.  Ahh.
Andy| Are you serious?
Michael| Yep. 
Meredith| I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Oscar| You said that yesterday.
Meredith| Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
Jim|  What are you standing for?
Dwight| If Im sitting, I cant disable his neck or his groin.
Jim| Youre not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Dwight| If Im sitting, I dont have the option to.
Jim| Dwight, Im in charge when Michaels gone, and I need you to sit...
Andy|  I need to talk to you.
Angela| We can talk right here.
Andy| I need to talk to you in private.
Kevin| Were not listening.
Andy| Lets go to the conference room.
Andy| Is it true?
Angela| What have you heard?
Andy| That youre sleeping with Dwight.
Angela| That doesnt sound like me.
Andy| Is it true?
Angela| Andy, Im engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didnt want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Andy| Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Angela| A little bit.
Andy| How long has it been going on?
Angela| I dont know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I dont know exactly when we started up again.
Andy| Who else knows about it?
Angela| Michael.
Andy| Who else?
Angela|  Let me think about it... I, um... there... 
Andy| Oh God. Come on!
David| So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I dont know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Michael| Right what?
David| Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers.  Look, youre not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Michael| David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Dont ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where youve been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
Michael| Sometimes Ill start a sentence, and I dont even know where its going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
Michael| This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when its cooler.
David| Heres the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. Its not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. Its Hail Mary time.
Michael|  Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
David| What say we do.
Angela| Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
Andy| So like, missionary...
Angela| I said nothing fancy.
Andy| Do you love him?
Angela| I love you.
Andy| Why should I believe that?
Angela| Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that were not good together.
Andy| Who says that?
Angela| Or, we can prove them wrong. Lets prove them wrong.
Andy| Wheres Dwight?
Jim| You okay, man?
Andy| No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? Id also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me whats been going on this entire time.
Creed| You are welcome.
Andy|  Dwight.
Dwight| Andy.
Andy| Its over.
Dwight| Oh good. She broke up with you.
Andy| No. Its over between you two.
Dwight| Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
Andy| You have to.
Dwight| No I dont.
Andy|  She doesnt love you. Shes marrying me.
Dwight|  Well I dont know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
Andy| Angela Bernard.
Dwight| Will never be her name.
Andy| It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Dwight| I dont think so.
Jim| Hey guys, why dont we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Andy| Im telling you to back down.
Dwight| And Im telling you that I will never back down.
Andy| Then Ill make you.
Dwight| Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Andy| Through the use of force.
Dwight| That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Andy| I will fight you.
Jim| Nope.
Dwight| Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
Andy| Fine!
Dwight| Fine!
Oscar| This is nuts.
Dwight| What is your weapon?
Jim| Okay, you know what? Thats enough. Because...
Dwight| Hey, this is none of your business.
Jim| Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Andy| Guess what? Not happening at work.
Dwight| Yes!
Andy| Were gonna do it outside.
Dwight| Outside of work.
Andy| None of your business.
Dwight| None of your business then.  Good. So what weapon?
Andy| My bare hands.
Dwight| That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Andy| Then Ill get something too.
Meredith| Ive had two men fight over me before. Usually its over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Pam| Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
Angela|  I will respect the results of the duel.
Pam| Of course you will.
Meredith| I call loser!
Andy| I will be taking my break at 400 in the parking lot.
Dwight| I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Andy|  What a coincidence.
Dwight| Mm.
Jim| So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
Jim| 
Dwight|  Howd that get there?
Meredith| Theres a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
Jim| Thanks Meredith.
Michael| So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that Ive never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed."
David| Its hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying.  And thanks for coming in.
Michael|  Oh, thank you.
David| Yes.
Michael| I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
David| Yeah.
Michael| Okay. 
David|  Yeah, finish up.
Dwight|  Come on! Where are you? Lets do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Angela|  I cant believe theyre gonna fight over me.
Kelly| I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
Dwight| Come on!
Meredith| Hey, has anything happened yet?
Dwight| Where are you?
Oscar| Mm-mm. Its 410, I dont think hes gonna show.
Kevin| Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
Dwight| Come on, coward! Where are you? Where...  "From the desk of Andrew Bernard."  A note. Pathetic. "Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested." True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..." 
Kelly| Theres Andy, hes in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Phyllis| Why isnt Dwight turning around?
Oscar| The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Creed| Yeah.
Dwight|  Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
Pam| Oh my God!
Stanley| Whats happening?
Phyllis| Andys running over Dwight with his car.
Dwight| Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Andy| Yeah.
Everyone watching| Oh!
Dwight| Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
Andy| You give up?
Dwight| Never!  Get out and face me like a man!
Andy| I am a man! Im a bigger man than youll ever be! I would never sleep with another mans fiance!
Dwight| Youre not a man! You dont know how to take care of her!  All you do is dress fancy and sing.  "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You cant even protect her!
Andy| Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? Whens the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
Dwight| Last year, idiot! 
Jim| Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Dwight| No. My right ones falling asleep a little bit.
Jim| Andy, are you all right?
Andy| Go away, Tuna! Im winning this!
Dwight| Yeah, back off. This isnt your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost?  Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! 
Andy| What did you say? Im sorry, I couldnt hear you.
Dwight| I sa- 
Andy| What? You stupid idiot!  Youre like, youre like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
Dwight| Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Andy| I dont get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
Dwight| What?
Andy| What!
Dwight| Shes sleeping with you?
Andy| Im her fiance.
Dwight| She said she was only sleeping with me.
Andy|  Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, thats the one.
Dwight| 
Andy| Thank you. 
Michael| Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Heres an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!
Dwight|
