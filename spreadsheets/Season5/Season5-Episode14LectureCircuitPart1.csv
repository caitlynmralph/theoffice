Michael| 
Jim| This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Michael|  This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
Jim| 
Michael| Could I stick it with a pin?
Pam| Ugh.
Michael|  Toby Flenderson to the principals office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and theyre wet with your urine.
Jim| 
Michael| You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
Jim| Thats pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Michael| What?
Jim| What the heck? Is that, uh... 
Michael| You find it?
Jim| I didnt, Ill look somewhere else.
Michael| All right.
Jim| All right.
Michael| Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
Michael|  Hello, good morning.
Pam| Good morning.
Michael| You ready? And were off, like a herd of turtles.
Michael| Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
Pam| He brought a sled.
Michael| No! That is a toboggan, you never know when youre gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
Pam| Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Michael| Yeah, oh dont say bucks, its not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Pam| Separate rooms.
Michael| Well that goes without saying.
Pam| Im going to say it anyway.
Michael| Hey! Look at what youre wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magicians assistant?  Thats...
Pam| This is a new cardigan.
Michael|  ...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Pam| No.
Michael| No. Oh, all right.
Jim|  Hey, Kelly.
Kelly| Screw you.
Dwight| Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Kelly| Oh yeah? Screw you too.
Jim| Whoa! What was that all about.
Phyllis| You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
Jim|  Go ahead.
Dwight| Go ahead, you do it.
Jim| Okay.
Dwight| I insist.
Jim| Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Dwight| What he said was... 
Jim|  Just, easy.
Dwight| ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Jim| Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Dwight|  I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating.  Thats on my side.
Jim| So this is fun.
Kelly| My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasnt even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Pam| Can I turn on the radio?
Michael| No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Pam| But then you fall asleep and theres nothing for me to do.
Michael| Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
Pam| Thats dangerous.
Michael| Well then... hey you know what then lets just talk.
Pam| Thats okay I can... Im fine. Ill just play a song in my head.
Michael| You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
Pam| No, that was a long time ago.
Michael| Is that why your wearing makeup today?
Pam| No, Im not even wearing that much.
Pam| I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldnt hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
Julia| Oh, this is a nice office.
Stanley|  You dont have to lie. Through here.
Andy| Um Phyllis, whos that?
Phyllis| Shes out of your league Andy.
Andy| For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
Phyllis| Sexually?
Andy| This conversation is over.
Andy| I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
Jim| We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Kelly| Screw you guys. Youre dead to me.
Dwight| If you say screw you one more time...
Kelly| Yeah, screw you, beefer, I dont forget your birthday, I would never do that.
Dwight| Hey, HEY.
Jim|  Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Kelly| I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
Dwight| Oh God.
Jim| Okay.
Kelly| In a way, its good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Dwight| What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Kelly| Ice Cream.
Pam|  Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Michael| Hello, Rolando, how are you?
Rolando| Hi.
Michael| Rolando,  Id like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
Rolando|  Uh, your late, everyones already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over.
Michael| Okay, dont be nervous, just picture her naked.
Pam| Stop it, please.
Michael| Thats what I do, steal my trick.
Pam| Please cut it out.
Karen| Hey. Hi, guys. 
Michael|  Oh my God. Is that Jims?
Karen| What!
Pam| Michael!
Karen| Of course not!
Michael| Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, youre huge! Thats incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... Im just, Im trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
Karen| Lets just get this over with, shall we?
Michael| Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
Jim|  Are you kidding?
Dwight| Well, Im not done yet.
Jim| Dwight. This,  fits in the palm of my hand. You havent blown em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Dwight| They match the carpet
Jim| What is that?  It is your birthday period.
Dwight| Its a statement of fact.
Jim| Not even an exclamation point?
Dwight| This is more professional. Its not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Jim| I cant believe how bad this looks.
Dwight| Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal mans.
Jim| Okay, good then.
Dwight| Have you collected the money from everyone?
Jim| I am working on it.
Dwight| How much do you have?
Jim| Six dollars.
Dwight|  Thats how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
Jim| I said I was working on it.
Dwight| 
Andy|  Trying to see what CDs she got. Its good to know the deets about the girl youre wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes!  Whoa! Aah, Aah! 
Michael|  NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. Ill talk to you...  This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didnt! He is alive. And this isnt even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you cant return it. Or can you? No you cant.  Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
Karen| Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Michael| I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Karen| But now we think youre a liar.
Michael| Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? 
Michael| I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
Michael| I dont know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
Mark| Yes.
Michael| Got it. It works.
Karen| Uh, its very insulting.
Michael| But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
Mark| But we already know each others names.
Michael| Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think its worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Karen| Okay. All right everyone, meetings over.
Michael| Oh, I still have more.
Karen| Can I please see you in my office, please?
Michael| She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, lets go.
Julia| I cant accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget.
Andy| Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Lets see. How many did I put in there?  One, Two, Three, Four Splendas in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I dont know how you take it. But if youd rather...
Stanley| Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
Andy| Well, No, I actually only put in two. But thats not how the songs goes.
Stanley| Are you out of your damn mind?
Andy| Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you dont even set me up with her.
Stanley| Were not friends. I didnt think about it.
Andy| We are friends. Stanley, were friends. And you let me down.
Stanley| You really like her, huh?
Andy| Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Stanley|  Give me two clients for her.
Michael| I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."
Karen| No thats, that is incredibly dangerous.
Michael| No, dont worry, the chain is off.
Pam| No its not.
Karen| You know, I think Im just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Michael| Emails not scary. This is an opportunity. Dont, dont blow it.
Pam| So when are you due?
Karen| Uh, in about a month.
Pam| Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
Karen| Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Michael| Its really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
Karen| Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
Michael| Oh, great.
Karen| His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Pam| Oh, hes cute.
Karen| Yeah, hes so cute. Hes a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Pam| What is happening there? 
Karen| Oh, yeah. Dont even. Thats really dorky.
Pam| Its really sweet.
Michael| No, its really dorky. You were right the first time.
Karen| So, how are things in Scranton? Hows Jim?
Pam| Uh, theyre good. Uh, Jims good. Were engaged.
Karen| Thats so great. Thats great.
Pam| Thank you.
Karen| Oh, my God. Im so happy for you. 
Michael| Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. Its a really wonderful moment.
Stanley| I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. Youre in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
Andy| So Julia, um, lets see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriends house or?
Julia| No, it could go straight to our business address.
Andy| Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
Julia| Actually, I, I dont have a boyfriend.
Andy|  Really? Is that... wow, thats so weird.
Andy| Guys, stop everything. Im about to ask out this girl, and Im completely panicking.
Oscar|  Oh, my desk is over... 
Creed| This gal, shes really into you?
Andy| Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Ive seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
Creed| All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her whos the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
Andy| Okay, it sounds risky.
Creed| Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
Andy| Wait, what?
Michael| I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
Pam| I like her.
Michael| Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Pam| Im serious. Um, Im really glad I came.
Michael| Why?
Pam| Because, um, cause Ill never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. Shes happy and, I dont know, it feels good.
Julia| Thanks for walking me out.
Andy| Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, theres all kinds of weirdos out here, so...
Julia| You must be freezing.
Andy| I am about to die.  Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Julia| Oh, no, its okay. This is my car.
Andy| Okay, Okay. Well listen, youre a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
Julia| Whats a "Nard-Dog"?  
Andy|  This is the Nard-Dog.
Julia|  Whoa. What the hell?
Andy| Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And Im a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. Youre, like, incredibly pretty.
Julia| I just got out of a relationship too. Its really hard.
Andy| Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
Julia| No, I, I dont think so.
Andy| Sure, yeah thats... your right. Its too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So Im glad we go that out of the way. Im gonna be in touch with you. In three months. Im gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
Julia|  Okay.
Andy| Take care Julia.
Julia| Thank you.
Andy|  Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Andy| We lost the account.
Dwight|  Damn it!  Dwight Schrute.
Jim|  How olds Kelly?
Dwight| Who is this?
Jim| Its Mose. Who do you think it is?
Dwight| Mose doesnt know how to use a phone. So jokes on you.
Jim| Look, Im at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Dwight| Uh, 24. 37.
Jim| Do you think Im calling you for your best approximation?
Dwight|  Ill call you back. 
Dwight| I have here Kelly Kapoors personal and confidental file. Allow me to share.   "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."  Blah, Blah, Blah. 
Pam| Are you asleep?
Michael| No.  Im just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Pam| No, remind me.
Michael| Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
Pam| Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly.
Michael| She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didnt... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I havent talked to her since. I havent seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
Pam| Okay, lets go.
Michael|  Ill just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
Pam| Yeah, screw em. Lets do this.
Michael|  Okay.
Jim|  So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kellys party.
Creed| Id like to contribute.
Jim| Oh, great.
Creed|  There you go.
Jim|
