Phone Salesman| Hi.
Pam| Good morning, can I help you?
Phone Salesman| Yes, Im from Techstar about a new phone system for you.   I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott.
Pam| Im sorry, hes not in right now.
Phone Salesman| Really? Hes never around when I come by.
Pam| Shoot.
Pam| They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But Id like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.  Vending machine.
Phone Salesman| How about I make an appointment to come back?  That way, I know hell be here.
Pam| That is a great idea.
Phone Salesman| Great.
Pam|  Um, oh boy, lets see, hes really...
Jim|  Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Pam| There he is!
Phone Salesman| Oh, hi! Great.
Jim| Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we dont need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Michael|  Hello, may I help you?
Jim| Jimbo!
Michael| ...Jim.
Jim|   Ayyyy!
Michael| Ayyyy!
Pam| Ayyyy!
Michael| Ayyyy!
Jim| Ayyyy!
Dwight|  Ayyyy!
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight| Ayyyy!
Phone Salesman| Ok.  Im, uh, Ill be going.
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight| Ayyyy!
Michael|  What was that?
Pam| That was funny.
Michael| That was funny.  Lets go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
Michael| Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Kevin| I miss Stacy.
Michael| Yeah, I hear ya.   Its been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think youre hurting...
Kevin| I cant even imagine.
Pam| This is our first and only Valentines Day as fiances. 
Jim| Youre only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Pam| Really, Jim?  On Cupids birthday?
Jim| Yeah.    Shes fine.
Kelly| So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.   Roses are red, violets are blue, its time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Michael| Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.    Theyre very pretty and I wouldnt want them to fall.  
Michael| Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentines Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
Michael| Pam, really, theyre back?
Pam| I cant see them when theyre on the floor
Jim| Theyre for her to look at, Michael.
Michael| Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Jim| Yes, lets have a word.
Michael| Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Jim| Oh, Im sorry.
Michael| Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, its creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Jim| I understand that. 
Dwight| So sexy it becomes hostile.
Michael| Mm-hmm.
Jim| Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Michael| Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Jim| We do.
Michael| --that none of us can be a part of--
Pam| You cant be a part of our relationship, Michael.
Michael|  --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentines Day party.
Jim| That sounds fun.
Michael| So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely hearts convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
Dwight| Yeah, deal with it Pam!
Michael| So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
Dwight| Having trouble finding a vein?
Blood Drive Worker| Yup, a little.
Dwight| How about now? 
Dwight| I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself.  
Michael| I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, thats a big needle, that --
Blood Drive Worker| Youre gonna need to lie down right over here.
Michael| Okay.  Hello.
Blood Girl| Hi, I cant talk right now.  Im sorry.
Michael| Oh, OK.
Blood Girl| Whew, Im really nervous.
Michael| Yeah, me too.
Blood Girl| Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
Michael| Oh, well, thats fine.
Blood Girl| Whew, its better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
Michael| Yeah, can I point something out to you?  
Blood Girl| Sure.
Michael| Youre actually talking a lot.
Blood Girl| Sorry, its the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
Michael| Okay, here we go.
Blood Drive Worker| Alright, here we go.
Michael| Oh, God. 
Blood Drive Worker| Just relax.
Michael| Yup, Im good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.
Blood Girl| Oh, thats gross.
Michael| Type O-Ocean Spray.
Blood Girl| God, stop.  Stop it.
Phyllis| Hey, why dont you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  Well take all afternoon.  Michael is terrified of bob.
Pam| What do you think?
Jim| I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines arent gonna sweep themselves.
Pam| Were in.
Michael| Yick.
Blood Girl| What?
Michael| I looked at the bag.
Blood Girl| Ew.
Michael| I looked straight at the bag.
Blood Girl| Thats not good.
Michael| Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that dont have blood in them?
Blood Girl| Well, ok... bags!  Alright, that was bad.
Michael| That was mean.
Blood Girl| Um, a hat.
Michael| A hat.
Blood Girl| A hat with no blood in it?
Michael| That is full of soup.
Blood Girl| Youre cute.
Michael| What?
Blood Drive Worker| Youre done. 
Michael| Oh, already.
Blood Girl| Ah, we did it!
Michael| Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I dont think I ate for three days. 
Blood Girl| Is he OK?
Michael|  Oh my God, how long was I out?  
Hank| What?
Michael| Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
Blood Drive Worker| Oh.  She left.
Michael| OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, thats hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if Im gonna return her glove.
Blood Drive Worker| Im sorry sir we cant give out that information. 
Meredith|  What are you doing?
Kelly| Decorating.
Meredith| Ill help.   Now its just a stupid baby.
Kelly| Yeah, thanks.
Phyllis| It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Pam| Anything to get out of that office.	
Phyllis| I know
Bob| I honestly dont know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass.
Phyllis| Hes talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. 
Jim| Oh yeah, I understood. 
Michael| Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us.  Relationships, we dont need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
Kelly| Well, his heart was in the right place.
Michael| Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, lets, who else?  Oscar.
Oscar| I dont think so.
Michael| Come on, Im sure theres something you need to get off your chest.
Oscar| I cant.
Michael| If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  Im sure whatever you did it wasnt your fault.  OK well, who else?
Bob| Everyone here whos bowled a 280 please raise your hand. 
Jim| No way, a 280?
Pam| Wow,  thats impressive.
Phyllis| Okay. Now everyone here whos bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Jim| Yikes.
Phyllis| Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. 
Jim| No.  Bob, no. No!
Pam| What?
Bob| One time. You love bringing up that one time, dont you?
Phyllis| Yes I do.
Pam| Jim uses a 6 pound ball. 
Jim| That is a lie, that is a lie. 
Pam| Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
Jim| But! That girl mustve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Pam| No, you just have little dainty fingers.
Bob| Oh yeah.  You can always model ladies jewelry.
Jim| Nobody asked, Bob!
Oscar| Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Angela| Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Oscar| I was stupid, I told him.
Kevin| Was he in to you in like a gay way?
Michael| Moron, if he was there wouldnt be a story.
Oscar| He told me he wasnt gay. 
Michael| Really sad.
Oscar| Im not done yet.
Michael| Oh my God.
Kevin| A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says "I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City." 
Michael| Well then its a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Angela| My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Oscar| Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Angela| No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Oscar| Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Angela| I guess I have.  Huh.
Michael| Alright whos next?  Wheres Andy?
Oscar| Hes on one of his honeymoons.
Michael| What?
Oscar| He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so hes just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today hes hot air ballooning and later hes got a couples massage.
Kevin| My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said "Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!" and she said that were done.
Michael| You know what guys? I dont think we need to do this.
Dwight| Youre right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Michael| No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentines, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  Theres a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
Dwight| A net? a giant net?
Michael| No.  Not a giant net.
Dwight| What do you have in mind?
Michael| I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Dwight| Oh God, thats a terrible idea.
Michael| Old fashioned meet market --
Dwight| No.
Michael| -- I dont think it is.
Dwight| Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, youre not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  Youre like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Michael| These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "Im in love I was hit by cupids sparrow."  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.  
Michael| Hey.
Dwight| Hey.  No movement.
Michael| Ah, still early. 
Dwight| Eh, its not that early.
Michael|  So how you holding up? 
Dwight| Im ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Michael| No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Dwight| Oh.  Meh.
Michael| Meh, exactly.  Eh.
Dwight| Eh.
Michael| Oh, here we go.
Dwight| Hello.
Michael| Hello.  
Dwight| Dwight K. Schrute. Why dont you introduce me to your little friend?   Hi, Dwight.
Michael| Babe alert!   Hello, Im Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Lynn| Oh, hi! Im Lynn.
Michael| Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Kevin| Hello.
Lynn| Hi.
Michael|  So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.   Where you from?
Kevin| Im from here!
Michael| Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Kevin| Thank you, Michael.
Dwight| I can untie any knot.  Im serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
Blonde| I- I- believe you.
Dwight| You shouldnt believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Blonde| Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.
Dwight| You must use a lot of paper.
Blonde| Oh God tons of it .  
Pam| Whats the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
Jim| I think if you ordered hot food youre allowed to eat.
Pam| Oh, damn.  Theyve been in there for like ten minutes.
Jim| Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food. 
Pam| Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries. 
Jim| We should help him out. 
Kevin| At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  Its really cool.
Lynn| That does sound cool.
Kevin| I used to go there with my fiance . Before she left me .   No, I mean, before I left her .  She left me.    
Kevin| I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Michael| So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Eric| I am.
Michael| Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so thats sort of a repair.  Alright, Ill let you guys talk.
Michael| Its going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause thats what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.  Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so  its not too late.
Dwight| ...and the kind of discounts were talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Michael| No reason.
Dwight| Is somebody after you?
Oscar| Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Dwight| Hey, it just takes one!
Michael| Nobodys after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
Kelly| You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Michael| Its not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Kelly| Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, its like a fairy tale.
Meredith| She could be your soul mate.
Dwight| Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just dont add up.
Oscar| Its possible.
Kelly| She could be.
Michael| Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Kelly| Aww. 
Jim| Here they come. 
Pam|  What?
Jim| No, just kidding.  Seriously though, thats enough.
Pam| Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Jim| Oh great, I have to cover?
Pam| Do you think they dined and dashed?
Jim| Well they didnt dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Pam| I thought we were having a nice time.
Jim| We were.
Pam| Yeah.
Jim|  Empty.
Pam|  Mine too. 
Jim| Oh boy.
Pam| My God. 
Jim| OK.
Girl| Is this the party? 
Michael| Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Bob| OK then.
Jim| So...
Bob| Where were we?
Phyllis|  Bowling.
Pam| Yep, that, yeah.
Bob| You didnt eat much there Jimbo.
Jim| Oh initially I did.
Bob| Want some meat?
Phyllis| Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Bob| Forgot.
Phyllis| Yeah, thank you. 
Kevin| Hey, Im sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. 
Lynn| Thats really sweaty.
Kevin| Are you on email?
Lynn| Oh, yeah. 
Kevin| Cool. Bye.
Lynn| Bye, Kevin.
Kevin| Good Valentines.
Dwight| So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Blonde| OK. 
Dwight| OK, whats up?
Blonde| Look, Im gonna go...
Dwight| Oh-oh-oh before you go, Id just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Blonde| Look, we already have a paper supplier.
Dwight| OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Michael| Hey, you dont deserve her.
Dwight| Thanks, Michael.
Michael| Hey, if anybody wants to go...
Oscar| We can stay a little longer.
Michael| Really?   Oh, thanks.
Kelly| Michael, its time.
Michael| You know what, you guys, you guys can get out Im gonna soldier on a little bit.
Oscar| Come on, well all go.
Michael|  OK.
Michael| Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that Ive even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes its not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but its about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   Theres a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
Stanley| Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and Im still feeling woozy.
Blood Drive Worker| Of course.  Thats weird.  You got a cotton ball and tape and weve been using Band-Aids.
Stanley|  I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just  Band-Aids.
Phyllis| Damn.
