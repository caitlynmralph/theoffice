Erin|   Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... Hes not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, Ill give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Jim| Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so were all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 500 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
Jim|  Okay, Im gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Pam|  I can do it.
Dwight|  What do you need from me?
Dwight| Normally I dont condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I dont know.  No, Im kidding. Hes just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Michael| 
Dwight|  Like clockwork.
Jim|  Three, two, one... 
Michael|  Uh oh. Whats so funny?
Pam| You had to be there.
Michael| Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, lets all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Michael| See you later!
Dwight| Bye Michael!  Yeah!
Jim|  All right, you ready for this?
Pam| Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| Okay.
Jim| Wait, should I have left the car running? 
Pam| Oh, dont get us wrong, we like picnics.
Jim| Come on, who doesnt like a picnic?
Pam| Tell them what happened last year.
Jim| I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Pam| No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Jim| Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Pam| Yeah, you dont grab these  for balance.
Jim| Well...
Dwight| Im gonna say 30.
Rolph| Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
Dwight| Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Rolph| Woah. Homemade?
Dwight| Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? 
Dwight| Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Kevin| Michael, isnt that Holly?
Michael| Were just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Holly| Oh no, I see theyre letting just anybody in here.
Michael| Mmhmm. Yeah, thats right.
Holly| All right.
Michael| All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
Holly| Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Michael| A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
AJ| Hey Michael.
Michael| Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Holly| Lemonade sounds great.
Michael| Okay.
AJ| Id love an iced tea, actually.
Michael| You can go to hell.  Im kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Michael| I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and Im going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesnt make any sense. Were soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
Charles| Jim. Pam.
Jim| Hey, how are you?
Pam| Hey Charles.
Charles| Nice day, huh?
Jim| Yeah.
Charles| Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. 
Jim| I dont get it. Hes not even my boss anymore.
Pam| Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Jim| No, I shouldnt have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Dwight| Listen up everyone! Ive gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jims whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Jim| Well, I couldve died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Dwight| Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Andy| Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
Dwight| Why? I dont understand.
Andy| If-
Dwight| Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Andy| Uh... 
Dwight| Ill tell you what, Im gonna do you one better. Im gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Andy| Thats...
Dwight| Sly dog.
Andy| ... not what I meant.
Dwight| Come on, folks!
Michael| What is up with you two, Holly?
Holly| Um, not much.
AJ| Were designing a house.
Michael| Cool. For who?
AJ| For us.
Michael| Wow... Im designing a chair. Its part of your pants. You sit down, youre supported.
Holly| I remember your chair pants idea. 
AJ| I like that. Put me down for a pair. Im a size 34 waist.
Michael| All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Holly| Okay, yeah.
AJ| You guys are really gonna do this?
Michael| You bet your fat ass we are.
Michael| Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Holly| Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Michael| Thats right.
Holly|  Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Michael| Newspapers for sale!
Andy|  Are you blind?! Are you blind?!  Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? Im concerned you might be in danger.
Man| These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
Andy| Okay, I was just looking out for you.  Youre doing great, by the way.
Erin| Thanks.
Kevin|  I got it. 
Dwight| Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Andy| Are you blind?!
Dwight| I couldve gotten that, idiot!
Andy| Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Dwight| Its not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Lets focus! Come on, youre better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Phyllis| Weve been out here for a while. I dont need this.
Dwight| 
Dwight|  Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hands on the net.
Woman| So what?
Dwight| Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if youre right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Pam| Back off, Dwight.  Hyuh!  What?
Pam| Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Pam|  Hyuh!  Well, look at that, we win!
Jim| Nice job, Beesly.
Dwight| Yes! We advance to the next round!
Phyllis| Oh, Lord in heaven.
Stanley|  Had to be part of the group. 
Michael| I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Holly| Ooh, yes please.  Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Michael|  What?
Holly| Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Michael| Um, no, I just thought wed wing it. That cool?
Holly| Crystal cool.
Dwight|  Hit it Andy!
Andy| Bump! I bumped it!
Kevin| Set!
Dwight| Dont set it to yourself!
Kevin|  Yeah!
Phyllis| Ow, my ankle!
Dwight| What happened?
Phyllis| I... twisted it.
Dwight| You werent even moving.  Okay, sub!
Angela| I can play.
Rolph| Is there a... Meredith here?
Meredith| Yeah! Man in!
Angela| Rolph, did you not hear me?
Rolph| I dont hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friends heart. Lets go!
Michael| We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Holly|  We could do Back to the Future.
Michael| Oh!
Holly| We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. 
Michael| Could we get a Delorean?
Holly| Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Michael| Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
Holly| Dun-der. Dun-der...
Michael| Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! 
Holly| Oh... We havent found our great idea yet.
Michael| No. No.
Holly| Oh.
Michael| Were circling it.
Holly| Hmm...
David|  Nicely done. Were still going to crush you though!
Charles| Yes we are!
Rolph| You suckers are goin down! Theyre gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
Dwight| Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- 
Rolph| Its true!
Toby| Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Kendall| Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.
Toby| Really, really funny.
Kendall| Really funny.
Dwight| Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. 
Oscar| Settle down gentlemen.
Pam| Good game!
David| Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Michael|  Uh, its a sketch now.
David| Okay, introducing Scrantons Michael Scott performing with Nashuas Holly Flax! I have not seen this. 
Michael| And now, presenting...
Both| SlumDunder Mifflinaire! 
Michael| 
Holly| Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Michael| Yes, I am.
Holly| For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Michael| Ohh, Im thinking... Im going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
Holly| That is correct!  How did you know that?! 
Michael|  Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Holly|  Nice campus. Think youll get in?
Michael| Yeah, Im definitely getting in. Im a shoo-in.
Holly| Im Robert Dunder.
Michael| Im Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay. 
Holly| Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Michael| Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than Ive ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Holly| That is correct!
Michael| Yes!
Stanley| I usually dont enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Holly| The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Michael| I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
Holly| That is correct!
Man from Buffalo|  What is he talking about?
Holly|  How did you know that?!
Michael| David Wallace told me!!
Woman from Buffalo| David, is this true?
David| Uh, okay everyone, were at a picnic today...
Man from Buffalo| Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
Holly| They didnt know?
Michael|  I guess not.
David| Im sorry, this certainly wasnt the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Woman from Buffalo| And?
David| Were- were closing the Buffalo branch.
Man from Buffalo|  Youve got to be kidding me! Youve got to be kidding me! Were the best branch in the company! I cant believe it. 
David| How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Michael| Well... I didnt know they didnt know.
David| What about the fact that theyre here today? What about that? That didnt throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, "oh, this would be really funny."
Michael| Thank you.
David| Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, "is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?"
Michael| Well, hes just thinking about his own gifts.
Meredith| Maybe we shouldnt play due to the circumstances.
Dwight| Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Pam| How do you figure?
Dwight| Because if we dont play, then the other team wins.
Oscar| Dwights right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Pam| Lets do this.
Andy|  Jim, come on! 
Charles| Look who just woke up!  Ive been up for a while.
Kevin| Its six to six. Its a nail-biter. 
Angela| Kevin! Now its seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Rolph| Heres an accounting question for you what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer one whore.
Dwight| Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Rolph| What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
Dwight| Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Rolph| No way! You dont mean that!
Dwight| Rolph, leave it alone!
Erin|  Yeah! Boo-yah!
Pam|  I got it!
Dwight| Pam!
Pam|  Oof!
Jim| You all right?
Pam| Yep. No, no, no, Im fine.
Jim| You sure?
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| Hey, easy, easy...
Charles| Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Pam| No, no, its fine. Just gimme a second.
Charles| I dont know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
David| Yeah.
Jim| All right, you know what? Youre just trying to get rid of our best player.
Charles| Oh, Jim, youre putting a volleyball game in front of your fiances health.
Jim| No, uh-
Pam| Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, lets go, its our ball. Lets go!
Charles| Yeah, I dont think we can let you play with that foot.
Dwight|  Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. Ill stall em.
Charles| I guess thats it for you, Jim.
Jim| All right, you know what?  Lets do this.
Pam| Well be back!
Dwight| Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!!  Ill get it. 
Michael| Probably shouldnt have mentioned Buffalo.
Holly| Hindsight.
Michael| Shouldve had hindsight.
Holly| How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Michael| I think it went well. I think it was good.
Holly| There werent any laughs.
Michael| No, it was a tough audience.
Holly| Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Michael| Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Holly| Well, Im glad we did it.
Michael| Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next years sketch.
Holly| I cant wait.
Jim|  Yeah, shes with the nurse right now, so youll have to stall a little longer... No, dont send in the subs yet... Dwight, I dont know. Think of something!
Nurse| To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
Pam| How long will that take?
Nurse| Oh, shouldnt be too bad, its a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance youre pregnant...
Pam| Im sorry, can we just hurry this up? Ive got a game to get back to.
Nurse| Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to."
Holly| Whatd you think?
AJ| I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
Michael| Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Holly|  Okay. So good to see you.
Michael| Good to see you.  AJ.
AJ| Michael. 
Michael| I didnt find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year shell be with somebody, and the next year, Ill be with somebody, and its gonna take a long time... And then its perfect. Im in no rush.
David| Dwight, come on now, its time to put in the subs.
Charles| Yeah, it looks like Pam wont make it back. Okay?
Dwight| Okay. Fine.
Charles| All right! Come on.
Dwight| Except, you know what? Its not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Andy| Dwight.
Dwight| No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
David| Dwight.
Dwight| Seven? Can I finish please?
David| Okay.
Dwight| Eight?
Jim|  Oh, Dwight, were so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so Ill call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.  Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs!  Ohh!
