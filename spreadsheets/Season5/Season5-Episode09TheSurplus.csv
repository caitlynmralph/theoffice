Oscar| Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Michael| Mmm... okay.
Oscar| As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Michael| Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why dont you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
Oscar| Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Michael| Yes.
Oscar| Right there.
Michael| Theres the x-ax...icks.
Oscar| You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
Michael| Mmhmm, okay.
Oscar| But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next years budget.
Michael| Why dont you explain this to me like Im five.
Oscar| Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Michael| Ho-oh!
Oscar| So you have an extra dollar.
Michael| Yeah.
Oscar| So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Michael| Ill be six.
Oscar| And you ask them for money, theyre gonna give you nine dollars. Cause thats what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Michael| So the dollars a surplus. This is a surplus.
Oscar| We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or itll be deducted from next years budget.
Michael|  Whoo.
Oscar| We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
Michael| Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think Im getting you...
Michael| Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?
Pam| New chairs?
Michael| No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
Oscar| No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Pam| Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
Michael| So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Pam|  Good? Yeah, he said good, Im good...
Oscar| Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Pam| Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Oscar| Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
Pam| Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Michael| Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, lets just decide and agree upon one.
Stanley| Im with Pam. Chairs.
Michael| Alright, so, teams forming.
Toby| We should really have the offices air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Michael| You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Toby| Youll see.
Pam| Michael?
Michael| Yes.
Pam| Ive talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know theyre with me on this.
Jim| Uh, actually, Im gonna go with copier.
Pam| What? Jim.
Jim| Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I dont have to agree on everything.
Meredith| Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Creed| The balls on you, man.
Oscar| So Michael, what do you think?
Michael| Why me?
Jim| You have to make the decision.
Michael| Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, Im going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
Andy| Dwight, Im a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
Dwight| Yeah, do tell.
Andy| I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."
Dwight| Mmhmm.
Andy| "Walk until you hear the beehive."
Dwight| How could it be more clear?
Angela| I think Andy makes an excellent point.
Dwight| Okay.
Angela| But my biggest concern is that theres only one bathroom.
Dwight| Well dig a trench. As long as its downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Angela| Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
Dwight| Well were not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Andy| Lets three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, hows that for a plan?
Andy| Were getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| So um, Ive been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
Jim| Mmhmm.
Pam| I really think you should reconsider.
Jim| Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
Pam| Yeah, I know.
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| But I really think you should reconsider.
Jim| Beesly, are you threatening me?
Pam| Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. Im not threatening you. I love you.  But you should know, youre on very dangerous ground .  All right.
Jim| Okay.
Jim|  Whew.
Dwight| This is where youll have your receiving line. Of course well clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Andy| Hmm... mm, whats that smell?
Dwight| Youre gonna need to be more specific.
Angela| Manure. Get rid of it.
Dwight| Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Angela| Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Dwight| You wanna eat, dont you?
Angela| Honey, say something!
Andy| Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Dwight| ...Ill consider it.
Andy| See? Thats how you do it! Makin progress here.  ...Darn! Heh.
Dwight| Theres a hose out back.
Andy| Okay.
Pam| Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Michael| Yes.
Pam| Well that never happened.
Oscar| Michael?
Michael| I dont know. I havent decided yet.
Oscar| Im just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Michael| Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
Jim| Woah, you guys going to lunch?
Michael| Yes.
Jim| Mind if I join?
Michael| Ohh, God!
Jim| All right.
Michael| Yeah!
Jim| Lets go.
Michael| Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jim| Lets do it.
Michael| All right! Cool!
Jim| Where we going?
Michael| I have no idea.
Pam| So, I guess thats how theyre gonna play this. It is on.  It is so on.
Pam| Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years Ive had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
Oscar|  Stop it! Michael.
Jim| Michael, that is hilarious.
Michael|  Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Oscar| The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. 
Jim| Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Pam| Aww.
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| Thats cool.  Mm, good stuff. 
Jim| You look really pretty.
Pam| Thank you. 
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| Michael?
Michael| Yeah?
Pam| Hey!
Michael| Oh, hey.
Pam| You got a second?
Michael| I do.
Pam| Oh, good.
Pam| Oh, that mustve been so fun.
Michael| it was fun. We had a good time.
Pam| Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
Michael| Oh, thank you.
Pam| Yeah, is that a new tie?
Michael| Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
Pam| That is amazing!
Michael| You think thats good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Pam| What?
Michael| Nine dollars. The boys department.
Pam| No.
Michael| Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Pam|  No way!
Michael| Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
Pam| Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Michael| Yes they were.
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| They were.
Pam| Heres what I was thinking everyone sits on a chair every day...
Michael| Mmhmm.
Pam| But not everyone...
Michael| Sits on a copier.
Pam| Or even uses the copier every day.
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| Yeah, right?
Michael| Very valid.
Pam| ...Thats it. 
Michael| All right.
Pam| All right, see you later...
Michael| See ya.
Pam| Hot tie guy.
Michael|  Hahaha!... well...
Dwight| Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Angela| No. I havent thought of it.
Dwight| Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. Its not that hard.
Angela| I would like cat.
Dwight| Cats dont make butter.
Angela| I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Dwight| It doesnt make any sense.
Angela| Yes it does!
Andy| Okay, guys!
Angela| I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
Dwight| Cow, goat or sheep.
Andy| What is this? All right, were all on the same team. Is it-  Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
Jim|  You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Pam| No, copiers great.
Jim| Yeah?
Pam| Yeah. I have my copies. 
Jim| There they are.
Pam| And I have my original. 
Jim| You got it.
Pam| So suck it.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| Okay.
Kevin| Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope thats okay.
Michael| Oh, thank you my dear.
Kelly| Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Michael| Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
Stanley| There he is!
Michael| There he is! Hello, hello!
Phyllis| Hello.
Michael| Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Jim| Oh!
Michael| Mm!  Yeah!
Pam| Theres that ass!
Michael| Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
Pam| Woo! Yeah. Aw, dont take it away!
Michael| Oh... ah, I almost choked.
Dwight| Heres another place.
Angela| Its beautiful.
Andy| Hey-o!
Dwight| So... why dont we try this out, well see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angelas father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when youre up here.
Andy| 
Angela|  Hello, Im Angela Martin, and-
Andy| Im Andy.
Angela| I work with Dwight.
Dwight| He doesnt understand a word youre saying.
Andy| What?
Dwight| Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad...  And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. Hes explaining why were here, what were doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then hes gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. Hes gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then hes going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do."  And then hes going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Angela| I do.
Dwight| And there we go. Okay, and thats just about it. Man and wife.
Hank| Got a call about a problem up here.
Pam| Did somebody call Hank?
Michael| Hank, thank God youre here. The office is at a crossroads.
Hank| So, theres no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
Michael| Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
Hank| Thank you. Thank you. You know, its nice and warm up here.
Michael| Yes.
Hank| So what are we talking about?
Michael| Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Hank| I know what a surplus is.
Michael| Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, heres the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
Hank| Is that the copier?
Michael| It is, yes.
Hank|  Hmm.
Michael| What?
Hank| I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
Michael| Okay.
Pam| You can try mine.
Michael| Oh, there we go.
Hank| Hmm, not much lumbar support.
Michael| Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
Hank| On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
Michael| So, the copier.
Hank| Well, let me finish.
Michael| All right, yes.
Hank| Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
Michael| Well, what should I do?
Hank| ...Let me see the copier again.
Michael| All right, get out. Get out.
Angela| Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Dwight| I know you did. And thats why I have taken care of everything.
Angela| What do you mean?
Dwight| Well Monkey, hes a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasnt signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
Angela| Dwight! That doesnt count!
Dwight| Yes, of course it does.
Angela| No, it doesnt!
Dwight| It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
Angela| I didnt-
Dwight| Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
Angela| We are not married.
Dwight| Wha...
Angela| Take this thing. 
Dwight| My... Its not my fault you dont understand German; Ive been telling you to take it for years!
Andy| Are we, uh... are we leaving or what?  Ow!
David|  Michael.
Michael| Hey David-  Im sorry. Im sorry. Im eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. Im stopping now.
David| Is this why youre calling me?
Michael| No, no, no, no, no. No. Im calling-  Im sorry.
David| Okay.
Michael| Mm. Im calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
David| You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Michael| No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so Im not the bad guy.
David| Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Michael| The what now?
David| Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Michael| ...Like a tip?  $645?!
Michael| I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
Jim|  We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... Ill double-check that for you.
Michael| All right, attention everyone.
Jim| Let me call you right back. Okay.
Michael| I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
Oscar| Thats the original.
Michael| Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... its a good chair. I think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They dont have copiers. They dont even-  Gah! They dont even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
Oscar| Do you know?
Michael| Do I know what?
Oscar| I think you know.
Michael| Mm, no...
Phyllis| Know what?
Pam| Yeah, know what?
Oscar| Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Michael| $645.
Kevin| Michaels a genius.
Michael| Right.
Oscar| Whyd you say dollars?
Michael| Because that is how my mind works.
Oscar| Whats 15% of 200?  Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Jim| Wait, what?
Pam| You can do that?
Kevin| Hey Michael, whats 394 times 5,912?
Michael| Lets see...
Pam| Youre gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Michael| I dont need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
Oscar| Youre gonna get us a copier then?
Michael| This is so stupid.
Pam| Or chairs?
Michael| This is so, so stupid. And, God...  thats my phone.
Stanley| I didnt hear a phone.
Michael| To be continued!
Michael| No, I dont-this doesnt change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
Andy| Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you.  What-
Angela|  Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
Andy| Was that hot or what?
Pam| So whats it gonna be?
Oscar| Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Pam| Let me just say, youve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
Oscar| You are a smart guy. I know youll do the right thing.
Michael|  You think its easy?
Stanley| Its your job.
Michael| Okay, you know what? Why dont you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise Im taking the bonus. All right?
Michael| It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put em in a room, and you just-  Hey.
Pam| Hey.
Oscar| Hey, were going with the chairs.
Michael| What?
Oscar| I just figured Id rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
Pam| Thanks Michael.
Michael| Good work. Im proud of you.  Mother-
Michael|  What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,  you should know that some people think its cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
Jim| Truce?
Pam| Yeah, I guess, since I won.
Jim| Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, Im going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.  Totally kidding.  Im gonna need four.
