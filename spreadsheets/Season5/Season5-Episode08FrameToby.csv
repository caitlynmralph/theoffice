Angela| Are you swallowing them whole?  Youre eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Kevin|  Yes.
Dwight| Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, Ill stick with my jerkie.
Jim| So why did you come in here?
Dwight| To socialize.  And inform.
Michael| Oh brownies! Im taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Ryan| Youre taking two?
Kelly| Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby. 
Michael| Yeah why dont you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Kelly| Um, Im just gonna hand it to him right now.
Michael| Heh, okay, weirdo.
Jim| Why is that, why is that weird?
Michael| She said she was going to give it to him right now. 
Jim|  Shes probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Michael| Yeah, they used to.
Jim| Toby works here again.
Michael| Oh, can you imagine?
Jim| Oh no.
Michael| Uhhgh.
Jim| You dont know.
Michael| I dont know.  What?
Jim| You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if hes, see if hes back.
Michael| Hmmm, dare I?   You know what? Im going to, for old times sake.   Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. 
Toby| Hi, Micha-
Michael| NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
Michael|  Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
Dwight| He looks great.
Michael| No.
Dwight| Well rested.
Michael| He looks worse.
David| Michael, is everyone okay?
Michael| Uh, well Im afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.  
David| I dont understand, is anyone hurt?
Michael| Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
David| Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
Michael| Yes.
David| All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Michael| I learned a while back that if I dont text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
David| Now what Im curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Michael| I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Dwight| Also, its icky back there.
Michael| Thats true.  People say its icky.
David| Okay, I have to go.
Michael| David, wait.
David| No.
Michael| Is there no way we can get rid of him?
David| Not without cause, Michael.
Michael| I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
David| You have to get along with Toby.
Michael| No.
David| Yep.
Michael| I dont.
David| Goodbye, Michael. 
Michael|  Dont do that.
Pam|  Oh, come on!  Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Andy| So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old mans place?
Jim| Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didnt tell you that.
Andy| Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Jim| Thats really not cool.
Andy| Kaaw!
Kevin| So Jim, youre gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Jim| Yeah, I guess technically Kev, youre right.
Jim| Todays a big day.  Todays the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But its my parents house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  Its got shag carpets.  I mean you cant blame my parents it was the 70s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.   Shes gonna love it.  Right?
Jim| Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Andy| Whoa, you havent told the misses about the castle?  Youre in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
Phyllis| Jim, dont listen to Andy.  I think its so romantic.
Jim| Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Phyllis| Wheres your place?
Jim| Oh, its on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Phyllis| Ohhh...
Creed| Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
Jim| Definitely we should.
Oscar|  "To whoever made the microwave mess the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed."
Andy| That is just obnoxious.
Oscar| No kidding.
Pam| Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
Oscar| The note.  So "holier than thou".
Angela| Hmm, I liked it.
Pam| Dont you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Andy| No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Meredith| Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
Pam| Just because someone likes things clean, doesnt mean theyre rich.
Meredith| Yeh, theyre rich.
Michael| You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
Toby| Well thanks Michael.
Michael| Youre welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Toby| Well thats sweet, I missed you guys too.
Michael| So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
Toby| Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Michael| Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
Toby| ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Michael| Whyd you come back?  Why didnt you stay?
Toby| It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
Michael| I bet, for you.
Toby| And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
Michael|  Shhh hot, why didnt you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
Toby| Are you all right, Michael?
Michael| Yeah, I am.  I am.
Michael| I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like Im dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
Michael| Okay, just summarize.
Dwight| Okay, fireable offenses include workplace violence and sexual harassment.
Michael| Thats it, thats it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
Dwight| I love catching people in the act.  Thats why I always whip open doors.
Michael| Mm.  Me too.  Okay, lets get this started.
Dwight| Okay 
Michael| What are you doing?
Dwight|  I am the bait.
Michael| For what?
Dwight| Men find me desirable.
Michael| No, no, no.
Dwight| Oh, its a good day too. Im wearing my mustard shirt.
Michael| Youre the bait for Toby?
Dwight| Mmhmm.
Michael| No, for one thing, hes not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
Dwight| Men find me desirable.
Michael| Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
Pam| When it comes down to it, its a health issue.  I should have written that. 
Jim| Mmhmm, yeah.
Pam|  Why arent you as mad or interested in this as me?
Jim| Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Pam| Are you inching away from me?
Jim| No.
Pam| Reach your arms out.
Jim|  Im always this close.
Michael| Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Jim| Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Michael| Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. Im kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Pam| What do you need, Michael?
Michael| Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Michael| Good.  N-no no no, dont.
Pam| "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  Im too shy to tell you that I love you."
Michael| Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
Ryan|  You did that for me?
Kelly| Mmhmm.
Ryan| Are you happy you did?
Toby| Hey guys thats really inappropriate.
Ryan|   Whats up?
Michael| Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
Ryan| Yeah, yeah Ill see them.
Michael| Toby can I see those? Ooh.  Whats the matter?  Whats the matter? You scared?
Dwight| Those are fighting words.
Michael| You mad? You mad at me?
Dwight| I hope he doesnt haul off and just hit you.
Michael| Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
Dwight| Hmmm?
Michael| Huh?  He might do it...
Kelly| Punch him, Toby! 
Michael| I dare you to.  Come on.
Dwight| Come on.  Baaah!
Michael| Whats the matter... haaaww!
Dwight| Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Ryan| Yeah, punch him.
Michael| Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, whos side are you on?
Dwight| Ryan.  Come on, man?
Michael| No do it, do it.  I dare you.
Dwight| Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Michael| Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
Toby| Im not going to punch you, Michael.
Dwight| Are you really not going to punch him?
Toby| No, why would I punch you?
Michael| Son of a bitch.
Ryan|  You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Dwight| I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Michael|  Just stop it.  You havent done anything helpful all day.
Dwight| Theres still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Michael| Whats that?
Dwight|  Frame him, for using drugs. 
Michael| Frame him?
Dwight| Yeah, its illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Michael| Ive never framed a man before, have you?
Dwight| Oh Ive framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Michael| Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Michael| Hello.  Ive seen you guys around.  Im Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?   Uhghh, so I guess you know why Im here?  I need to purchase something.
Vance Refrigeration guy| A fridge?
Michael| No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
Vance Refrigeration guy| What?
Michael| Grass, weed?
Leo| What makes you think wed have weed?
Michael| I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
Vance Refrigeration Guy|  Hey, just hold on one second.
Michael| Im not wearing a wire, so...
Leo| Why would you even say that?
Vance Refrigeration Guy|  Hey, thats gonna be 500 dollars.
Michael| How much? How many pounds is it?
Vance Refrigeration Guy| Its- its two pounds.  Im losing money on this man just, give me the money.  Alright, walk away.
Leo| Walk away.
Vance Refrigeration Guy| Walk away.
Ryan| Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; Im totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Pam| Thank you.
Ryan| I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess. 
Pam| I know, can you believe it?
Ryan| Yeah, its crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someones gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Pam| I guess thats why we have a temp, huh?
Ryan| Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
Pam| How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
Ryan| I--- I would find a way.
Pam| Youve seen things cleaned before though, right?
Ryan| I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Kelly| Hi, Michael.
Michael| Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
Dwight|  Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson  and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, thats my name.  See you soon.
Police Officer 1| Hi, we received a call?
Pam| I dont know anything about that.
Police Officer 1| We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.
Pam| Here?
Dwight| Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriffs Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  
Creed| Just pretend like were talking until the cops leave.
Michael| Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder whats going on. 
Dwight| Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Toby| Hey, what is this?
Dwight| Search his things.
Police Officer 2| Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
Toby| Why?
Police Officer 2| Sir, please step away from your desk.
Toby| Hey, whats going on?  You dont have my permission to do this.
Dwight| They dont need your permission, Flenderson, theyve got the companys permission.
Toby| Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Michael| Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
Toby| Dont search my stuff.
Police Officer 1| Sir?
Toby| I have a reasonable right to privacy.
Dwight| Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Toby| Michael!
Michael| Yeah, lets just cancel this, okay?
Police Officer 1| Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
Toby| Oh my God!
Michael| No, no no no... No, no.
Toby| That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Michael| No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
Police Officer 1| Really?
Police Officer 2| Check this out.
Michael| Oh God!
Toby| That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Michael| No, no no no no.
Police Officer 1| Turn around.
Toby| What is going on here?
Michael| God! No, thats not... I dont know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Police Officer 1| Do you have any weapons?
Toby| Of course not!
Michael| Ahh, thats mine.
Dwight| No! Michael, no!
Michael| Yes, its mine.
Police Officer 2| Some basil.  Salad dressing, I think.
Police Officer 1| Salad dressing?
Police Officer 2| Yeah its, uh, a caprese salad.  Theres a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.
Michael| Are you kidding me?  Thats my salad.
Dwight| So wait a minute, theres no drugs?
Police Officer 2| No.
Dwight| Gahh, dammit!  Come on!
Police Officer 1| We got a fake tip.
Dwight| Wait, officers, are you sure you dont want to interrogate him?
Police Officer 1| No.
Dwight|  You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why dont you use them?
Michael| You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Toby| I didnt put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Michael| Hmm.
Toby| Did you?
Michael| Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. 
Toby| You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
Michael| Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, thats who youre worried about?  Youre... youre worried about the cops time?  You think I framed you, and youre worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
Michael| You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
Toby| I did leave.
Michael| Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Toby| Well, I dont see it that way.
Michael| Do you want to hear a lie?
Toby| What?
Michael| I think youre great.  Youre my best friend.
Ryan|  I cant do this.
Kelly| Cant do what?
Ryan| Its not fair to you.  And its really not fair to me.
Kelly| Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Ryan| That was your choice; dont put that on me.  Im just going on a little trip.
Kelly| Oh, can I come?
Ryan| Its not that kind of trip.  Im going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I dont do it now Ill never get to go.  And Ill always resent you for it... you dont want me to resent you, do you?
Kelly| So youre dumping me?
Ryan| Lets be adults about this.  Lets have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Kelly| Okay?
Jim|  Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Pam| Sure.
Jim| Cool.
Pam|  What are we doing at your parents house?
Jim| I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now  open your eyes.  Tadah!
Pam| I dont get it.
Jim| I bought it.  Its ours.  Lets go inside, Ill show you inside.   So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation.   Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.   This is the master bedroom but, Im actually not allowed in here so... 
Jim|  So Im still in the process of converting the garage.  Its got great light in here and Im thinking, it could be perfect  for an art studio.   Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and its doesnt look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand its just---
Pam| I love it.
Jim| You do?
Pam| Yeah, I love it!
Jim| Really?
Pam| I mean, you bought me a house!
Jim| Oh my God...
Pam| You bought me a house!
Jim| Yeah, I did. 
Pam| Um, do we have to sleep in your parents bedroom?
Jim| No, No, well just board that up.  Itll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Pam| And the clown?
Jim| Yeah, I cant... really cant move him.
Dwight| What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffanys at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  Its priceless.  As Im taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  Its her fathers business.  Shes Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I dont trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and hes the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  Shes been waiting for me all these years; shes never taken another lover.  I dont care, I dont show up. I go to Berlin.  Thats where I stashed the chandelier.
