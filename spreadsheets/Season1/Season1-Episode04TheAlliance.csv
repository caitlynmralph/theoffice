Dwight| Michael!?
Michael| Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
Dwight| I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
Michael| Theres no downsizing.
Dwight| I, but if there were, Id be protected as assistant regional manager?
Michael| Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Dwight| Yeah, so I dont have to worry?
Michael| Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing, okay?
Michael| But theres no downsizing, so just dont...
Dwight| Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Michael| Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
Michael| It looks like theres gonna be downsizing. And its part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "Youre fired."  "Youre foir-ed. Uh, youre foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office cant function that way. No way.  "Youre foir-ed."  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "Youre hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But thats unrealistic, so...
Dwight| Its a real shame, cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
Stanley| Whyd you do this?
Dwight| I didnt do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? Whats the scuttlebutt?
Michael| Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
Michael| Who is it? Whos the birthday?
Pam| Um... Actually, we dont have any staff birthdays coming up.
Michael| Next person on the...
Pam| Oh.
Michael| ...calendar.
Pam| Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
Michael| Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Pam| But its not until next month.
Michael| Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, itll be a surprise.
Pam| You still want to have a party?
Michael| Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Michael|  Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
Phyllis| Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... its stupid, forget it.
Angela| What?
Phyllis| I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but thats dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Angela| No, yeah, I think thats a good idea.
Phyllis| Yeah?
Angela| What color do you guys think?
Phyllis| Well, theres green, um, blue... yellow... red... 
Pam| How about green?
Angela| I think green is kind of whoreish.
Pam| This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her.
Michael| These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing 80s party last year. Off the hook!
Michael| So I was thinking, if you havent already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
Angela| Merediths allergic to dairy, so... 
Michael| Shes not the only one thats going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. Its not, uh, its not just about her, so...
Pam| It is... her birthday.
Michael| Mint chocolate chip! Thatd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
Dwight| Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Dwight| Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Jim| Absolutely, I do.
Dwight| Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out whos vulnerable and whos protected...
Jim| At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Dwight| Did you get your tickets?
Jim| To what?
Dwight| The gun show. 
Jim| And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, heres a way."
Dwight| Theres one other thing and this is important. Lets keep this alliance totally a secret. Dont tell anyone.
Pam| An alliance?
Jim| Oh yeah.
Pam| What does that even mean?
Jim| I think it has something to do with Survivor, but Im not sure.
Jim| Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Dwight| Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Dwight| Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
Jim| What? No.
Dwight| Just now.
Jim| What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. Im using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Dwight| Right, thats good, good, pursue this.
Jim| Well Im trying to. Do you see what Im doing?
Dwight| Mmm hmm.
Jim| But listen, Im going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Dwight| Done.
Jim| All right.
Michael|  Can you get her? Shes right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Merediths card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, lets see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard youre turning 46, but, come on, youre an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I dont appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, heres the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. Ive already set the bar really high. And theyre all worried about their jobs, you know. Its kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. Youre great. Love, Michael." 
Dwight| They seem awfully chummy, dont you think?
Jim| Yeah, what do you think thats about?
Dwight| Only one way to find out.
Jim| Im on it.
Jim| You are not going to believe this.
Dwight| What? I believe it.
Jim| Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
Dwight| I could tell, from the body language.
Jim| Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Kevin| Italian.
Jim| Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Kevin| Yeah.
Jim| Toby and Kevin, theyre trying to get Angela kicked off.
Dwight| Good, let em. It helps our cause.
Jim| Well, I dont know, if Kevins in accounting, and Tobys in Human Resources and theyre talking...
Dwight| Oh, theyre forming an alliance
Toby| I love their sandwiches.
Jim| I love their sandwiches too.
Kevin| Their breads really good.
Jim| Their bread is very good.
Dwight| Damn it. God!
Jim| OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Dwight| God... Damn it! Why us?
Jim| Because were strong, Dwight. Because were strong.
Michael|  Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Dont bring that lamb to work or itll poop on the floor.
Michael| Hey, Oscar! Come on in. Whats up?
Oscar| Uh, Im sorry to bother you.
Michael| Oh, not at all. Come on in. Whats going on?
Oscar| My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe youd like to... you know... if...
Michael| What?
Oscar| Donate to the charity?
Michael| Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Oscar| Thank you.
Michael| No, Im always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
Oscar| Thats... thats... thats very generous.
Michael| Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. Thats what I say, so...
Pam|  Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
Jim| Sure, whats up?
Pam| Um, I dont know, Im just like, Im going a little crazy cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
Jim| Oh no?
Pam| Yeah, hes making me take notes on these meetings and Im, like, "These people are my friends." But hes all like, "This is confidential. You cant tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me youre not gonna say anything.
Jim| No, will not, Im not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Pam| OK, yeah.
Dwight| Jackpot.
Jim| That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
Michael|  Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Dwight| Hey, you wanted to see me?
Michael| Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Dwight| I dont think shed be missed.
Michael| Theres not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Dwight| Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Michael| I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Dwight| She had a hysterectomy.
Michael|  Which one is that again?
Dwight| Thats where they remove the uterus.
Michael| Oh God! Dwight, no. Im trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Dwight| It could be kind of funny.
Michael| You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. Ill work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
Jim| OK, heres the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Merediths birthday.
Dwight| Oh my God, we have to be there.
Jim| I know, but its gonna be a little tough because theres no good place to hide there.
Dwight| No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
Jim| What? What?
Dwight| I know. I know exactly what to do.
Jim|  Great.
Dwight| Im a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
Dwight| This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Jim| Good.
Ryan| Michael? Are you done yet?
Michael| Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Lets go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
Jim| Wait, this isnt gonna work. The lids open.
Dwight| So tape it down.
Jim| I cant do that. You wont be able to breathe.
Dwight| Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, Ill poke holes in the box.
Jim| Thank you, thank you. OK.
Everybody| Surprise!
Meredith| Oh! Surprise.
Angela| No, its ah...
Michael| Its surprise Meredith. One, two...
Everybody|  Happy birthday to you.
Michael| Find a key.
Everybody| Happy birthday...
Jim| So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
Dwight| No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people dont notice were both gone.
Jim| Right... Thats good.
Dwight| Can I trust Jim? I dont know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I dont. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Everybody|  ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you...
Michael| And many more!
Stanley| Last year, five years ago...
Michael| You were surprised, werent you?
Meredith| Yes.
Michael| You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hells goin on here?" Good cake. Why dont you have some?
Meredith| Uh, I cant. Um...
Michael| Come on. A little bit.
Meredith| I cant eat dairy.
Michael| Oh, right. God, too bad. Its so good.
Meredith| Yeah, it makes me sick.
Michael| You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think Id kill myself. Cause this is way, way too good.
Pam| Hes in a box?
Jim| Pam, hes in a box. Hes downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. Im serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Pam|  Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just dont know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
Dwight|  Oh.
Michael| Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Jim| Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscars charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Michael| Well, you know, money isnt everything Jim. Its not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe youll give more than three dollars next time.
Jim| Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. Its gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I cant even calculate what youre gonna have to give.
Michael| Is Oscar around?
Michael| I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didnt think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
Oscar| Well, thats what a walk-a-thon is.
Michael| I know...
Oscar| It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile."
Michael| Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Oscar| I just think its kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Michael| No, no, no, no, no. That wasnt what I wasnt, that wasnt... No. It-it-its not about the money. Its just... it... its the ethics of the thing, Oscar. Hows your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Oscar| Yeah.
Michael| How many miles did he do last year?
Oscar| Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Michael| Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
Pam| Happy Birthday. 
Michael| Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Meredith| "Happy Bird-day" Um... "Meredith, good news. Youre not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still."
Michael|  I dont know about that.
Meredith| That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday, youre the best. Love, Pam."
Michael|  Huh! Thanks, downer.
Meredith| This is from Michael. "Meredith, lets hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age."
Michael| Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because youre gettin old.
Meredith| No, I... I get it. Its funny.
Michael|  You didnt get the joke. So, thats cool. Thats, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didnt use. Um... Oh, wheres that? Oh, OK, heres a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." Cause Merediths been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Meredith| Youre right. Youre right. Yes.
Michael| Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
Oscar| How old is she?
Michael| Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
Everybody| How old is she?
Michael| "Shes so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
Michael| That wasnt even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, dont get mad at me.
Oscar| Uh, nice party Michael.
Michael| This isnt my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
Angela| Phyllis wanted red, I didnt.
Phyllis| Oh, boy... You...
Michael| OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think were losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasnt gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscars nephews... walkathon. $25.
Oscar| Per mile.
Michael| Per mile, yes.
Michael| When I retire, I... dont want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
Michael| A check for the kids, and for the team. 
Michael| I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I dont, I dont know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott."  "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because Im him."
Oscar| Thank you, Michael.
Michael| Come here.  Dont cash that till Friday, OK?
Toby| Really? Today?
Ryan| Yeah.
Toby| Oh, Happy Birthday.
Ryan| Thanks.
Toby| Yeah, I could say something.
Ryan| No, dont. Dont do that.
Jim| OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
Pam| Oh, tell me, tell me.
Jim| OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
Jim| But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Pam|  Thats perfect!
Jim| If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Roy|  What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
Jim| No, no, dude, no.
Pam| Hey, Hey!
Jim| No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
Pam| Come on.
Jim| God, I dont even, I dont even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... weve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Pam| Its just office pranks.
Jim| Its stupid. Its, its just office pranks.
Roy|  An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
Dwight| I have absolutely no idea.
Roy| Come on.
Dwight| Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. Thats the game. Convince him were in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Dwight|  Thats politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
