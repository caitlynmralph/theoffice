Michael| Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Pam| Im not making any copies.
Michael| Lets go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Pam| Nothing new.
Michael| Lay them on me. What?
Pam| Theres nothing new.
Michael| Thats not what you said earlier.
Pam| Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... 
Michael| The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? Thats what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
Jan| So, which health plan have you decided on?
Michael| I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Jan| Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Michael| I think it was you who didnt look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Jan| The Gold Plan? Im not even on that plan.
Michael| Well, Id recommend it. Its very good.
Jan| Michael.
Michael| You gotta crack these things open.
Jan| You know the whole reason that were doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Michael| Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It wont be popular decision around the old orifice.
Jan| Its your job. So...
Michael| Well, its a suicide mission, you know.
Jan| Michael... maybe... I mean...
Michael| There, there...
Jan| Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Michael|  When have you ever done that?
Jan| Im doing it right now. To you.
Jim| Last night on Trading Spouses, theres... have you seen it?
Pam| No. I have a life.
Jim| Interesting, whats that like?
Pam| You should try it sometime.
Jim| Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Pam| ... your problem.
Michael| Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
Michael| Theres a decision that needs to be made, and Im having an unbelievably a busy day. So Im going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Jim| Gosh.
Michael| Yeah!
Jim| That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Michael| Really?
Jim| Yeah. I just dont think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Jim| Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Dwight| Yes. I can do it. Im your man.
Jim| Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, Id have to throw myself in front of a train.
Dwight| OK, first, lets go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Michael| Ah, none. Youre picking a health care plan.
Dwight| OK, well table that for the time being. Two, Ill need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Michael| You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Dwight|  Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his.
Michael| Nope, you cannot use it.
Dwight| OK, I take it back, its a workspace.
Michael| Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Dwight| Thank you.
Michael| If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and weve talked about that already.
Dwight| What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I dont believe in coddling people.
Dwight| In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I cant run. A lion eats me and Im dead." Well, Im not dead. Im the lion. Youre dead.
Stanley| Theres no dental, theres no vision, theres a $1,200 deductible.
Pam| Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael|  Pam, Michael Scott. Hows tricks?
Pam| Where are you?
Michael| Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears Im busy, busy, busy. Cant step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybodys doing. Everybody cool out there?
Pam| Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out cause the... 
Michael| Pam! Whoa, whoa, Im sorry, Im sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. Im getting a call.
Pam| No youre not.
Michael| I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just dont let anybody in my office under any conditions today. Im just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Pam| OK.
Michael| Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Pam| Still no one calling. 
Pam| Dwight, what... 
Dwight| Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
Jim| It says "workspace".
Dwight| Same thing.
Jim| If its the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
Dwight| Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Jim| You are not my superior.
Dwight| Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Jim| I thought it was a workspace?
Pam| OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
Dwight| Yes. And my decision in final.
Pam| This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Dwight| Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Jim| You cut more than you had to, didnt you?
Dwight| Sure.
Jim| Well, why did you do that? You work here, dont you want good insurance?
Dwight| Dont need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Jim| OK, well, if youve never been sick, then you dont have any antibodies.
Dwight| I dont need them. Superior genes. Im a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Pam| Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Dwight| So I can lower it.
Oscar| He literally wont come out of his office.
Kevin| Hes got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Angela| Kevin! Thats inappropriate. 
Oscar| Michael, can I talk to you?
Michael| Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Meredith| Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael| Ah, what? Which memo?
Pam| Dwights health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael| Is it a good plan?
Dwight| Its a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Oscar| Its like a pay decrease.
Pam| Michael, he made huge cuts.
Michael| Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
Dwight| Yeah, you said... 
Michael| No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why dont you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
Dwight| I can handle that.
Michael| OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, theres some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
Oscar| This is not good.
Angela| Its ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
Oscar| What was that?
Angela| You let him walk all over you. Its just pathetic.
Kevin| What are you guys talking about?
Angela| Nothing, Kevin.
Michael| Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesnt matter. The point is, theyre not unhappy anymore. Theyre out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. Hes cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... 
love| him.
Dwight| OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what Id like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and Ill see what I can do.
Jim| OK, you know what Dwight? We cant write our diseases down for you because thats confidential.
Dwight| OK, well, I didnt say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, dont write any disease down at all and it wont be covered. Sound fair? Good. Ill be in my office.
Jim| Workspace.
Michael| You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Pam| Where are you going?
Michael| Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldnt find the knob.
Michael| So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
Travel Agent| I dont know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
Michael| Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
Jim| Wait. What are you writing? Dont write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cause Im suffering from both.
Pam| Im inventing new diseases.
Jim| Oh, great.
Pam| So, lets say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Jim| I thought you said you were inventing diseases? Thats spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Pam| Nice.
Jim| Thank you.
Michael|  Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Man on Phone| You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? Its not really a ride.
Michael| Its says here that its a 300ft drop.
Man on Phone| It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Michael| So its not a free fall?
Man on Phone| Its an industrial coal elevator.
Michael| Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
Michael| OK, so I dont know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway? 
Dwight| Damnit! Damnit Jim! 
Dwight| All right, who did this? Im not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. 
Jim| What are you talking about?
Dwight| Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Jim| OK, whoa. Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that theyre fake?
Dwight| Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Dwight| You did this, didnt you?
Jim| Absolutely not.
Dwight| Yes you did.
Jim| No I didnt.
Dwight| I know it was you. Fine. You know what? Ill have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Jim| Killer nanorobots?
Pam| Its an epidemic.
Dwight| The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition wont receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.  "Count Choculitis"
Jim| Sounds tough.
Dwight| Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Jim| Do you?
Dwight| I think you need to confess... 
Jim| Mmm hmm.
Dwight| ...the fact...
Jim| Yep.
Dwight| What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Jim| Good luck. 
Dwight| Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... 
Stanley|  ...the light green or green...
Jim|  Jim Halpert.
Dwight| Let me out.
Jim| Who is this?
Dwight| Let me out or youre fired.
Jim| No, you cant fire me.
Dwight| Yes I can. Im manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Jim| OK, can you hold on? Im getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert.
Pam|  Hey, Jim. Its Pam.
Jim| Hey Pam! How are you?
Dwight| Jim! Open the door!
Pam| Good, how are you? Busy?
Jim| Im doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
Dwight| Jim!
Pam| Um, Im not bothering you, am I?
Jim| No, not at all.
Pam| You dont have anything youre doing?
Jim| I have nothing to do.
Dwight| Jim!
Pam| Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. Im not really doing anything.
Dwight| Jim!
Jim| Oh yeah?
Pam| I might go to the mall.
Jim| The mall?
Dwight| Jim!
Pam| I need new shoes.
Jim| Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Jan| Hello?
Dwight| Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Jan| This is Jan.
Dwight| Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Jan| Who is this?
Dwight| Dwight Schrute.
Jan| From sales?
Dwight| Well...
Jan| Wheres Michael Scott?
Dwight| He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Jan| Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Dwight| Thats not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Jan| Really?
Dwight| Yeah.
Jan| OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Dwight| Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
Jan| No. Please dont use my cell phone ever again.
Dwight| Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... 
Michael| Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. Its all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why dont you take two? Because you dont get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Ryan| Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Michael| Why dont you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Stanley| Oh, thanks.
Michael| There you go.
Stanley| This isnt the big surprise, is it? Because weve been having a pretty horrible day.
Michael| Uh, nope. Nope. This isnt the surprise. Its surprising, um... because you didnt expect it. But you will... youll know it when you see it.
Dwight| Michael. Michael?
Michael|  Oh, Christ.
Dwight| I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Dwight| Im now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
Stanley| What about confidentiality?
Dwight| You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Meredith| Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
Dwight| I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Meredith| A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Dwight| OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. Ill make sure thats covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Kevin| Thats a real thing.
Dwight| Yeah, but no one here has it.
Kevin| Someone has it.
Kevin| Do you think we should go ?
Oscar| I dont know, Kevin. This is important. I dont want...  There he is.
Kevin| What is he doing?
Oscar| I dont know.
Oscar| Well?
Michael| Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Oscar| OK, the health care plan.
Pam| Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Michael| Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Dwight| I most certainly did not.
Michael| Oh come on! Thats horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, its after five. Oh, oh its awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Angela| What about the surprise?
Michael| Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Stanley| We all think you dont have a surprise.
Michael| All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
Michael| When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
Michael|  God, yeah... Ah! This...
Michael| Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  "Hi. Im Mork from Ork." Well, Im Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
Dwight| Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
