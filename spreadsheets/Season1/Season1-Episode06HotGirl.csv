Jim| Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, Youre both um, salesmen. I mean thats something right there. 
Dwight| True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. 
Jim| Its all gold. 
Katy| Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They dont know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
Jim| Alright. Heres the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back. 
Dwight| Whats that?
Jim| You buy a purse. 
Dwight| I dont want a purse. Purses are for girls. 
Jim| Dwight, thats not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? 
Dwight| No.
Jim| Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them. 
Dwight| Like those? 
Jim| Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.

Katy|  Come back...
Michael| Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.

Katy| Wow. Is that for the office? 
Michael| Oh, I know what youre thinking. Youre not prying this out of my hands, but dont tempt me because Ill give it to you!
Katy| I wouldnt think of it.
Michael| Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. Its a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. Its not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper! 
Michael|  Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? Whats the matter? 
Katy| Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me. 
Michael| Oh, oh! God. Im sorry. Is there...? 
Katy| Oh no, its um...
Michael| Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
Katy| No...
Michael| Seriously. No, really.  
Katy| No. I really dont want to inconvenience you. 
Michael| God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean Im out of here at five sharp. 
Katy| At five? 
Michael| I can go earlier. Cause Im the boss. You know, whatever. Im out of here slaves. 
Katy| Okay. 
Michael| What?
Katy| Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay. 
Michael| Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five oclock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home. 
Katy| Okay. Cool. 
Michael| Excellent. 
Katy| Cool. 
Michael| Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay. 
Michael| I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
Dwight| Its actually better this way. 
Michael| No its not. Because I could just click on the icon and then Im onto--- 
Dwight| Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know its against the rules and everything. Because...
Michael| No, no, no its not against the rules.  Shes not a permanent employee so its not. 
Dwight| Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.  
Michael| But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. 
Dwight| What?
Michael| She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. 
Dwight| Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab? 
Michael| Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
Dwight| Please. Please, I am your inferior and Im asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? 
Michael| No. I cannot promise you that. 
Dwight| You cannot promise me, or you wont promise me?  
Michael| Listen, Dwight. 
Dwight| Do you love her? 
Michael|  Dwight, no. I dont know. Its too early to tell. I dont know how I feel. 
Katy| I think youve made a really good choice, shes really going to like that. 
Stanley| Hmmm...
Michael| Espresso?
Katy| Oh, thank you. 
Michael| Youre welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Stanley| Is that from the machine that was in your office? 
Michael| Ummm-hmmm...
Stanley| I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson. 
Michael| Very easy to clean. 
Michael| Okay. Like hes going to win anyway, right? 
Michael| Did we get any mail? 
Pam| Yeah, I gave it to you.
Michael| Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin. Just checkin, double checkin, checkin on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
Pam| So, can I..? 
Michael| Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
Jim| A futon? 
Pam| 
Jim| Hes a grown man 
Pam| Thats what he said. 
Jim| Thats sad. Or its innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. 
Roy| Whats up?
Pam|  Hi. 
Roy| Are you still mad at me? 
Pam| Roy...
Roy| Come on 
Pam| Cut it out.
Roy| Come on, you mad at me? 
Pam| Stop it. 
Roy| Are you still mad at me now? 
Pam|  Cut it out. 
Roy| Are you mad at me now? 
Pam| Stop.   
Roy| Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding. 
Pam|  Stop, I cant breathe. 
Roy| I was just kidding.  You know I didnt mean it. I cant...
Pam| Jim is a great guy. Hes like a brother to me.  Were like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone. 
Katy| You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet? 
Angela| I dont like to necessarily touch things. Im just... Im shopping. 
Katy| Oh no, its fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? Its really uh, kind of festive. Its got a lot of personality. 
Angela| Yeah, uh no. 
Dwight| Hey, hows it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? 
Katy| I dont think so Im really busy. 
Dwight| It will just take a second.
Katy| I cant. 
Dwight| Just for a minute. 
Katy| I really cant. 
Dwight| Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date. 
Katy| No. 
Dwight| Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date? 
Katy| Both. 
Katy| What colors do you like? 
Angela| Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal. 
Michael| Ryan.
Ryan| Yeah.
Michael| Would you like to help me with a special project? 
Ryan| I would love to. 
Michael| Alright. 
Michael|  Okay, just throw out all the empties.
Ryan| You dont want to recycle them? 
Michael| Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. 
Ryan| Do you want this? 
Michael| No. 
Ryan| What about this bottle of power drink? 
Michael| Uh, what flavor? 
Ryan| Blue. 
Michael| Blues not a flavor. 
Ryan| It says flavor Blue Blast. 
Michael| Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you. 
Jim| Hi.

Jim| I do. Thats what Im best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, lets talk about purses. 
Katy| Okay, um...
Jim| Katy but you know what, dont try to sell me one. Okay, seriously cause Im just here to learn. 
Katy| Okay.  
Jim| Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can... 
Katy| Okay. 
Michael| What, stop! Whoa! Thats my Drakkar Noir. 
Ryan| No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept. 
Michael| No, it is a perfect smell-alike. Im not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. 
Ryan| Well, its empty. 
Michael| Not its not, theres some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out. 
Ryan| Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?  
Michael| Thats over several months, Ryan. 
Ryan|  Still. 
Jim| Whats up? 
Pam| Im bored. 
Jim| Thank you for choosing me.

Jim| Ah, well I think Im gonna see Katy. 
Pam| Really? 
Jim| Yeah. 
Pam| What are you guys going to do? 
Jim| Oh, man I dont know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
Pam| Thats great.
Jim| And stuff... yeah. 
Pam| Thats cool.

Pam| Uh, huh. Yes.
Jim| That is cool. Well, Ill see you Monday though, right? 
Pam| Great. 
Jim| Okay. 
Pam| Okay, Im gonna head back. 
Jim| Alright. 
Michael| I think in order to be a ladies man, its imperative that people dont know youre a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I dont know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I dont know. I dont know. Maybe theyre right?  I dont know. 
Michael| Sure you dont want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
Katy| Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you. 
Michael| See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. 
Jim| Goodnight, Michael. 
Michael| Where you going? 
Jim| I dont know. Grab a drink, I think? 
Michael| With us? 
Katy| I uh, I probably should have told you, I dont need a ride now cause Jim can take me home after so youre off the hook. 
Michael| Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Jim| I got this. 
Michael| Alright, have fun.
Katy| Thanks.
Jim| I got it.
Michael| Dont drink and drive.
Michael| Take it easy. 
Jim| Have a good night. 
Michael| You too, have a good night. 
Katy| You got that? 
Jim| Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so its lighter. 
Katy| Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Jim| Alright now, Im gonna warn you. Dont freak out, okay?  
Katy| Why?
Jim| This is a really nice car. In case you havent noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. 
Katy| Its a... its a very nice car. 
Jim| Youre not going to freak out? 
Michael| Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? Id pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
