Michael|  Hey, you ready?
Michael| All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent. 
Dwight| Michael! 
Michael| Today at lunchtime were going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed theyd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun."  And so I started messing around and... Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, its really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Michael| Pam, Pam, thank you maam. Messages, please. Thank you.
Dwight| Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
Michael| No. And thats not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Dwight| Oh, please.
Michael|  When I let him come to my pick-up game...
Dwight| I apologized for that.
Michael|  I vouched for you.
Dwight| Michael, I...
Michael| I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, heres what Im going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Dwight| I can handle that.
Michael| Good. Excellent, itll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so were going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobodys gonna want to do it and I know everybodys gonna complain and bitch and I dont want to have to deal with that.
Dwight| And thats why you have an assistant regional manager.
Michael| Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Dwight|  Same thing.
Michael| No, its not. Its lower, so... 
Dwight| Its close.
Dwight| So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
Jim| God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power Ive ever seen go to someones head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Phyllis| Keep me out of it.
Pam| My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesnt make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? Im kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
Michael| All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But dont you call it that, Ive earned the right.
Ryan| Fine, dont worry about that.
Michael| And here we have "Mister Rogers Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. Hes temping upstairs.
Lonny| Whats up?
Michael| And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
Darryl| Its not my real name.
Michael| No, its Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
Ryan| Darryl Rogers?
Darryl| Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
Michael|  And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
Ryan| Yeah, yeah.
Michael| You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her its part of the job!  Rapport!
Pam|  No, no, I know that the warrantys expired, but isnt it supposed to last longer than two years if it isnt defective? OK, fine, three years.
Jim| Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
Michael| So, um, one oclock sharp and weve got a game on.
Darryl| Were loading at one.
Michael| Oh, I see, youre chickening out on me. Youre bailing on me.
Darryl| No, we got a truck going out at 115. So, thats the busy time.
Michael| Oh, well, Im glad that some time is a busy time because whenever Im down here it doesnt seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you cant take it. OK, fine, have it your way. 
Darryl| All right, fine, you know what? One oclock.
Michael| All right, see you at one.
Michael| Are we ready for the game?
Everybody|  Yeah.
Michael| I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Dwight| Gimli.
Michael| Nerd. That is why youre not on the team.
Dwight| Just trying to be helpful.
Michael| Uh,  "Ill help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
Jim| Thats him.
Michael| OK, so, lets put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
Stanley| Im sorry?
Michael| Um, what do you play? Center?
Stanley| Why "of course"?
Michael| Uh...
Stanley| Whats that supposed to mean?
Michael| Uh, I dont know. I dont remember saying that.
Jim| Uh, I heard it.
Michael| Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
Phyllis| Id like to play if its just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Michael|  Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
Ryan| But, Im getting paid to skip lunch?
Michael| Yes.
Ryan| OK.
Michael| Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
Oscar| I can help out, if you need me.
Michael| I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
Kevin| I have a hoop in my driveway.
Michael| No.
Phyllis| I have a sports bra.
Michael| No, no, ridiculous.
Dwight| Michael, look. 
Michael|  Off the backboard!
Pam| Please dont throw garbage at me.
Michael| Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Pam| I dont think so Michael. Besides, I cant cheer against my fiance.
Jim| Ill do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Michael| Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Pam| Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Michael| Oh, yeah right.
Phyllis| Ill do it.
Michael| Oh, yuck, thats worse than you playing. ... Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. Thats where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, youre on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
Michael| Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Darryl| Just getting a tea bag.
Michael| Oh ho, oh, hes running. Hes running. Hes running, but he cant hide because you know what? One oclock, you better bring your A game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Darryl| Why dont we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farleys.
Michael| Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, Im gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
Darryl| No, thats not as much fun. You know what?
Michael| What?
Darryl| Youre on.
Michael| OK. Cool, youre on.  Dont screw this up.
Michael|  Classic beginners mistake, eating before a game.
Angela| Has anyone seen the first-aid kit?  How many times have I told you? Im the safety officer, not you.
Jim| Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And Im, yeah, Im looking forward to playing. You know, I think Im gonna impress a few people in here.
Jim| You coming down?
Pam| Yeah, Im just forwarding the phones.
Jim| You gonna wish me luck?
Pam| Yeah, youre gonna need it.
Jim| Whoa.
Jim| Is that trash talk from Pam?
Pam|  Im just saying, Roy is very competitive.
Jim| Oh.
Pam| And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so... 
Jim| Well, Im going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because Im also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Pam| Um, I think Im gonna be up at the lake.
Jim| I think Ill see you at the mall. Yeah.
Michael| Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, lets bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, youre fired. Thats a joke.  OK, lets do it.
Jim| Have a good game man.
Roy| Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
Michael| All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
Ryan| I stretched before I came.
Michael| OK.
Michael| OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
Jim| Really? I thought Id take Roy.
Michael| Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
Dwight|  OK, well be skins!
Michael| Aw, come on Dwight.
Dwight| What? Shirts on or off?
Michael| On. Just put it on.
Dwight| You sure?
Michael| Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why dont you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Roy| Dont listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or youre sleeping in the car.
Michael| Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Whos on him? Somebody get him!
Teammates| Yeah!

Michael|  OK, foul. Charging. Charging. Thats a foul.
Roy| OK.
Michael| OK, Ill take it.  OK.
Michael| When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. Its gone, Im in the zone.
Michael|  What is wrong with me today?!
Michael| Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I dont know... I might just be a basketball machine. Whats Dunder Mifflin? Ive never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, thats probably gonna happen, actually.
Michael| Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!
Jim| My bad.
Darryl|  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
Lonny|  Where you at? Where you at? You over there? Im over there.

Michael|  Nice! Come here! 
Ryan| Can we just do one? Thats cool, thats fine.
Darryl| You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.

Warehouse worker| Watch your back Madge.
Madge| Hey! Come on man!
Michael| Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
Dwight|  Yeah!  In your face!
Madge| Yeah, like that counts.
Michael| You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
Michael| Football is like rock and roll, its just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? Youre kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. Its all downbeat, its in the pocket, its like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
Michael|  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
Roy|  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.

Michael| Whats going on? Whats going on? Youre playing like a bunch of girls.
Jim| You know what? Let me take Roy.
Michael| All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
Michael| Shoot, shoot it.   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
Darryl| Block, block, block!
Madge| Hes afraid of you now.
Michael|  Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
Michael|  Yes!

Worker| Im sorry. You all right?
Michael| Oh, that hurts.
Worker| Sorry, I didnt mean to do that.
Michael| Whats your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Darryl| Take your shot man!
Michael| No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
Worker| No it wasnt.
Michael|  Yes, it was. You know what, Im just being fair.
Worker| Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up...
Michael| Game over. Game over. That is it! Im sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, thats just... were having a friendly game. Its a shame. This is a damn shame, but were like a family here and that just, that wont fly.
Angela| This is a cold pack...
Dwight| Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. 
Michael| Thanks Dwight.
Lonny| Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? Whats going on?
Michael| Well, lets just say whoever was ahead won.
Darryl| That was you.
Michael| It was us? Really? I didnt, I didnt know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
Roy| No, no, no, Im not coming in on Saturday.
Darryl| Yeah, this isnt happening.
Michael| Um... well, you guys, you know, Im the boss so...
Lonny| So whats that? Were coming in on Monday, right?
Michael| Hey, hey...
Lonny| Monday?
Michael|  You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that wouldve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. Im embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, were coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
Jim|  ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
Pam| Mmm-hmm.
Jim| I didnt sign anything.
Roy| Hey baby.
Pam| Hey.
Roy|  Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Pam| Yeah, hes, uh, pretty good, huh?  Lets get you into a tub.
Roy| Yeah? Lets get you into a tub.
Michael| Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
Oscar| What time do we have to come in?
Michael| Come on. Lets not be gloomy here man. Were all in this together. Were a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobodys coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
Michael| The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you dont win. But we did because we were ahead.
