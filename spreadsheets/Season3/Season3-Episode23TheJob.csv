Michael|  David!
David|  Oh, Michael?
Michael| Are we all set?
David| Isnt our interview tomorrow?
Michael| Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought Id drop in and say hello.
David| You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Michael| Thought Id catch a show.
David| In the middle of a work day?
Michael| Naaah. You know what? Since Im here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
David| Okay.
Michael| Um, how many people are you interviewing?
David| Were only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Michael| Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
David| I dont think so.
Michael| Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
David| I believe we put you in charge.
Michael| Ah, great. No further questions.
David| Okay, Michael.
Michael| Okay.
David| Im really looking forward to our interview.
Michael| And Im really looking forward to working with you.
Michael| I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. Ill be like three hours late.
Kevin|  Hey.
Jim| Hey, Kev.
Kevin| Whats different about you? You look worse.
Jim| Thank you.
Meredith| You got a haircut. Its sexy, hot.
Jim| Ohhh...
Meredith| Turn around.
Jim| No.
Meredith| Yes.
Jim| No way.
Meredith| Do it!
Andy| Blup-dup-do. Whats up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Jim|  Andy...
Andy| What is it, Big Haircut?
Jim| Nothing.
Andy| Sorry, I cant hear you Big Haircut.
Jim| Yup.
Andy| What?
Jim| Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Pam| Hey. I think it looks great.
Jim| Thanks, Pam.
Pam| After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where hes coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you.
Michael|  Yeah.
Dwight| You wanted to see me?
Michael| Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight| But thats my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Dont screw the pooch.   Thank you.
Michael| Okay. Uh...
Dwight|  Thank you, Michael.
Michael| Uh, okay.
Dwight|  Thank you so much.
Michael| Stop crying.
Dwight|  Thank you.
Michael| Ohhhhh...
Pam| Hey.
Karen| Hey.
Pam| Um, about the beach...
Karen| Its okay, we all say things without thinking.
Pam| Oh, no its not that, Ive actually been thinking that for a long time, and Im glad I said it. I just... Im sorry if it made you feel weird.
Karen|  Oh. Okay.
Karen| Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Karen| Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Jim| Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, lets do it.
Jim| So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Michael| Why so you can do it?
Karen|
Jim| Whoops.
Michael| No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Jim| Hmmm.
Karen| Heh.
Michael| Moon each other.
Jim| Ah, were gonna go tonight, but were gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Michael| All right.
Jim| All right.
Michael| Your loss.
Karen| Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Michael| Cruise control.
Karen| Oh.
Kevin| So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Jim| Yeah, Im not going to talk about this now.
Kevin| Pam is taller.
Jim| You sure?
Kevin| Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
Jim| Wow.
Kevin| I think Karen has a prettier face.
Jim| Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else?
Kevin| Well I mean Pams face is really pretty too. Its a very tough call.
Jim| Hm. Really tough call.
Kevin| Yeah.
Jim| You know what? Why dont you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Kevin| Will do.
Jim| All right.
Oscar| Hey, Pam Ive been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship.
Pam| Wow, very funny.
Stanley| Ive never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Kelly| Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Pam|
Meredith| You know what? Dont even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Creed| I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Creed| www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Ryan| Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creeds brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. Ive read some of it. Even for the intranet its... pretty shocking.
Michael| There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Kevin| Do you think its gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Michael| No. Not at all. I havent talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Oscar| Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Michael| No, no, no. You know what? Its a done deal. I basically have the job already. Theres nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Oscar| Michael...
Kevin| What?
Angela| Why?
Oscar| Im sorry, that just doesnt make sense.
Michael| Yes, I...
Angela| Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Kevin| Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Michael| I have to buy another place.
Angela| But you said you were in debt.
Oscar| Youre not sure that you have the job.
Michael| I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
Dwight| How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Angela| No Dwight, I dont care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Dwight| No, no, not Michael.  Me. Im taking his job.
Angela|  Not now.  Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Dwight|  Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Jim| Oh hey, Dwight.
Dwight| I am gonna be your new boss.  Its my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Jim| Does my room have cable?
Dwight| No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Jim| Can I change rooms?
Dwight| Sorry, were all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Jim| Can I have a late checkout?
Dwight| Ill have to talk to the manager.
Jim| Youre not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Dwight| Im the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Jim| Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Dwight| Yeah, but I havent told you my salary yet.
Jim| Go.
Dwight| Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Dwight| Once Im officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Andy|  I will see you at the inter-view.
Dwight| Yes you will.
Michael| Who is D. Abramson?
Pam| Hes from that company in Pitts...
Jan|  Michael.
Michael| Why... are you here?
Jan| Uh, how are you?
Michael| Im good. How are you, Janet? Its good to see you.
Jan| Im great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Michael| Why privately?
Jan| I just,  I uh... I dont uh... I, I dont, I dont like the way that we left things.
Michael| Okay, sure, fine. Um, why dont you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Jan| Okay.
Michael| Okay.
Michael| Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Pam| What do you want me to do?
Michael| Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Pam| What about Meredith?
Michael| No. Shes an alternate.
Michael| So, how you been?
Jan| Been good.
Michael| Good.
Jan| Good.
Michael| Yeah.
Jan| Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Michael| Weird. Yeah, I didnt get both of your messages.
Pam| So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Karen| Cause of Jan again?
Karen| Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jims and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
Pam| Uh, sure.
Karen| Thanks.
Pam| I really hope you get the job.
Karen| Thanks.
Jan| After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Michael| Hmm.
Jan| To kinda clear my mind.
Michael| Sound good. Sounds fun.
Jan| It was.  Yeah, it was good.  I think Ill just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Michael| Hmm..
Jan| Ive made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Michael| Would you excuse me for a second?
Jan| Ohh...
Michael| Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Phyllis| What are you gonna do?
Michael| I dont know, thats why youre here, help me. Please...
Karen| Do you want to get back together with her?
Michael| No, no. What do I do?
Pam| Just dont get back together with her.
Michael| What if she makes me?
Angela| How can she make you get back together with her?
Michael| She made me do a lot of things I didnt wanna do.
Pam| This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Michael| I wasnt.
Pam| Youre so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Michael| Youre right. Youre absolutely right. Im gonna go in there and tell her that we cant be together.
Pam| Right.
Michael| Wow.
Karen| Do it.
Michael| Im in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Michael|  Okay.  Jan, we need to talk.
Michael| Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Pam| Oh my God.
Pam| No, its fine.  Im sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Meredith| I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Kevin| I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Creed| I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  Thats how I like em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
Jan| So...  there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael| Yeah.
Jan| I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Michael| First got priorities.
Jan| And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Michael| Lets get back together.
Michael| No.  No, no, no, no.  Ill tell you this, it is
Dwight| Okay, everyone, listen up!   Time to begin the interview process!   Andrew Bernard.
Andy| Saving the best for first!
Karen| All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Dwight| No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Oscar| Good luck, you guys!
Dwight| What did I say!?
Pam|  Good luck.
Jim| Thanks.
Pam| Im happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe Im being cliche.  I dont care.  Cause I am what I am.  Thats Popeye.
Dwight| I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Andy| White, because it contains all other colors.
Dwight| Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Andy| You make a chair, but you dont sit on it.
Dwight| What is the capital of Maine?
Andy| The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Dwight| Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Dont wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Andy| Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
Dwight| Youre not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Andy| I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldnt you say?
Andy| I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Dwight|  Time! No, you failed.
Andy| Damn it!
Dwight| This interview is over. Ill let you know.
Karen|  Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Jim| Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Karen| Oh, you know Im gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friends house.
Jim| Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Karen| No, Im sorry I should have been clearer. Its for me.
Jim| Oh...
Karen| Cause Im going to get the job.
Michael|  Remarkable.
Jan| Thanks.
Michael| Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Jan| Oh, okay.
Michael| Very good
Jan| Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Michael| Yes, indeed.
Jan| Good luck with your interview.  Bye.
Michael| So, I guess were getting back together.
Pam| What happened?
Michael| Your advice was good, but Jans was bigger.
Michael| Heres the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didnt connect, I was miserable. Now, Im in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Karen| So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Jim| Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Karen| How often do you come here?
Jim| Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Karen| I think youll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Michael| Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, Ill be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,   I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Dwight|  Whos ready to work?
Jim|  Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. Its in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. Thats when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Karen| That wasnt him.
Karen| So whats going to happen to us when I get this job?
Jim| Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Karen| Well,
Michael|  How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
Karen| Uh, no, were good.  Thanks.
Michael| I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybodys names.  If you need to know somebodys name, just ask me.
Jim|  Whos that?
Michael|
Michael| I am by far the most qualified person theyre interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  Theyre like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Dwight| Michael is gone.
Andy| Hail to the chief!
Dwight| My first order of business make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Andy| My first order of business accept.
Dwight| As if you had a choice.  Duh.  Opportunity of a lifetime.
Andy| Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad.
Michael|  Hey!  Hunter!  Whas up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Hunter| Uh, administrative assistant.
Michael| Jan in yet?
Hunter| I think shes comin in... later.
Michael| Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Hunter| Sure.
Michael| Just say, "I want to squeeze them."  Its code.  Shell know what it means.
Hunter| Okay.
Michael| Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
Dwight| You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Pam| Thank you.
Dwight| I had to make Andy my number two.  Its political, complicated, you wouldnt understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Pam| Really?
Dwight| Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Pam| You will be your own assistant.
Dwight| Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Pam| Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Pam| I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do."
Michael|  Hello, hello!
David| Michael, good to see you!
Michael| Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
David| Oh, great.  Ive been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didnt lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work.  So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Michael| Why dont I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
David| Okay.  And your strengths?
Michael| Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
David|  Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Michael| Thank you.
David| Very good.
Phyllis| Dwight is our new boss.
Oscar| Oh, Michaels not going anywhere.
Pam| Then who do you think will get the job?
Kevin| Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Phyllis| I think its gonna be Michael.
Oscar| Do you really think hes qualified for that job?
Phyllis| No, but he wasnt qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Oscar|  Mm.  Yeah.
Dwight| Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This...  is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Pam|  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Dwight| Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Oscar| So ten
Pam| I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
David| What do you think we could be doing better?
Michael| Ive never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  Were GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"  I dont know, could be good.  Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper.  Its super duper."  I dont know, something like that.
David| Okay!
Michael| Okay.
David| Thanks for comin in, Michael.
Michael| Thank you.
David| It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Michael| It is always a treat when
Dwight| Listen up.  Lets start... from the ground
Karen| So, thats... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
David| Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Karen| Yeah?
David| ...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Karen| Hes a very nice man.  And hes very well suited for the job he has now.
David| This is off the record.
Karen| He would be disaster.
Jan| Hey you!
Michael| Hey.
Jan| How was your interview?
Michael| Pretty good.
Jan| Yeah?
Michael| Could have gone better I guess.
Jan| Oh.  Ill put in a good word for you.
Michael| Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Jan| What?
Michael| Daaah, lets just run away together.  Lets just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  Wed have fun.
Jan| Whats... whats the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Michael| I cant tell you.
Jan| Tell me what?
Jan| You son of a bitch!
David| Jan, this isnt the time, were in an interview---
Jan| Youre
Andy| Its like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Dwight| Its like outerspace without the stars, its so black.
Andy| This is gonna look so awesome!
Dwight| Its so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Andy|  Totally!
Jan|  Bye Hunter.
Hunter| Bye.
Jan| Good luck with your band.
Hunter| Oh, thank---
Jan| Dont let them change you, okay?  So long, .
Michael| So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
David| Actually, Michael, I think were gonna take it in another direction.
Michael| Good, Im glad were on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
David| No, were not giving you the job.
Michael| You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I dont think I could take... my girlfriends job.  Thats not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
David| I do.
Michael| Good.  Very good.  Im glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
David| Yes.
Michael| Good.  Thats all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Karen| Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Jim| Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Karen| Dont!  Shes nuts!
Jim| Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really dont have to stay, if you dont want.
Karen| Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Jim| Okay.
Karen| Just call me when youre done.
Jim| Sure.
Karen| Good luck, Halpert.
Jim| Thank you.
Receptionist|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace.  Sure.
Jan| Oh, God!  I mean, I just dont understand!  Its just
Michael|  Ill be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
Pam| Howd it go?
Michael| No.  No, Pam.  Im baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Michael| Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  "Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in."  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Dwight| To intimidate my subordinates.
Michael| Thats stupid.
Dwight| It was Andys idea.
Michael| You shouldnt have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing Im baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.
Ryan| I dont do that stuff anymore.
Michael| No, its for me, bimbo.  Kids.
Michael| So Im back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
Pam| Did... Karen get the job?
Michael|  Back to work.  Still waitin on that coffee.
Dwight| Pam, hello.
Pam| Dwight, hello.
Dwight| I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity.
Pam| No, I dont know what the future holds, but... Im optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day Ill find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... Im not gay.
David| I dont know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Jim| I should leave.
David| Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  Youre clearly a very bright guy.
Jim| Thanks.
David| Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Jim| Im sorry, wait, so is the question "Howd I get to be so awesome?"  Because, I dont have an answer for you.
David| Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Jim| Yes, absolutely.
David| And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
Jim| Oh, no, absolutely.
David| ...thats a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, hes probably the only person youre not gonna like.   Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Jim|  There you go.
David| How do you think you function here in New York?
Jim|  Whats that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, theres just a  energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.   So thats a... bonus.
David| Youve been in the Scranton branch a long time.  What have you liked most about that place?
Jim|  The friendships.
David| Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Jim|  How are your feet?
Pam| Medium rare.  Thanks.
Jim| The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Pam| I know.
Jim| And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like Ive never really... come back.
Pam| Well, I wish you would.
Pam|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, Ill transfer you.
Pam| I havent heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldnt he?  Hes totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... thats OK.  Were friends.  And Im sure well stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  Its OK.  Im totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally---
Jim| Pam.   Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Pam| Yes.
Jim| All right.  Then... its a date.
Pam|  Im sorry, what was the question?
David|  So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, Im very pleased to be able to offer you this job.   Great!  Im so glad.  Were all very excited youre going to be joining us.  Itll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Ryan|  Im excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Kelly| Who was that?
Ryan|  Nobody.  You and I are done.
Kelly| What?!
