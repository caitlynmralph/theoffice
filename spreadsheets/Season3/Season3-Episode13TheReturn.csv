Dwight| I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And its very exciting.
Dwight| For your convenience, Ive broken it down into three parts professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
Dwight| I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Dwight| How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Dwight| There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
Dwight|  I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, its fine for the time being. Oops. Breaks over.
Andy|  Big Turkey.
Jim| Is that you singing?
Andy| All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
Jim| Nice job.
Andy| Thank you muchly.
Jim| You gonna answer it?
Andy| I called it myself. I just thought youd get a kick out of the new ring.
Jim| Yikes.
Andy| Side note. Id just like to say Im thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Jim| Thank you.
Andy| I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though youre younger and have less experience.  So heres to the future... Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna...
Jim| I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Michael| Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Andy| The cost of doing business.
Michael| Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
Andy| Was the top salesman...
Michael| I said was.
Andy|  Addition by subtraction.
Michael| What does that even mean? That is impossible.
Andy| Mmmm. Yeah youre right.
Michael| But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybodys spirits.
Oscar| Hey, everyone.
Kevin| Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
Oscar| Oh, thats very funny.
Kevin| Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Oscar|  Hi, Angela.
Angela| Oscar.
Andy| Hey, boss.
Michael| Hey, whats up.
Andy| Noooothin. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
Michael| Yep.
Andy| Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
Michael| I dont know. Maybe.
Andy| Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going?
Michael| Bathroom.
Andy| Oh, well, Im going to the kitchen, Ill walk with you.
Andy|  Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin a lot of face time with the boss.
Angela| Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Oscar| The one of all women?
Angela| Yeah.
Oscar| Because Im gay?
Angela| No. No. Certain events have transpired. And Ive thought about certain things. And Im sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Oscar| OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. Ill join. Id love to. Thats -- thank you.
Angela| Thank you.
Kevin| Can I join too?
Angela| Never.
Staples Guy| You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
Dwight|  Childs play. Give me something hard to sell.
Michael| Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Pam| Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Michael| Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Pam| Oh, that wasnt the night crew. That was Dwight.
Michael| Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Andy| Feel ya, dawg.
Michael| Yeah, do you?
Andy| Absolutely.
Michael| What did I say?
Andy| You said...
Michael| Huh.
Andy| Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it.
Michael| Oh, no.
Andy| Oh, no.
MIchael| Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... theres something about him that creeps me out. I cant really explain it. Hes always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I dont understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
Oscar| I really have no preference. We dont even have to have a party.
Michael| No, hey, hey. Dont be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
Oscar| Michael --
Michael| No, no, no. I mean, not because youre gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscars Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
Oscar| Why dont you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Michael| Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, lets get him one.
Dwight| Need any help?
Lady| Oh, no, thank you. Im just looking.
Dwight| Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Lady| Okay.
Andy| I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here.  Whizzzzz.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Jim| Hey.
Karen| Hey.
Jim| So Andy is in rare form today.
Karen| Yeah, you should not encourage him.
Jim| Encourage him? Im the victim, okay? Hes fishing for me. Weve got to do something.
Karen| Look, Ive got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, Im sorry. I cant.
Jim| Fine. Party pooper.
Michael| Whos that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Andy| 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
Jim| Hey, Ryan?
Ryan| What?
Jim| You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
Ryan| Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Jim| I liked you better when you were the temp.
Ryan| Yeah, me too.
Michael| Hey guys. Hows the workload on all of Dwights old accounts? Handling it okay?
Phyllis| Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Michael| Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
Stanley| Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
Michael| Really?
Stanley| No.
Michael| Dont - dont do that. Thats not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Phyllis| No. Sorry.
Phyllis| Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Paris| Really comin down out there. Commutes gonna be hell.
Dwight| I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Paris| So um, where were you workin before this?
Dwight| Dunder-Mifflin.
Paris| What kind of company is that?
Dwight|  Paper company. Theyre only one of Staples top competitors in the area.
Paris| I never heard of em.
Dwight| Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Paris| You gonna be like that, huh?
Paris| I dont like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. Thats all I got to say on the matter.
Andy|  In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
Jim| Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Pam| Oh, Im kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
Jim| Okay, good. Stay right here.
Andy|  Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
Jim|  Are there any messages?
Pam| Nope.
Jim| So weird.
Pam|  Hmm.
Michael| Nice to have Oscar back.
Angela| Yeah.
Andy| Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Jim| No.
Andy| Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Pam| Angela?
Angela| Oh.
Pam| Is everything okay?
Angela| No.
Andy| Whats going on?
Jim| What are you talking about?
Andy| Where is my FREAKING phone?!
Jim| You know what?  Maybe its in the ceiling.
Andy| Maybe youre in the ceiling!
Jim| Okay.
Andy|  I dont trust you, Phyllis!
Angela| I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Michael| Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Angela| Yes.
Michael| Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Angela| None of them. Especially not Andy.
Michael| Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
Andy| Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Michael| Um.
Andy| Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and well hit the tiz-own.
Michael| No. I dont want to do any of that.
Andy| Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
Michael| No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. Youre going to drive me crazy.
Andy| Fine. Ill just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And Im also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think its funny to steal someones personal property and hide it from them. Heres a little newsflash! Its not funny! In fact, its pretty freakin unfunny!  Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
Pam| Yeah.
Andy| Sure? Okay.
Dwight|  Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. Its your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Michael| Hey.
Dwight| Hey.
Michael| Whats up?
Dwight| Same old.
Michael| Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Dwight| Oh my God, she told you?
Michael| Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
Dwight| Accepted.
Michael| Hows this place treating you?
Dwight|  The boss isnt funny.
Michael| Oh, well.
Dwight| I dont get to wear my ties.
Michael| No. Im sure.
Dwight| So?
Michael| So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
Dwight| I dont want to do your laundry anymore.
Michael| We can talk about that.  All right.
Jim|  Oh my God, thats half-inch drywall.
Pam| I think we broke his brain.
Jim|  "Its not freakin funny!"
Angela| Are you enjoying your fiesta?
Oscar| Actually, yeah. I didnt think I would, but turns out --  its great.
Michael| Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Everybody| Yay.
Angela| Welcome back.
Dwight| Thank you.
Michael| Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. Youre gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
Dwight| You did this for me?
Michael| Guilty.
Creed| Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
Meredith| Gertys.
Creed| Which aisle?
Meredith| I dont remember.
Creed| Well, draw me a map, mama.
Michael| Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Pam| No, I will not.
Michael| So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Oscar| It reminds me a lot of the Three Amigos with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Michael| Wow. Thank you. Wow, thats-- thanks so much.
Jim| Hey.
Karen|  Do you still have feelings for her?
Jim|  Yes.
Michael| And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?
Dwight| Oh, man.  No, no, no. I dont need it. Get out!
Michael| It takes a big man to admit his mistake and thats what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I dont want somebody sucking up to me because they think Im going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
Andy| So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, dont worry about old Andy Bernard. Ill be back. Just like Rambo, so.
Marcy| Oh, hi. You must be Andy.
Andy| Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
Marcy| Thats right, its so good to meet you.
Andy| Its so good to meet you!
Marcy| Thanks.  Well, you ready to have some fun?
Andy| Yeah.
