Dwight| Merry Christmas!
Pam| Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Dwight| Dont worry, shes dead. Oh wait. Hes dead.
Pam| Dwight, what uh...
Dwight| I accidentally ran over it. Its a Christmas miracle!
Pam| Well, get it out of here.
Dwight| Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Jim| Merry Christmas Dwight.
Dwight| Jim.
Jim| Wow. What have we got here?
Dwight| What does it look like?
Jim| Dead goose.
Dwight| And circle gets the square.
Jim| All right.
Dwight|  So can you watch this? Im gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
Toby| Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
Dwight| No, Toby, this is different. Hes already dead.
Dwight| Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didnt want to see it killed.
Dwight| He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
Jim| Wow. Win-Win.
Dwight| Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
Phyllis| I like goose. If its already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Creed| Thats crazy. Its crazy.
Toby| Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
Dwight| Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Toby| Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
Dwight| Its Christmas Toby.
Toby| Its a dead animal in an office. You cant...
Dwight| Toby...
Toby| Im sorry.
Dwight|  Please? Please?
Toby| Clean it in your car.
Pam| I would like it off my desk.
Dwight| Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
Michael|  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
Pam| Can I help you, Michael?
Michael| Im looking for the toy drive box.
Pam| Its behind you.
Michael| OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope itll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
Jim| Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Michael| Umm... I dont know? Average kind?
Kevin| The tires look pretty worn.
Michael| Well, that is probably from the test drive.
Jim| But the paints chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Michael| No.
Andy| Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
Michael| Oh, thanks.
Pam| Michael?
Michael| Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didnt have to do that.
Pam|  I didnt, its from corporate.
Michael| OK. Did everybody get one of these?
Pam| Yup.
Michael| Terrific. Good.
Michael| This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  Ive got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, were leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
Jim|  Oh, I think youre supposed to put a toy
in| the box, Creed.
Creed| And a happy holiday to you.
Jim|   Carol.
Carol| Hi, is Michael around here?
Michael| There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  Youre about five hours early to the party. Youre such a blonde.
Carol| Michael.
Michael| Hey, everybody. I dont know who you havent met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show em, show em the other side.
Carol|  What?
Michael| Turn around, turn around. Come on.
Carol| Get outta here.
Michael| No, you get outta here.
Andy| Michael
Michael| Yes.
Andy| If I may say. Shes even prettier that you described her.
Dwight|  Oh, ouch. Michael, I dont think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Michael| Thank you.
Carol| I really need a moment alone with you.
Michael| Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
Carol| What is this?
Michael| That is my Christmas card. Its a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
Carol| No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Michael| I know.
Carol| I went on a ski trip.
Michael| Right.
Carol| Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Michael| Yes, but what you didnt realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
Carol| Michael.
Michael| And next to your kids. What?
Carol| This is so weird.
Michael| I dont understand?
Jim| Its a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michaels a bold guy.  Is bold the right word?
Carol| I think youre a really sweet guy.
Michael| OK
Carol| But, um, I dont know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I dont think things are going to work out with us.
Michael| No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, youre not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaicas largest fresh water pool.
Carol| What are you talking about?
Michael| I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
Carol| Oh, no. Michael.
Michael| And its all inclusive.
Carol| Michael...
Michael| Yes.
Carol| Im sorry.
Michael| No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
Carol| I know.
Pam| Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, Ill just tell you.
Jim| What?
Pam| For the past few months Ive been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
Jim| Are you serious?
Pam| Theyre considering him for a top secret mission. Theres his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised hed never ever tell.
Jim|  Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Pam| So... heres the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didnt wrap it.
Jim|  You know what? Uh, I really dont think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Pam| Oh.
Jim| No, because of the promotion.
Pam| Oh yeah.
Jim| It just feels a little bit, like...
Pam| No, I get it, of course. OK.
Jim| I feel like theres a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Michael| Id like everybodys attention. Christmas is canceled.
Stanley| You cant cancel a holiday.
Michael| Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Years.
Stanley| What does that mean?
Michael| Jim, take New Years away from Stanley.
Pam| Michael, whats going on?
Michael| Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just dont think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
Jim| Will they still air Rudolph?
Kevin| Thats not fair.
Dwight|  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Michael| Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
Phyllis| But we invited guests.
Michael| Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
Michael| Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
Pam| I know.
Michael| It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
Pam| OK, well, why are you laying like that?
Michael|  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Pam| Like what?
Michael| Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
Pam| Well.. um I, I dont...
Michael| And not that you didnt want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what Im referring to?
Pam| I dont need to know.
Dwight| Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears were one bathrobe short.
Michael| Take it from Toby.
Dwight|  Copy.
Michael| Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
Pam| No, thank you.
Michael| Its all...  OK.
Toby| Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe-  Why?
Angela| Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
Phyllis| I thought you said green was whorish.
Angela| No, orange is whorish.
Karen| Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... .
Angela| It would never work here.
Karen| Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
Angela| No.
Karen| A Christmas drinking game ...
Meredith| Yes.
Angela| God help you.
Karen| What?
Angela| These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.
Karen| Youre kidding.
Angela| You tried this out, and its clearly not for you. Its time to go. Come on.  Please.  Thank you. OK, thank you very much.
Michael| What are you doing?
Dwight|  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Andy| Hey, whats the haps?
Michael| Carol?
Dwight| Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. Its riddled with Carols name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
Dwight| Why dont you just buy the whole song?
Michael| I dont have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
Dwight| Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldnt that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Michael|  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
Michael| This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
Pam| I feel like Ive been kinda cold to Karen and theres no real reason for it. I mean its not like shes ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldnt be cold to her.
Pam| Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Karen| Yeah, right? Im so glad you said that. Because, I dont know how those meetings usually go.
Pam| Um, usually like that.
Karen| Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Pam| I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
Karen| Right.
Pam| Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
Karen| Oh cool, yeah.
Pam| That could really be fun.
Karen|  Oh, thank you.
Pam| You guys do a raffle?
Karen| Yeah, we do a raffle...
Toby| Hey Kev.
Kevin| Hey.
Angela| This shouldve been up yesterday.
Phyllis| Itll be all right.
Angela|  What is that?  The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" Theres no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties."
Pam| There is now. We just started it.
Angela| Well, you just cant start a committee. You have to have funding.
Karen| Whats your funding?
Angela| Two hundred dollars.
Pam| Whats ours again?
Karen| Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
Pam| Oh right.
Kelly|  Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
Angela| No, that is not a party. Theres only one party and its hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three oclock.
Kevin| Then why are there two flyers?
Karen| Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. Theres a party that starts at three.
Kevin| Right.
Karen| And then theres a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Pam| Right, and if youre interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.
Kevin| I didnt see where it was.
Jim| Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And thats what you want, right?
Karen| I think thats a really good option...
Dwight| Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Pam| You cant do that.
Dwight| As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Andy| Umm... Im number three.
Dwight| Youre number four.
Andy| Yeah, but Im number three.
Dwight| Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
Jim| OK, I think I can help here.
Dwight| Ok, good
Jim| As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Dwight| OK, this is stupid.
Jim| Could you please keep it down?  Im in session. Ive determined that this committee is valid.
Dwight| No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Jim| Permission denied.
Dwight| Damn it!
Andy| Hey. I cant concentrate when I know youre in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  Cmon, my treat.
Michael| All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Andy| Thats my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
Michael| Hooters?
Andy| No. Benihana. Much classier. But dont worry, the babes are totally hot, too.
Michael| Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. Cmon, were going to Asian Hooters.
Ryan| Ah man, I cant.
Michael| Why not?
Ryan| Im not feeling so well. Ive got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.
Michael| Ok, feel better.
Ryan| Thanks.
Michael| Cmon Jim, lets go.
Jim| OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Ryan| Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
Michael| Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly shes not yo ho no mo.
Andy| So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today."  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table.
Dwight| Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, Im going to need take this chair.
Michael| Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. Theyre on a date. They look very happy.
Andy| So she looks at me right, and she goes, "Im sorry, dont I even know you?" After a year, a
year| of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?
Jim| Yes.
Dwight| I cant... I cant here what youre saying.
Michael| Carol used to drink lattes.
Dwight|  Whatre you talking about?
Michael| She would get this little foam mustache...
Dwight|  Carol had a mustache?
Michael| And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And shed say, thats not funny.
Dwight|  What are you guys talking about?
Michael| She totally got me. She understood that we didnt have to laugh to enjoy ---
Dwight| Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
Dwight| It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if Im here for Michael?
Michael| Im already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I cant, OK, Im gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
Andy| No.
Dwight| Who are you calling?
Michael| Im just gonna call her.
Andy| Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help.
Waitress| What can I get for ya?
Andy| I think well start with a round of noga-sakes.
Andy| One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places wont make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
Phyllis| You should, you should put out salt for the rims
Pam| Thats a great idea.
Angela| Phyllis?
Phyllis| I was just getting a snack.
Pam| You can have your snack in here.
Angela| Pam, dont tell her what to do! Phyllis.
Phyllis| OK.
Kevin| I think Ill go to Angelas party, because thats the party I know.
Ryan| I miss the days when there was only one party I didnt want to go to.
Roy| So I only use three?
Pam| If youre using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, youre doing it wrong.
Roy| OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
Pam| Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
Roy| OK. Are you sure I cant use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
Pam| Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
Roy|  Hey. All right, Ill see you guys later.
Pam| Bye.
Karen| Hes cute. You should date him.
Pam| Oh, yeah... Maybe.
Dwight| Looks like youve got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Chef| No, its Usuba.
Dwight| Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Chef| Actually, the Usubas the better knife when youre working with this quantity.
Dwight| Nah, I dont know... Still think Nakiris better.
Woman at bar| I think hed know.
Michael| Nothing hes doing is cheering me up.
Andy| Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldnt do that to him, would you?
Cindy| I dont know.
Michael| Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
Andy| You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell ya?
Michael| Youre right. Thats good.
Pam| Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Angela| I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!
Angela|  I need to know if I can start the party?
Dwight| Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
Andy| This drink...
Michael| I dont know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Angela| Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Dwight|  Start the party.
Angela|  Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now
Pam| Our party is also starting now
Karen| Yup.
Karen|  All right Stanley. Woo.
Pam| Good choice.
Angela| Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Hannah| Why would I be disappointed?
Angela| I said you wouldnt be disappointed.
Angela| Meredith, if you dont come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Meredith| Is that a threat?
Angela| No, its an invitation.
Pam| We have vodka!
Karen| Lots of it!
Kevin| I hear Angelas party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela  Hmmm...
Angela| Brownies. Cupcakes.
Kevin| Dont push it.
Karen| Are we taking this too far? You know what, I dont think were taking this far enough.  What?
Pam| I got goose bumps.
Angela| I dont back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we havent talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I dont even remember. So... yeah. Im pretty good.
Michael| Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak.
Man| Excuse me.
Michael| Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.
Jim| No, its not.
Andy| Cindy, Cindy.
Michael| I dont think... I love it!
Andy| I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  Cmon, do it for Michael. Hes had a really long day.
Michael|  I dont know what hes doing.
Andy| This is great.
Dwight| Jim! Jim! What... Whats happening?
Jim| Oh,  shes asleep.
Dwight| Oh... Narcolepsy.
Jim| Probably.
Andy| Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Cindy| I... dont know, it has four bed rooms and a loft...
Dwight| Oh my gosh, now shes up.
Jim| And shes trying to correctly butcher a goose, but shes having trouble coming up with it.
Dwight| Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, theres going to be a good amount of blood.  Dont let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
Jim| Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, its pretty much the same thing.
Kelly| What dya think?
Stanley| Fruity and delicious.
Kelly| See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Meredith| No thanks. Theyre too sweet.
Karen| Hey, so whats the status.
Ryan| Looks like they forgot the power cord.
Pam| What?
Karen| Oh, youre kidding me?
Ryan| No.
Karen| Oh, you guys, guys, um... Im sorry, but theres a problem with the karaoke machine.
Kelly| Well that blows.
Darryl| Hang on little ladies. You dont need this thing, Ill go grab my synthesizer.
Everybody| Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Phyllis| Hi.
Darryl| Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your...  meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. Were having a party.
Phyllis| Oh, ok.
Darryl| All right. Se you later...
Hannah|  These nuts are really hard to crack.
Angela| Try harder then.  Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyones had some.
Kevin| Youve got to be kidding!
Angela| Youve got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Phyllis| Cold, huh?
Ryan| Huh?
Phyllis| Maybe thatll help. Is it cold in there?
Andy|  They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
Michael| You know what we should do?
Andy| What?
Michael| We should invite them to the Christmas party.
Andy| Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
Michael| Oh, you are such mench my friend.
Michael| OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
Jim| Im sure theyll want to meet her, too.
Michael| The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Second Cindy| That rocks.
Michael| Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, its yours.
Second Cindy| Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.
Michael| Oh.  Thats what she said.
Michael| Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
Andy| My new girlfriend.
Angela| Wheres Dwight?
Second Cindy| Is he the hot one or the giant baby?
Michael|  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Phyllis|  Theres another party in the break room.
Michael| Oh, party in the break room! Lets go, lets go! Thank God! Lets go to the break room.
Angela| Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think youre going with that?
Second Cindy| I thought I could have it.
Angela| You cant have it  I dont walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Michael| Shhh... Shut it! Cmon! Party.
Dwight| Hey! Its Angela!  Hey!
Michael| Were going to ...
Kevin|  I want you to know. That Im happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Michael| I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree?
Other waitress| Do I agree about what?
Michael| Do you agree about what?  Wow. Youre  lucky youre so darn cute.
Other waitress| Whatre you talking about?
Michael| Whatre you talking about?
Kevin|  And Im here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. Its not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
Jim| All right
Angela| Did you have fun at Benihanas?
Dwight| No. It was awful. I couldnt hear anything.
Angela| Ive had the worse day here
Karen|  Dwight, you won the raffle!
Dwight| No... way! Yeah!
Karen| Open it! Open it ! Open it!
Dwight| Oh.
Karen| Do you like it?
Dwight| Walkie-talkies.
Pam| Can I talk to you a second?
Dwight| Yes!
Karen| Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. Were gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Pam|  In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Karen| Angela, weve been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping youd consider merging into two parties.
Angela| Im not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Pam| Yeah, but we dont have a power cord.
Angela| Oh, I may have seen it somewhere.  Is it this one?
Pam| Mmm. Hmm.
Karen| Yeah, thanks.
Pam| Well go tell everyone.
Karen| OK.
Andy and Michael|  And if you want love, well make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland.  Your body is a wonderland.
Andy| Your hands.
Both| Your body is a wonderland.
Andy| Ill use my hands on it.
Both| Something bout the way your hair falls in your face...
Kelly|  Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Michael| When you know, you just know.
Kevin| Right.
Michael| Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Roy| Which one is she?
Michael| Its... its one of those two.
Roy| You dont know?
Kevin| Dude, you should know.
Michael| Yeah... well, its been hard, theyre wearing the exact same uniform. And Ive been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
Michael| I honestly dont see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesnt love his wife just because hes not sure what she looks like?
Michael| Hey. Wheres my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I dont know where she is. Cause Im drunk, I cant even find her.
Second Cindy| You know where I am.
Michael| Haha, I do! I just havent hugged you in awhile
Second Cindy| Oh.
Michael| Oh, good. That felt good. Lets go. Party.
Creed|  Spinnin n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet dont touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, Im crazy about ya...
Dwight|  Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
Angela|  Copy, Possum. Whats your twenty?
Karen| No way.
Jim| What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
Karen| And now we get to remember it forever.
Jim| Thank you.
Karen| Thank you.
Second Cindy| Hey.
Michael| Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
Second Cindy| Hey. This party blows, so were gonna leave.
Michael| No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
Second Cindy| Cool...
Michael| Where do you wanna go?
Second Cindy| I... Were just gonna take off.
Michael| I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
Second Cindy| No... I have school.
Michael| You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
Second Cindy| Merry Christmas.
Dwight|  Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
Michael| That waitress was the one.
Jim| No. She wasnt.
Michael| How can you be sure?
Jim| Well, for starters, Ive known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago.
Michael| Dont make fun... Youre making fun of me.
Jim| Sorry.
Michael| I guess, I didnt know her very well. I marked her arm.
Jim| You what?
Michael| I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I dont... I know, I know. I cant believe I gave her my bike!
Jim| Yeah.
Michael| Oh, why do I feel like crap?
Jim| You just had a rebound.
Michael| I had rebound? Yeah.
Jim| Yeah. Which, dont get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when its over, youre left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Michael| I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didnt score and Im not sure whos actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesnt matter. Its all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
Angela|  Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. Thats fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
Michael|  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. Theres this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you wont be disappointed. Umm, Its all-inclusive...
Angela|  ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum
Oscar| Too soon.
Angela|  I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
Dwight|  pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Dwight| Bye Pam.
Pam| Night.
Jim|  Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Pam| We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier.
Jim| Oh no, that would be great.
Pam| It costs seventy five dollars.
Jim| Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Pam| Ohh...
Dwight|  What the?  "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?
