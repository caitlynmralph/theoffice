Michael| Ughh... Blech.
Dwight| OK, where does it hurt?
Michael| Just... all over. I dont want to do anything... Im dying...
Dwight| No, thats not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Michael| Right there.
Dwight|  "Abdomen. Menses."
Michael| Maybe.
Dwight| "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
Michael| Not it. I dont have eggs.
Pam| About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Dwight| Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Michael| Thats possible.
Pam| Michael?
Michael| Uh-huh?
Pam| David Wallace is on line one.
Michael| The CFO? Ohh...
Michael| OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
Michael| To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
David|  Michael, I am calling---
Michael| And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
David| Jan is out of town right now.
Michael| Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jans heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
David| Michael?
Michael| ...you just gots to get your freak on.
David| Michael?
Michael| Yeah.
David| Michael?
Michael| Hmmm.
David| I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Michael| Really?
David| Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Michael| Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
David| Thats not necessary.
Michael| May God guide you in your quest.
David| Yes.
Michael| OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Meredith| Oh Im excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So Im wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
not| wearing anything underneath] Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse.
Michael| Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Oscar| I dont wear a Speedo, Michael.
Michael| Well, you cant swim in leather pants.  Im just yankin your chain.  Not literally.
Toby| Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Michael| Oh, you know what? Uh, youre not going.
Toby| Its Beach Day...
Michael| Yeah, I know. Im sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
Michael| I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then itll suck.
Toby| Hey, want my sun screen?
Pam| Oh, great. I forgot mine and Im wearing a two piece.
Toby| Uh-huh.
Pam| Thanks Toby.
Michael| Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
Pam| I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Michael| We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about peoples character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
Michael| What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. Its like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
Pam| You want me to write down peoples indefinable qualities?
Michael| I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
Pam| I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldnt I have the most boring job on beach day?
Michael| This way to the partay bus.
Kevin| I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. Thats all Ive ever wanted.
Kevin|   And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If youre gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right."  You got to know when to hold em, know when to fold em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when youre sittin at the table. Therell be time enough for countin when the dealins done.
Michael| Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
Stanley| Oh, sweet mother of God.
Michael| If you dont like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Stanley| Excuse me?
Michael| Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Dwight| Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasnt just a trip to the beach.
Michael| Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasms turning people off.
Dwight| I hope there will be management parables.
Michael| Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Pam| Like what?
Michael| Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just dont...
Pam| Well... no, I dont... exactly... what?
Michael| Well write it down before you forget it. Thats... Youve just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I cant stay mad at you.
Michael| Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!
Angela| Everyone put on sunscreen.
Michael| Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. Americas eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Oscar| What?
Michael| Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Michael| Jim Halpert. Pros smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
Dwight| I choose Michael!
Michael| Im not playing.
Dwight| OK, temp.
Michael| Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
Michael| We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Dwight| We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim| Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight| Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Jim| I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Dwight| He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldnt do that.
Jim|  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Dwight| OK, seriously. You really shouldnt be saying that.
Michael| Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Stanley| I dont care what you call my team.
Michael| Then I will name your team the Red team.
Stanley| No , the blue team.
Michael| I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Andy| We will be team U.S.A.
Michael| Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Michael| Andy Bernard. Pros Hes classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons I dont really trust him.
Michael| It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Stanley| Theres already a twist, youre carrying an egg on a spoon.
Michael| Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
Oscar| Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh...
Stanley| Thank you so much.
Andy| Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.
Kelly| I dont want to hit the big rock!
Andy| Dont worry. Youre not...
Kelly| I know Im near the big rock. I just know it.
Andy| No where near the big rock.
Kelly|  I just dont want to get hit by it...
Andy| Whatre you doing? No! See, now were disqualified.
Andy| I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!
Jim|  Woah, stop, stop, stop. Theres a hole. Step over the hole.
Karen| Hole?
Jim| Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Dwight|  Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Ryan| Can you just stop this right now, or Im not gonna do this anymore.
Dwight| What are you saying?
Ryan| You have to stop yelling at me or Im not gonna do the egg race.
Dwight| OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
Ryan| Thats what being a good captain is about. Its about listening to the members of your team.
Dwight| I am trying to bring team spirit.
Jim|  Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes!
Karen|  Oh my God! You ass!
Pam| Theres nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.
Michael|  Pam...youre missing things.
Dwight|  Lets go! Lets go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard!  What the? Damn it temp!
Andy|  Great job everyone, that was fantastic.
Michael| Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Pam| Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Michael| Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so its not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest Im going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Pam| Whens the contest?
Michael| Like umm... ten minutes?
Pam| How am I supposed to... get...
Michael| Thanks a bunch.
Michael| A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Michael| OK, whos hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Kelly| Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael| No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Oscar| Turkey is a healthy meat.
Dwight| Its very good for you.
Michael| Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Lets just... OK, its very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
Phyllis| Is there any mustard?
Michael| No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so itll slide down your gullet more easily.
Michael| Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Meredith|  What is it?
Michael| I cant say.
Jim| You cant say, or you cant pronounce it?
Michael| The winner gets a regional managers salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
Kelly| Can we just take those first two things?
Michael| The winner of today gets my job. Ok? Im interviewing for a job at corporate. And theyre only interviewing a handful of people and Im the most qualified and Ill probably get it. Alright?
Dwight| Youre leaving?
Michael| I didnt want to tell anyway. I didnt want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I dont know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Andy|  I am so hungry!
Stanley| Do you expect me to believe that youre truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Michael|  Word.  There we go. Lets see it.
Stanley| I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Michael| Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Kelly| Team U.S.A.!
Andy| One came up.
Michael| 13 hot dogs, everybody!
Dwight| Damn it!
Creed|  Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
Dwight| Sabotage.
Angela| What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Dwight| No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
Angela| I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Dwight| If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Michael| Its very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Stanley| Uh, we dont have any safety mittens
Michael| Probably left them in the trunk of my car. Its alright.  Its alright. Here we go.
Karen| Get em big boy!
Michael| Aaaaaand, go!
Karen| Cmon, Jim!
Stanley|
Jim| What are you doing?
Michael| Nice, Stanley!
Stanley|  Sorry about that. Its all about taking points away from Dwight.
Jim| Yeah. No. Good.
Jim| Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a mans eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Oscar| If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. Im kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. Well see.
Dwight|  Gaaaaa....
Michael| One. Two. Three.
Dwight| Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Michael| Excellent!
Dwight| Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Andy| I didnt win. But the only reason I didnt win is because I recently learned that its better to work thing out with words.
Dwight| Thats not why you lost.
Andy| Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Dwight| Yeah, right.
Andy| Yeah, right, cmon! Cmon!
Dwight|  Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Andy|  Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
Angela| What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Andy| Go tell them Im floating away, obviously!
Angela| I dont understand what you want from me.
Andy| Angela, its pretty simple! Look at what Im doing and go tell somebody about it!
Angela| Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Andy| Angela!
Michael| I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... whos ahead in points?
Pam| I think theyre even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I dont really know how to compare those units.
Michael| Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Pam| I really doubt it, Michael.
Michael| Please just check.
Jim|  Great. Yeah, Ill see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Karen| Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Jim| In well?
Karen| As well.
Jim| How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Karen| Yes. uh, huh.
Jim| Wait a minute.
Karen| That would be fine.
Jim| If this job is in a well, I dont want it.
Karen|  Cut it out!
Jim| I dont!
Michael| What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Stanley| How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I cant do this anymore! Im goin to sit in the bus.
Michael| Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Michael| Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Kevin| Are you going to try it?
Angela| Im not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Kevin| Angela, it is a million degrees.
Pam| Im gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. Thats the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Michael| No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pam| Id like to try it.
Michael| Pointless.
Pam| But Im not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Michael| Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, youre up.
Jim| Nope.
Michael| Ji.. why not? Cmon.
Jim| Oh, cause I dont want my feet to get burned.
Michael| You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Jim| Thats harsh.
Michael| Whos next? Andy? Wheres Andy? Andy is never here today.
Andy|  Hello?  Whos there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Kevin| Why dont you go Michael?
Michael| Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Jim| And that is not the same at all. If youre going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Michael| Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
Pam| Do you want us to count to three?
Michael| Yes. Count to three, please.
Group| Three. Two. One.
Michael| Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Group| One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
Michael| Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Creed| On the go thats after three.
Michael| Okay.
Group| One, two, three, go!
Dwight| No! Its okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael| Dont, dont.
Dwight|  I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Group| Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.
Dwight|  GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Michael| Im not going to give it to you.
Dwight|  Aaagh, aaagh!
Group|
Pam| Michael, do something!
Dwight| Aggggh, that stings!
Michael| Being the boss is also about image.  Ive never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I dont see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire."
Angela| Or Mrs. "Outside Hire."
Michael| Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I dont want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Kelly| Whos Bob Hope?
Michael| God! Hes a comedian.
Kelly| Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Michael| Whos Amanda Bynes?
Kelly| Shes from "What a Girl Wants."
Michael| Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Jim| Hey, I know what youre looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really dont think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael| You are being too modest.
Jim| Michael, on Thursday Im going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Michael| Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
Dwight| The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"
Pam|  Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Dwight|  I mean truly repulsive acts.
Michael| That is a very, very funny story.
Pam|  Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldnt even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didnt any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. Its like sometimes some of you act like I dont even exist.   Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now were not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldnt have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didnt care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now youre with someone else. And thats... fine. Its... whatever. Thats not what... Im not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that Im just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. Its a good day.
Michael| Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
Group| Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  Theyre a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, theyre a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da.  When youre with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, well have a gay old time!
Michael| WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
Andy| Nice!
