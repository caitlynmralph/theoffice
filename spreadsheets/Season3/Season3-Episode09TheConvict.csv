Pam| Ohhhh! Shes absolutely adorable!
Hannah| He.
Pam| ...Oh, sorry. Hes--hes dressed all in pink.
Hannah| Thats his favorite color.
Pam| ...Oh. Thats... fun for him.
Stanley| Fantastic. 
Michael| Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute. 
Hannah| Thank youuu.
Michael| Ohh. May I?
Hannah| Uh, sure!
Michael|  Hey, look at me, Im a baby! Im one of those babies from "Look Whos Talking." What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! Whats a stapler!? I dont even know, Im a baby! Hey, Mom, Im thirsty! Im thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Karen| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Karen| ...Almost done?
Jim| Just about... yup. Now. 
Jim| Yes. I have started to see Karen. Its very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Michael| Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I dont know.
Angela| Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Jan|  Mmhmm.
Angela| Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. 
Jan| We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
Michael| I didnt hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... Im just kidding.
Jan| When did the check come?
Angela| Last week. 
Jan| Okay, thats when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
Angela| One of the Stamford people is a criminal? 
Michael| Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Angela| Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Jan| Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, Im not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Pam|  Who is it?
Michael| Hannah?
Kevin| Hmm.
Angela| Hmm.
Kevin| Andy.
Angela| Andy?
Kevin| Hmm. Martin? 
Michael| Kuhhhh... you are such a racist. 
Kevin| Wait, why am I a racist?
Michael| Because you think hes black.
Kevin| He is black... right? And... 
Michael| Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
Jan| ...Okay its someone named Martin Nash.
Kevin| Yeah!
Jan| Michael?
Michael| Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guys lake.
Kevin| I wonder what he did. 
Michael| In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
Pam| Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Michael| Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Kevin| Cool.
Pam| Okay. Angela?
Angela| Sure. Lets protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Michael| Good. All right. 
Jim|  Jim Halpert.
Andy|  I am so horny.
Jim| ...Okay I cant... help you... with that.
Andy| Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
Jim| She is dating Ryan, I think.
Andy| Oh, and I care why?
Jim| Shes... high-maintenance.
Andy| Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. Cmon, trust me on that.
Jim| Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Andy| Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Jim| ...Absolutely you should.
Andy| Jackpot.
Michael| Just... try to be cool.
Dwight| I am cool.
Michael| Okay, are you cool, really?
Dwight| Im cool, Im cool, Im so cool. Tell me what is going on. 
Michael| Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
Dwight| I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Andy| All... righty, lets get started. What is she into?
Jim| I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... 
Jim| Frisbee-based competitions... 
Andy| Are you kidding?
Jim| She... 
Andy| I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
Jim| Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Michael| Hey Martin, hows it going?
Martin| Good. Getting settled, you know?
Michael| Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesnt is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
Pam| My dad.
Michael| ...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
Jim| Jonas Salk.
Michael| Who?
Jim| Justin Timberlake?
Michael| Oh. Please. Colin Powell. 
Karen| Hey I got one.
Michael| Yup.
Karen| Jesus.
Michael| Apollo Creed.
Michael| Close your eyes. Picture a convict. Whats he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... yo, thats shizzle. Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. 
Martin| So... you all wanna know what I was in for?
Michael| No. Thats not cool. You dont have to tell them. 
Martin| Um, I really dont mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. 
Michael|  That is awesome.
Kevin| I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Pam| What was prison like?
Martin| Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.
Kevin| You got outdoors time?
Martin| Two hours, every day. Sometimes wed play pickup football games... 
Kevin| Michael, why dont we get outdoors time? 
Pam| Yeah, some days I never go outside.
Michael| Well, we are running a business, so.
Meredith| What was your cell like?
Martin| Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michaels office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our times our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.
Pam| They have art classes?
Martin| Yeap. Yeah.
Ryan| They have business classes there?
Martin| They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. 
Pam| Kinda sounds like... prisons... better than Dunder-Mifflin. 
Michael| Ah. Well. Thats not true.
Kevin| I would so rather be in prison. 
Ryan| Prison sounds great.
Michael| No you would not. 
Michael| This place is not prison. Its... way better than prison.
Creed|  Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
Karen| You cant give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. 
Creed| Oh, its okay. Ive got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Andy| Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, youre cute. There is no gettin around it. So... I dont know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? 
Pam| Wow... I--
Andy| Shh. Think about it. Ill hit you back. 
Pam| Wow. That was... wow. 
Michael| Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So lets go! 
Pam| Michael, its freezing out.
Phyllis| I cant feel my toes. 
Michael| Why dont we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? 
Jim| What is that, like... five pounds?
Michael| Its uh... two and a half. Im not going for bulk, Im going for tone. 
Stanley| Im going back inside.
Michael| Yeah, its... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, youve got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time. 
Michael| Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
Martin| Yeah, in the rec room. 
Michael| Ah. A ten inch black and white?
Martin| Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. 
Michael| These people dont realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
Jim| Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. 
Andy| Yeah.
Jim| Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Andy| I play the banjo.
Jim| Hold on, let me think about that, yes, thatll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Andy|  You know I can, my man.
Jim| Yup. Thats perfect.
Karen| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Andy| Im gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
Jim| Perfect.
Karen| What is going on?
Jim| ...Im messing with Andy. Im sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Karen| I love it. I want in. Whos the target?
Jim| ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... 
Karen| Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Jim| Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... well give her a break. Lets think of someone else.
Michael| All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, theres somebody Id like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . Im prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
Angela| Do you really expect us to believe youre somebody else?
Michael| Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, thats just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebodys bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Dont drop the soap! Dont drop the soap!
Ryan| Michael, please. 
Jim| Where... did you learn all of this?
Michael| Internet. 
Jim| So, not prison.
Michael| And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what Im saying. Its not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. 
Jim| Whatd you do, Prison Mike?
Michael| I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... presidents son. And held him for ransom.
Jim| That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Michael| And I nevah got caught, neither.
Jim| Well, youre... in... prison, but, mmhmm. 
Pam| Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Michael| Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Andy| Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
Michael| Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Dwight| Prison Mike. Whats the very very worst thing about prison?
Angela| Dont encourage him, Dwight. 
Michael| The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And theyd come down, and theyd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Karen| Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Michael| No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobodys bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesnt sound so great, does it?
Pam| Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Martin| Yeah, that... wasnt really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, Ive seen on television. But it didnt remind me of my time in prison. 
Michael| Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. 
Jim| Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. 
Michael| No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what its like to have freedom. And if this doesnt bother them, then I am out of ideas.
Kevin|  Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Hannah| Shh! 
Toby|  This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? 
Toby| Michael. Whys everyone locked in the conference room?
Michael| They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Toby| Well, youre going to have to let em out. Or... or I will.
Michael| Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Toby| You know theyre teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. Theyre teasing you. To be funny.
Michael|  Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why dont you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
Michael| Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. 
Andy|  So weve been told, and some choose to believe it, I know theyre wrong, wait and see, cause one day well find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
