Karen| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Karen| Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Jim| Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
Jim|  I dont have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwights stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."
Dwight| No! Youll thank me later.
Michael| There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
Jan| Michael.
Michael| ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
Jan| Michael.
Michael|  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
Jan| Michael.
Michael| Yes.
Jan| I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Michael| I dont understand.
Jan| The board voted last night to close your branch.
Michael| On whoms authority?
Jan| The boards.
Michael| What?
Jan| Im very sorry. I dont relish telling you this. Youve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Michael| Youre welcome.
Jan| A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
Michael| Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Jan| Well, we havent made final decisions about personnel yet. But youre a severance package person.
Michael| Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I dont really get it cause were not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Jan| Well, its not all about numbers, Michael.
Michael| Well...
Jan| Its... its about talent.
Michael| Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Jan| Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our companys future.
Michael| Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
Michael| It is an outrage, thats all. Its... heyre making a huge, huge mistake. Lets see Josh replace these people. Lets see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they dont. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
Michael| Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.
Dwight| Hey stranger.
Michael| Dont say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Dwight| Sorry. I just feel like we havent talked in awhile.
Michael| Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
Dwight | When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michaels book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute." 
Karen| Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... 
Jim| Really? Wow... thats bad.
Andy| Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing?  In your face!
Jim| Well, I work here now.
Andy| Mmmm.. suck-ah!
Pam| Are you okay?
Michael| Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Pam| What did Jan want?
Michael| Nothing. Just checking in. I cant tell you, so...
Pam| What cant you tell me?
Michael| Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make?  Well be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
Pam| What?!
Michael| What?
Pam| You just said that were gonna be gone...?
Michael| Do I have any messages?
Pam| Michael, whats going on?
Michael| Ok, ok...
Michael|  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
Toby| Michael, uh... we shouldnt be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
Michael| You knew about this all along, didnt you?
Toby| Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Michael| Traitor. You are a traitor.
Angela| What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Michael| I dont know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Ryan| It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Angela| I dont want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyones to blame.
Kelly| If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Andy|  Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
Jim| I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, its going to be weird that its all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Stanley| I couldnt be happier. Im gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel.  I really couldnt be happier.
Pam| Its a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe thatll stop now.
Roy| What does that mean?
Kevin| Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Roy| I dont really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Dont Know What You Got (Till Its Gone)"? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
Darryl| Hey Mike.
Michael| Darryl. Noble Darryl. 
Darryl| Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Michael| I know, I know. Well, Ill land on my feet. Dont worry about me.
Darryl| I wasnt.
Michael| So, youll be okay too. Youre a warrior. Youre smart, capable. Youll find something else and...
Darryl| Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So hes keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
Michael| Awesome.
Michael| This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
Michael| All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Lets go.
Dwight| Yes!
Pam| Oh, good... youre bringing Dwight.
Michael| Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Dwight| Whats the plan?
Michael| Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him hes making a mistake... save the branch.
Dwight| Can I drive?
Michael| No... way.
Dwight| Shotgun!
Michael| No. Theres no one else.
Dwight| Still.
Dwight| Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and wont be coming back into the office.
Michael| Okay, okay. Um...
Dwight| But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here.
Michael| Why?
Dwight| Christmas card list.
Michael| You sent him cards? You never met him.
Dwight| But when I do, well have something to talk about.
Jim| Hey, do you have a second?
Josh| Sure, whats up?
Jim| I know its not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know whos coming over here from Scranton?
Josh| I honestly dont. I dont know.
Jim| Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Josh| You know what, Jim, I wouldnt worry about it.
Jim| What does that mean?
Jan| Hi.
Josh| Jan, hey.
Jan| Oh, good. Youre both here. Ready to talk logistics?
Ryan|  I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but Im gonna go someplace else and youre gonna go someplace else. It just doesnt make sense.
Ryan| This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michaels gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think its for the best.
Michael| Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and hes like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. Youre a bad person." Its very dramatic.  Although, I cant say I was a big fan of  Bowling for Columbine, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like Kingpin. And it wasnt. It was something else.
Jan| So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, youll be his number two.
Josh| Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
Jan| Awesome.
Josh| Excuse me, Jan, Im sorry... Im gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
Jan| Wha... excuse... why not?
Josh| As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
Jan| Today?
Josh| 
Jan| You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Josh| 
Jan| Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Josh| Im sorry, all right? Its done, its done.
Jan| Im gonna make some calls.
Jim| Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Dwight| So, do you know what youre gonna say when he shows up?
Michael| I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
Dwight| No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, Ill be him, you be you. Lets practice.
Michael| All right.
Dwight|  Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
M ichael| Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
Dwight| Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Michael | Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Dwight| Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. Its simple dollars and cents.
Michael| Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
Dwight| Listen, Scott... were losing money, okay? Its not a charity; its a business. And its a dying business.
Michael|  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. Hes not going to say any of that.
Dwight|  Whoa hey, why not?
Michael| Because hed be intimidated and I, just... lets start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Dwight| Okay.
Michael| Dont touch me this time.
Dwight|  Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Michael| Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
Dwight|  Uh!
Jan| So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
Jim| Wow.
Jan| And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Jim| Thank you.
Jan| Yeah.
Jim| No, its just Im not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
Jan| Michael.
Jim| No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And Im not really ready to revist that, I dont think.
Jan| Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Jim| Okay.
Phyllis| Hey guys. Uh, Im trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, were never gonna see each other again.
Kevin| Where are we going?
Phyllis| I thought maybe DJs.
Kevin| How about Cuginos?
Angela| I dont want to go all the way to Dunmore.
Kevin| How bout Coopers then?
Angela| No seafood.
Kevin| But, I dont want to go to DJs.
Angela| Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
Phyllis| Okay, forget it. 
Kevin| Hooters?
Angela| No.
Dwight| Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids.
Michael| 
Jan|  Wheres Michael?
Pam| Hes not here. I dont know where he is.
Jan|  Wha... whats going on here?
Phyllis| We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Jan| Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? Im sure there is a better way to do this but Ive drive something like 400 miles today and Im completely exhausted so Im just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
Angela| Yes!
Kevin| Yes! 
Phyllis| Stanley! 
Pam| Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Jan| Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
Pam| Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
Jan| Back?
Pam| Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
Jan| Uh, we dont know. Probably. A few.
Dwight|  who is it?
Michael| The office.
Dwight| Gonna get it?
Michael| No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Pam| I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
Ryan| Is Jim coming back.
Pam| Thats, um... I hadnt thought about it, huh.
Ryan| I just dont want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Pam| Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
Ryan| Oh, yeah, totally.
Kelly| Ahhhhh!  Im so happy we dont have to break up now, Ryan!  This is the best day of my whole l ife!
Karen| What you gonna do?
Jim| I really dont know.  How you doing with all this?
Karen| You know, Im fine. Ill be better when I know if I have a job.
Jim| Youd actually move to Scranton?
Karen| Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Jim| New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you Id move to New York?
Karen| Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Josh| Hey Andy!
Andy|  Whats up, Josh?
Josh| I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
Andy| Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
Michael| Anything?
Dwight| Nothing. 
Michael| What if this doesnt work? What is the office actually goes under?
Dwight| Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Michael|  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
Dwight| My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Michael| That was hilarious. The foam ...
Dwight| Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Michael| Oh, right. Okay, thats enough. Thats good.
Dwight| What were your favorite moments?
Michael| Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. 
Dwight| What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Michael| God, Dwight!
Dwight| Well, it doesnt...
Kevin| Hey Pam, were going to Poor Richards. Creeds buying shots.
Pam| No thanks, guys.
Kevin| All right.
Pam| Have fun though.
Kevin| Cool.
Phyllis| Hey, I hear Jims coming back.
Pam| Really? Where did you hear that?
Phyllis| I was...
Kevin|  Hey Ryan, you coming?
Ryan| Uh yeah, well meet you there.
Kevin| Awesome. Lets go, Phyllis.
Phyllis|  Ill tell you later.
Pam| Okay.
Roy| Crazy day, huh?
Pam| Yeah.
Roy| Yeah, man! Im uh... Im really glad youre still gonna be working here.
Pam| Yeah, me too.
Pam| Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. Theres another annoying boss, another desk, Id have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Jim| Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... its not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Karen| Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
Jim| Okay.
Karen| Yeah, Im happy he said that. I mean, I dont think hes into me or anything, but, Im kind of into him. So...there you go.
Michael| What are we still doing here? Its over. Lets go home. Get the car.
Dwight| 
Michael| Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybodys jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
Dwight|  Oh my God!
Michael| What?!
Dwight| Stranford is closed! Michael, were not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.
Michael| We did it? We did it.
Dwight| We did it!
Michael and Dwight| We did it! We did it!
Michael| Right here! Right here! 
Michael and Dwight| Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu!
Michael| Yeah, baby!
Dwight| In your face!
Michael| We did it!
Dwight| Oh, man.
Michael| How did we do it?
Dwight| I dont ... have no idea.
Michael| I dont understand.
Toby| Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When Im 65.
