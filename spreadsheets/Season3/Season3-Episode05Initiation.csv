Dwight| Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Ryan| A dime and a nickel.
Dwight| No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Ryan| But the other one is. Ive heard that before.
Dwight| Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
Ryan| Because hes my son. The doctor is the boys mother.
Dwight| A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Ryan| He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
Dwight| A hunter.
Ryan| Its a polar bear because youre at the North Pole.
Dwight| Damn it!
Jan| Tell me what you did yesterday.
Michael| Uhhh... nothing.
Jan| Nothing?
Michael| Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Jan| I dont care how your day was Michael.
Michael| Wow. Well. Ok. I dont care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
Jan| Tell me what you did yesterday.
Michael| I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
Michael| Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
Jan| Hi, Pam.
Pam| Hi.
Jan| Im great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
Pam| Oh, I dont know if Im...
Jan| Thanks Pam.
Pam| Its weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately its like hes five.
Dwight| So you excited?
Ryan| Yeah.
Dwight| Very excited?
Ryan| Yes. Im very excited.
Dwight| Extremely excited? ... Just very?  Thats cool.
Ryan| I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwights the top salesman in the company and hes taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, Im excited.
Dwight| I am very excited. Ryan hasnt made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasnt made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Ryan| So what if theyre not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So wheres the sales office?
Dwight| When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Karen|  Hey.
Jim| What?
Karen| My chair is squeaking.
Jim| Is it?
Karen| You took my chair.
Jim| No, I didnt. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didnt take your chair.
Karen| When you get up, Im just going to take it back anyway, so...
Jim| So I guess I cant get up.
Michael| Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
Dwight| Do you know where we are, temp?
Ryan| I know where were not.
Dwight| I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  AH!  When... Damn it.
Andy| Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
Jim| Sure.
Andy| Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Karen| Thats it? Thats what you came up with?
Andy| Im acting my heart out here.
Karen| Really?
Andy| Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Announcer| Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 oclock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.
Pam| Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. Its really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Michael| Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So Im just going to have my soft pretzel, then Ill get to work, and Ill be super productive. Look out for me.
Michael|  Oh, shhh... Come on.
Dwight| And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, Im going to plant my seed in you.
Ryan| I dont think you know what youre saying.
Dwight| Smells pretty bad, doesnt it?
Ryan| Uh huh.
Dwight| Its called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Ryan| Gotcha.
Dwight| Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  Ill be right back.
Ryan| Ok.  Of course.
Stanley| I wake up every morning in a bed thats too small, drive my daughter to a school thats too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Kelly| Because they acted all tough and everything...
Michael| Uh huh.
Kelly| But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Michael|  Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Phyllis| Im just saying hi to Bob.
Michael| No, I think youre cutting in line.
Bob| Well settle down, Scott.
Michael| No, Im not going to settle down.
Stanley| No way.
Michael| Get in the back please.
Stanley| Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
Michael| Boooooo. Thank you. . Thats right.
Bob| What a pair of Marys.
Stanley| This is Pretzel Day.
Ryan| Hey Dwight, youre a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. Ill make you the ole commodor.  Ill abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, Ill really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Dwight| Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Karen|
Jim|  Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Karen| stop.
Jim| Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Karen| This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
Jim| fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Karen| This is not a proportionate response.
Jim| Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
Andy| I dont care bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Pam| Michael.
Michael| No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman Id like to see. You read my mind.
Pam| Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Michael| I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. Youre an angel.
Pam| Hey, why dont you just go up to your office, get some work done, and Ill just bring you a pretzel.
Michael| Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
Pam| You know, I just think its really important that you be productive today.
Michael| Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. Ill be back.
Dwight| It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Ryan| Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what youre doing. I get it.
Dwight| You know what your problem is? You know why you havent made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Ryan| Yeah.
Dwight| Come on!
Stanley| Thank you!
Michael| Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Pretzel guy| We do.
Michael| Thank God.
Pretzel guy| And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.
Michael| Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
Pretzel guy| The Works. You got it.
Michael| All right! Thank you!
Dwight| Please be seated.
Ryan| Who was that?
Dwight| Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Ryan| Is that your Cousin Mose?
Dwight| Yes.
Dwight| Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I wont hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Dwight| What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Ryan| Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
Dwight| Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflins suicide?
Ryan| Depression?
Dwight| Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Kelly| I cant believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Angela| Sales take a long time.
Kelly| Oh my God, Im so worried.
Angela| Im sure Dwight will protect him.
Kelly| I dont know. Dwights so weird.
Angela| Hes not weird, hes just individualistic.
Kelly| No, hes a freak.
Angela| Youre a freak!
Dwight| Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scotts greatest fear?
Ryan| Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
Dwight| Wrong. Hes not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what its all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
Ryan| No. Ok. All right. All right. Its over. This is over.  OK.
Dwight| Wrestle him to the ground.
Ryan| No, youre a freak. Im not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Dwight| Ryan. Dont. Ryan! You dont have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Cousin Mose| Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.
Dwight| Where are all the animals?
Dwight| Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Dwight| You still mad? Its just Jim and I didnt get along, and I didnt want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Ryan| Look, that, thats not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Dwight| Screwgun. The sales call!
Kevin|  Hey! Hey!
Michael| Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. Whats going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Lets make a deal. So what is the deal?
Dwight| Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. Thats why youre losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Ryan| Wait, can you go back?
Dwight| Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Ryan| Ok, Im going to establish time frames.
Dwight| Good.
Ryan| Im going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".
Dwight| Right.
Ryan| Im going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Dwight| Uh huh.
Ryan| Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Dwight| Exactly. Yes.
Ryan| Im going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Michael| Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
Toby| Second?
Michael| Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
Kevin| Account...? Michael, what is going on?
Michael| And I will be taking questions.
Pam| Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Phyllis| Whats on your suit?
Michael| Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, Im going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think were getting a lot done, dont you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
Ryan| They really didnt like me.
Dwight| They did not. They didnt have to say it to your face.
Ryan| I dont get it. I dont get what I did wrong.
Dwight| Not everythings a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. Its those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? Theyre going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Ryan| You drive.
Pam| Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. Hes, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Dwight|  Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Ryan| I think about that all the time.
Kevin| Night, Pam.
Pam| Night.
Michael| Hey, what time is it?
Pam| 20 past 5.
Michael| AM or PM?
Pam| PM.
Michael| Oh, good.
Pam| These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
Michael| Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
Pam| This is a huge sale.
Michael| Yes. Right. Good.
Pam| Night, Michael.
Michael| Goodnight!
Pam|  Dunder Mifflin.
Jim| Ah, hey.
Pam| Oh my God.
Jim| Hi.
Pam| Hi.
Jim| Sorry, I forgot Kevins extension. Its a fantasy football thing.
Pam| Oh.
Jim| And I was just going to go through the system cause I didnt think youd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Pam| I had to work late. Jans making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Jim| Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Pam| Yeah, totally. So...
Jim| So...
Pam| Do you...
Jim| Oh, Im sorry. Go ahead.
Pam| Uh, no, I um. Everythings pretty much the same here.
Jim| Oh, good.
Pam| A little different. What time is it there?
Jim| What time is it here? Um, were in the same time zone.
Pam| Oh, yeah. Right.
Jim| How far away did you think we were?
Pam| I dont know. It felt far.
Jim| Yeah. I have a question for you.
Pam| What?
Jim| How many words per minute does the average person type?
Pam| I type 90.
Jim| Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesnt even type 90.
Pam| Its true.
Jim| Ok, I said average.
Pam| 70? How many do you type?
Jim| Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Pam| Come on. Tell me.
Jim| No.
Pam| You have to tell me now.
Jim| 65. Ok, no need to laugh.
Pam| No, its, thats respectable.
Jim| Respectable?
Pam| So ok. Im watching the movie, by myself...
Jim| Right.
Pam| Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
Jim| Ok.
Pam| And, Im freaking out.
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| That movie is so scary!
Jim| I know!
Pam| But Im holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Jim| No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Pam| Because I got it at Blockbuster and they dont put the pictures on the box.
Jim| No, youre making this up!
Pam| Would I make that up?
Jim| Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Pam| Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
Jim| And how many kitchens?
Pam| I have one kitchen.
Jim| Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
Pam| Its actually...
Jim| Most apartments these days have like three.
Pam| Three kitchens?
Jim| Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Pam|  Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Jim| Pam?
Ryan| Yeah. Yeah.
Jim| Pam?
Pam| Um. Ok, bye.
Jim| Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Pam| No, I was um...
Jim| Oh, no no.
Pam| You have to go?
Jim| Yeah, uh, well.
Pam| No, I should probably go too.
Jim| Ok.
Pam| I mean, yeah.
Jim| Yeah. Bye Pam.
Pam| Bye Jim.
Stanley| Three hundred and sixty four days, till the next Pretzel Day.
