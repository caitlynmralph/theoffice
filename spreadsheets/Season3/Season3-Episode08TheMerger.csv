Jim| The Stamford branch is closing and everybodys just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Andy|  Thats the other thing you got to watch out...   Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Jim| Yeah.
Andy| So whats he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite mens magazines?
Jim| You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Andy| Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Jim| Sounds good Andy.
Karen| This is going to be an adventure.
Jim| Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, Im out of here. See you later?
Karen| Right on.  Hey is that Joshs computer?
Andy| What?
Pam| Hey!
Toby| Hey.
Pam| Howd the run go?
Toby| Ah, pretty good. I finished.
Pam| Thats great!
Dwight| Psh, why is that great?
Pam| Because he accomplished something.
Dwight| What was your mile time?
Toby| About seven.
Dwight|  I could beat that on a skateboard.
Toby| Well, that has wheels.
Dwight| Yeah, well my feet dont. And I can still crush that time.
Pam| Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
Dwight| Lets just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Pam| Really?
Dwight| I am fast. To give you a reference point. Im somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Dwight| Man, what is taking Toby so long?
Pam| Oh, Ill just time him later.
Dwight| And youll compare the times?
Pam| Yeah. Are you ready?
Dwight| No, my groin...
Pam| Set
Dwight| ...is really tight.
Pam| Go!
Dwight| I cant...
Pam| Am I being mean to Dwight? I dont know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isnt even a stopwatch. Its a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if youre going to beat Toby.
Dwight| Aaaaah!
Pam| I should probably get back to work.
Michael| Here... Whos here?
Dwight| Nametag?
Michael| Yes, please.
Dwight| Karen Filippelli.
Michael| Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Dwight| Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Michael| Okay.
Michael| My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. Thats all Im going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.
Michael| Whos next?
Dwight| Thats Andy Bernard.
Michael| Andy Bernard.
Dwight| If I were you...
Michael| Saint Bernard.
Dwight| ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Michael| What?
Dwight| ...before noon...
Michael| Im not...
Dwight| ...to consolidate power.
Michael| Im not firing somebody on the first day.
Dwight| No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
Dwight| The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Pam| Good morning!
Michael| Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man whos way out of your league.
Pam| Okay.
Pam| Yes! Im in a good mood today! Im excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. Thats always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
Hannah| Hello?
Michael| Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Dwight| Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael| Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Michael| You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as Im concerned,  this says Worlds Best Dad.
Michael| Ah! There he is Tony... whats your last name?
Tony| Gardner.
Michael| Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
Tony| Thanks.
Kevin| Michael, I didnt get a gift bag.
Michael| Well, theyre just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Hannah| My bags mostly pencils.
Michael| Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Kevin| Can I have your pencils?
Hannah| No.
Pam| Hi!
Karen| Hi.
Pam| Im Pam.
Karen| Karen. I love your sweater.
Pam| Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Karen| Really? Thats so cool. Ive always wanted to learn...
Michael| Welcome.
Karen| ...to knit.
Michael| Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Karen| Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Michael| Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
Andy| Ill be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. Im always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Andy| Hello.
Michael| Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Andy| And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael| A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Andy| Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
Michael| Oh.
Andy| Nifty!
Michael| They are nifty! Theyre nifty gifties.
Michael| You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
Martin| ...which is why they need a passing game.
Jim| Right.
Michael|  No way. Get him out of here. We dont want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
Jim| Okay.
Michael|  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Martin| Oh! Thanks.
Michael| Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
Jim| Hi, Im Jim. Im new here.
Pam| Oh my god! Its really you!
Jim| Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how wed never met...
Pam| I know. I dont care.
Jim| Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Pam| Its really good to see you.
Jim| You, too.
Jim| Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, were friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Dwight| Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Jim| Hey, Dwight.
Dwight| Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Jim| Okay. Sounds good.
Dwight| What are you doing?
Jim| I dont know what youre talking about.
Dwight| I have a smudge on my forehead?
Jim| No. Looks good.
Dwight| Why are you looking at my forehead?
Jim| Im not.
Dwight| Meet my eye line, Jim!
Jim| I am.
Dwight| Stop acting like an idiot!
Jim| Okay.
Ryan| Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
Jim| Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Ryan| Im good! How are you? So...
Jim| Oh, Im sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Ryan| Yeah.
Jim| Oh.
Ryan| Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Jim| You know, man, its really youre call.
Ryan| Cool, thank you.
Jim|  Let me get that for you.
Ryan| Yuh.
Jim| This one taken? No. Good.
Ryan| Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. Thats why I got the desk.
Toby| Hey, this came with the Stamford book.  Can you take care of it?
Kevin| Oh, yes I can.
Kevin| In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
Andy| Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Michael| Right.
Dwight| Hello. I dont believe weve been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Andy| Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Dwight| So youll be reporting to me, then.
Andy| Umm, on the contrary.
Dwight| My title has Manager in it.
Andy| And Im a director.
Dwight| Oh.
Andy| Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Dwight| I know everything about film. Ive seen over 240 of them.
Andy| Congratulations.
Jim| Hey, Toby!
Toby| Hey, Jim!
Jim| How are you, man?
Toby| Oh, really good.
Jim| I just wanted to say hi.
Toby| How are you? Hey. Welcome back.
Jim| Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Toby| No, Im sorry, its...
Jim| No. Its cool.
Toby| No, its nothing. Well just...
Jim| All right. Good to be back.
Toby| So... okay.
Jim| All right.
Toby| All right... sorry... sorry about that.
Jim| No problem.
Toby| It was just...
Jim|  ...what?
Toby| Nothing.
Kevin| This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh!  Shoot.
Michael|  I present the orientation video.
Dwight| We need to talk!
Michael| Not now.
Dwight| Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Michael| I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Dwight| Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Michael| It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
Dwight| Ok. Who reports to who?
Michael| I dont care! Dwight! You all report to me! Thats all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Dwight| And then if I want...
Michael| Work it out amongst your selves!
Dwight| I...
Michael| Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Dwight| I...
Michael| Will you?
Dwight| One...
Michael| Please?
Kelly| Jim!
Jim| Kelly!
Kelly| Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Jim| Really?
Kelly| Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Jim| Great. Whats new with you?
Kelly| I just told you.
Michael| Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why dont we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
Michael| Yoko shack.
Male voice| ...thank you James.
Meredith| Hey, champagne.
Michael| Nope, no. Guests only.
Kelly| Looks like salmon.
Michael| Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Kelly| I eat beef.
Michael| Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Kevin| The beef is poisoned?
Michael| No, its not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
Toby| Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Michael| Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Jim| Oh, this looks promising.
Pam| You wont be disappointed.
Michael| Lets face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But its not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. Its funny. Its got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what were all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what were all about here in Scranton. So lets just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
Video|
Michael| Sittin in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin.
Dwight| Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Michael| So check out how we live
Michael &amp; Dwight| in the Electric City!
Michael| They call it Scranton.
Dwight| What?
Michael| The Electric City. Scranton.
Dwight| What?
Michael| The Electric City. Call poison control if youre bit by a spider.
Dwight| But check that its covered by your health care provider!
Jim| It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. The Scranton Witch Project.
Michael|  I am so scared... when people dont label their personal food.
Video|
Michael| You like coal mines and you wanna see em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Dwight| But the little cars go in the compact spot
Michael and Dwight| Spot, spot, spot, spot ...
Michael|  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Michael| Well, so far, I think it is killin. I thought it would either be an A or an A+ but I completely forgot that theres an A++.
Karen|  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim| Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Karen|  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim| Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Karen|   Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Jim| You feel good?
Karen| Mm-hm.
Jim| All right.
Karen|  Karen Filippelli.
Andy| Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
Dwight| Do you mean to me? From you? Cause thats how it works.
Andy| Sure thing, buddy.
Andy| Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin on the charm.
Andy| Hey, Angela. Check this out. Its my new screen saver.
Angela| Oh.
Andy| Do you like it?
Angela| I do like it, actually.
Andy| Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Angela| Thank you.
Andy| Youre welcome.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey!
Pam| What happened to grape soda?
Jim| Oh yeah. Im trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Pam| Oh. Youve changed so much.
Jim| Well, Im evolving, Pam.
Pam| So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Jim| Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. Im uh just still getting settled.
Pam| Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Jim| Nope. Youre not interrupting anything. Nope. Im...
Michael| All right.
Jim| Dont...
Michael| Okay.
Jim| All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Pam| Yeah. I know, me too.
Jim| All right!
Pam| The days going fine. Its been a little chaotic but its fine. Its great! A lot of distractions. But, its good.
Hannah|  Take a picture. Itll last longer.
Ryan| Im sorry. Its just, its a little distracting.
Creed| Ditto that, my brother.
Hannah| Look whats on his computer.
Michael| What is that? A squids eye or...
Hannah| Its my left breast.
Michael| How did you...
Creed| Right place at the right time.
Karen| Uh, whats that smell?
Phyllis| What smell?
Karen| Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Phyllis| Oh, Ill help you find it.
Karen| Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Phyllis| What is it?
Karen| I... I... I, uh, think Im just allergic to your perfume.
Phyllis| My perfume?
Karen| Its just my crazy nose. Im... uh, used to different smells.
Phyllis| Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. Its made from real pine.
Karen| Whos Bob Vance?
Phyllis| You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Stanley| I dont know who these new people think they are. Ive sat downwind of Phyllis stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
Michael| People hate people that are different from them. Thats natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the Integration Celebration. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
Michael| I know what a lot of you must be thinking. Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. Theres supposed to be music and its... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Dwight| Do you have batteries?
Michael| Ssshh stupid! Um...
Andy|
Michael| Thats it!
Andy|  What is love?
Michael| Yes, yes! Okay!
Andy| Baby, dont hurt me.
Michael| Okay, here we go.
Andy &amp; Michael| Dont hurt me! Baby, dont hurt me!
Michael| Oh!
Andy| Baby, dont hurt me!
Michael| Oh! Oh! Oh!
Andy| Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Michael| Scuse me! Scuse me!
Andy &amp; Michael| Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
Michael| You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Andy| Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Michael| You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, whys my nose so itchy!
Andy| Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Michael|  Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Dwight| Very funny, Michael!
Michael| Okay! Okay!
Dwight| Really funny, Michael!
Michael| All right, all right, Im on a roll.
Michael| Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Karen| Shouldnt we be equals?
Michael| Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Tony| Uh... this is difficult, for me.
Michael| I understand. Were all friends.
Tony| No. I mean I cant physically. I cant get on the table.
Michael| Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Tony|
Michael| You know what? Ill help. I will...
Tony| No, please. No.
Michael| Dont be shy! Dwight! Lets do this!
Dwight| Do this. Come on. Ready?
Michael| Come on. Were doing this thing! Lets get up.
Dwight| On three. One... two... three.
Michael| Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Im under this... Im under this hock here. I dont know what Im grabbing here.
Tony| All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
Michael| Weve almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Tony| Let me go!
Michael| Im right in your crack!
Tony| Put me down right...
Michael| Up and over.
Tony| Put me down!
Michael| Up and over.
Tony| Put me down right now!
Michael| Youve got it.
Tony| IVE HAD ENOUGH!
Michael| Youve got it, youve got it.
Tony| PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
Michael| Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Dwight| Hey, hey. Easy.
Michael| Easy.
Tony| Im sorry!
Michael| Dont...
Tony| Its just not going to work for me.
Michael| What...
Tony| I have to go.
Michael| I dont understand.
Tony| I was on the fence about this and... its just not a good fit.
Michael| Well, well squeeze you in.
Tony| I cant work here. I have to quit.
Michael| You cant quit! On the first day. Thats  heresy, my friend!  Okay, lets talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause hes... what?
Tony| No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. Its just your management style.
Michael| My management style? So... didnt you think Lazy Scranton was funny?
Tony| No. Was it supposed to be funny?
Michael| Okay. Well, dont bother quitting because youre fired.
Tony| Excuse me?
Michael| You are fired! Im sorry, but we dont have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Tony| But theres nothing in my desk except coupons.
Michael| Dont try to apologize to me, man! Its too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Dwight| That was my advice. Remember? Im the one who suggested that you fire him.
Michael| Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Dwight| And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would none be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Andy| Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
Hannah| Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Angela| Maybe thats because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Michael| Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Stanley| Back to work. We dont have to get along. We just have to work together.
Michael| No. We do have to get along. Cant we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
Michael| The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
Michael| Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Dwight| What!
Michael| Yeah! They punkd us! They punkd us good! Come on. Come on!
Karen| Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Jim| Does he ever.
Michael| Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Dwight| YEAH!
Michael| Yeah.
Toby| I dont... I dont think we can do that.
Michael| Go home, Toby. Just...
Martin| Hey! Why doesnt your car have a flat tire?
Michael| Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. Its so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
Hannah| For crying out loud.
Michael| No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. Youre playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Dont, oh...
Martin|  Whats up with this guy?
Stanley| Got an hour? Ill try to explain.
Michael| THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
Stanley| Trust me. It only gets worse.
Martin| Is he always like this?
Ryan| Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Hannah| When do people work?
Phyllis| Oh, we find little times during the day.
Karen| How are we going to get home?
Phyllis| Bob Vance has an air pump. He said hed fill all our tires up.
Karen| Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
Michael| See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although thatll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!
Jan| Michael!
Michael| Hi, Jan!
Jan| Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Michael| I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Jan| Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Michael| Yes.
Jan| You do?
Michael| But do you realize that that was actually Dwights idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Jan| What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Michael| What?
Jan| Hes the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Michael| Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
Michael| So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Dwight| If he even wants it. It doesnt come with a pay raise.
Jim| Yeah, it does, actually.
Dwight| So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael| Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Andy| Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Michael| Thank you, Andy. Thats... very kind. Thanks.
Dwight| And I have to say your leadership...
Michael| Shut it...
Dwight| has brought...
Michael| Shut it! Thats...  suck up!
Jim|  Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
Karen|  Im at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Jim|  Whats wrong? You didnt have a good first day?
Karen| Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Coopers in an hour? I need a drink.
Jim| Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Karen| Yeah.
Jim| Ok, thanks.
Karen| Ok.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Hey!
Jim| I thought you had already... left.
Pam| Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Jim| Oh... Good.
Pam| Whats up?
Jim| Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Pam| What do you mean?
Jim| I just think I should tell you that... Ive sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Pam| Oh. Thats totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Jim| O..ok. Um..good.
Pam| Were friends. Well always be friends.
Jim| Right.
Pam| Its good to have you back.
Jim| Yeah. Good to be back.
Meredith| Whered you get that salad?
Kevin| Staples.
Andy| Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Dwight| Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Andy| Yeah, my Xterras pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Dwight| Xterras not even a real word.
Andy| Actually, it is. Its Latin for "earth."
Dwight| Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Andy| Yeah.
Dwight| That makes sense. Id rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Andy| Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Dwight| Well I hope 1985 has a time machine cause I drive an 87.
Andy| Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
Dwight| Speaking of funerals, why dont you go ahead and go die.
Andy| Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Dwight| Idiot!
Andy| If I were an idiot, Id be driving a TransAm.
Dwight| If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Andy|  Idiot!
Dwight|  Youre the idiot!
Andy|  Nice comeback!
Dwight|  I was making fun of your comeback! Thats why it worked.  Totally got the best of that interchange.
