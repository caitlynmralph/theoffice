Jim| All right, lets get started. Umm... Oh, first off, were supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... lets push cardstock this week. Uh, also...  what is this?
Dwight| Tape recorder.
Jim| For what?
Dwight| For recording. Michael is on vacation and hes asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Jim| OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Karen| Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, its the six month commitment.
Jim| Oh my God, Dwight, whatre you doing?
Dwight| What?
Jim| Youre not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Dwight| Im not.
Jim| Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, thats making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! Hes got a knife!
Dwight| I do not have a knife!
Jim| No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanleys neck?!
Dwight|  Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
Jim|  Dwight Schrute is now wearing a babys bonnet.
Dwight| Give me it. I am not.
Phyllis| Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
Dwight| Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
Karen| Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Jim| Oh my God, Karen, youre right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Dwight| You cant see... You cant see my stomach.
Andy| I am now chopping off Phyllis head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Michael| Hey, mon!
Pam| Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  thats nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Michael| Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Pam| OK.
Michael| Just relax, OK? Ill get to all of it later.
Pam| Its kind of serious.
Michael| Arent you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
Pam| How was Jamaica?
Michael| It was
so| good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back.
Stanley| Oh, Michael, Im glad youre here.
Michael| Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
Stanley| My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
Michael| OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Stanley| They said I should talk to you.
Michael| Well, I am just getting settled in. So, Im gonna...
Stanley| I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Michael| You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Jim| You want to talk about it?
Karen| Nope.
Karen| I still havent found an apartment yet. Im living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didnt think itd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
Michael| Feelin hot, hot, hot!  Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Thats all I know so far, but Im gonna keep practicing.
Pam| Thats good.
Michael| You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
Pam| Huh.
Michael| Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
Pam| Its kind of an impoverished country.
Michael| Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Pam| But you cant today, were doing inventory.
Michael| Inventorys at the end of December.
Pam| We couldnt do it without you, so we postponed.
Michael| I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Michael| Inventory is boring. In the islands, they dont make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
Michael| Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
Angela| By the end of the day? Thats impossible.
Michael| The Jamaicans dont have a word for "impossible."
Jim| Yep, its English, its "impossible."
Angela| Michael, theres no way we can do it in time.
Michael| How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. Thats all you need.
Michael| Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
Pam| Oh my God. Is that Jan?
Everybody| What? Where?
Pam| On the left.
Everybody| Oh yeah, oh my God.
Michael| No, no, no. No, thats a German woman named Urkel Grue.
Michael| Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. Thats all Im gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
Michael|  Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Packer| Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Michael| Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
Packer| You took the ice queen? I dont buy it.
Michael| Well Im looking at a photo, right now. And Im telling ya, could be in Maxim.
Packer| They wouldnt give you a subscription to Maxim.
Michael| Oh no?
Packer| No.
Michael| OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
Packer| Well, no. I got nothing.
Michael| Check it again. Hit refresh.
Packer| Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
Michael| OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
Packaging|@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh.
Packer| Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
Michael| Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Wheres Darryl?
Roy| Hes in the office.
Michael| OK, Hey, man, hows it going?
Darryl| All right, whats up Mike?
Michael| Thats great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
Darryl| Yup.
Michael| OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
Darryl| Uh huh.
Michael| OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
Darryl| Yup.
Michael| And you sent that out to everyone?
Darryl| Mike, Im very busy down here.
Jim| Yikes.
Kevin| Already sent it to you my friend.
Jim| Fantastic.
Andy| Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| You OK?
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| You sure?
Jim| Yeah. Yes. Um, Im just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Pam| Oh. You want to talk about it?
Jim| Really?
Michael| I have a special assignment for you.
Dwight| Whos the target?
Michael| A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
Dwight| Whats it of?
Michael| Not important.
Dwight| Unless youre willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Michael| OK, forget it.
Dwight| OK, I accept it.
Jim| So, I dunno, I just feel likes weve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Pam| Hmm.
Jim| Hmm, what?
Pam| How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
Jim| Yeah, I guess.
Pam| Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Pam| No, I didnt mind helping Jim with his problem. Thats what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Jim| Hey, thanks a lot.
Pam| Oh, dont worry about it. I mean, its better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Jim| Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
Toby| Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Michael| Not now, not ever.
Toby| About you and Jan.
Michael| Aww, none of your business.
Toby| Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, youve entered into an intimate relationship.
Michael| That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
Toby| Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we dont talk now.
Michael| This is probably the icebreaker you need.
Toby| You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
Michael| I bet you would love all the details, wouldnt you? Skeevy little perv.
Toby| All right, if youre having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
Michael| No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
Toby| All right, thanks Michael.
Michael| OK.
Angela| OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and youre not helping.
Karen| What are the ingredients of poi?
Phyllis| I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Angela| Did you try the petting zoo?
Pam|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, its Jan on the phone for you.
Michael| Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her Im not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
Pam| Hell call you back. OK, great.
Michael| She bought it?  OK. OK.
Dwight|  Michael hit a deer?
Dwight| Michael! Michael!  Theres an emergency in the warehouse.
Michael| There an accident? Somebody hurt?
Dwight| No, its... involves the photograph.
Michael| Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
Roy|  Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Michael| All right.
Roy| That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Michael| Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
Kevin| Jan.
Michael| No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
Jim| Urkel Grue.
Michael| My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Lets be professional, all right?
Michael| Feelin... feelin hot, hot, hot!
Pam| Hey.
Michael| Hey.
Pam| What are you doing out here?
Michael| Island living. You know?
Pam| Jan called. Shes coming in later to talk to you.
Michael| Did she say what its about?
Pam| Thats all she said.
Andy| Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot
Jim| Uh, I think you dropped this
Karen| You sure?
Jim| Definitely.
Dwight| I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Michael| There are copies in the bathroom?
Dwight| There were. A lot of them.
Michael| All right.
Karen| I think I owe you one.
Pam| Sorry?
Karen| For talking sense into Halpert. The Days Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Pam| Oh, yeah, no. Dont worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Karen| Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
Pam| Sure.
Darryl| Oh, yes! Yes! Whatd I tell you? I knew hed turn up  You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Dwight| Who did this to you?  Where is he?
Pam| What? No, its not... its nothing.
Dwight|  Its hot in here.
Pam| Yeah.
Dwight| Yeah.
Pam|  Thanks. You dont need to stay here.
Dwight| I know.  So youre PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Jan| Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
Michael| Guh.
Kevin| Hi Jan, you look... tan.
Jan| I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Kevin| Yeah. How was it?
Jan| Very sunny. Familys important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Michael| OK, yup.
Jan| Why am I here, Michael?
Michael| I...
Jan| In the last year, Ive gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Michael| I... I... Yes.
Jan| I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Michael| OK, yeah.
Jan| This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I dont know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least thats what Dr. Perry thinks.
Michael| Who is Dr. Perry? I...
Jan| This is the point, OK? Youre wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
Michael| And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
Jan| Good, good.
Michael| So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
Jan| Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Michael| Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -
Jan| Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Michael| Jan, you... complete... me.
Jan| Oh, God.
Roy| Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
Pam| Yeah.
Roy| I was definitely right.  Oh, brother.
Kevin| What am I going to do?  Im gonna hang it up at home. I dont have a lot of art.
