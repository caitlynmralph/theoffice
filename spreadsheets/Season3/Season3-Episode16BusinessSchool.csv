Michael| Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Kevin| My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Michael| Huh?
Kevin| I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Michael| Pop quiz.
Kevin| ...What?
Michael| Why is today a special day?
Kevin| I almost died.
Michael| Todays a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Ryan| You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Michael| In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Kevin| Wow.
Ryan| If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... Id be stupid
not| to do it, right?
Michael| A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Michael| Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing Ive ever said to you?
Dwight| "Dont be an idiot." Changed my life.
Dwight| Whenever Im about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Michael| Will they throw their hats, you think?
Ryan| What?
Michael| A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Ryan| Y-You understand nobodys graduating.
Michael| Yeah, I know, I know. Im just saying if they did throw their hats Ive got a great line for that "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
Ryan| ...It doesnt apply.
Michael| I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes youre such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
Ryan| Quit it!
Michael| We have fun.
Roy| I cant for your art show tonight.
Pam| Okay, just so you know, its just the students from my class in a little studio.
Roy| I-I wouldnt miss it for the world.
Pam| Thanks.
Pam| Im really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I dont mean it to be braggy.
Roy| Love ya.
Pam| You too.
Jim| Pams with Roy. Im with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin on.
Kelly| I cant believe youre back together with Roy!
Pam| Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Kelly| Oh my God. Youre so in love now.
Pam| Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
Kelly| Oh, art show!
Pam| I mean, its not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Kelly| ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... Ill be there. For sure.
Michael| Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
College Student| ....Dude.
Dwight| ...Oh my God. Animal stool.
Pam| Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight| Solving a mystery, if thats quite alright with you.  Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Karen| Oh my God!
Dwight| BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Stanley| Goooood bye.
Angela|  ... Please dont let that stupid thing near me...
Michael| Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Ryan| ...Dunder-Mifflin cant compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Michael| I cant hear what hes saying, but he looks like hes really into it.
Dwight| We have... a bat... in the office.
Toby| The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Angela| Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Jim| Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six.
Dwight| At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Jim| Im sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Dwight| What? Whats so wierd?
Jim| The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. Theres no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well.
Ryan| And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael| Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someones textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think youre inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
Dwight|  This is your job, Halpert.
Jim| Ow!
Karen| Oh, what happened?
Jim| That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. Its white hot.
Karen| But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
Jim| What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Dwight| No... no. One crisis at a time.
Dwight| If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesnt mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Michael| So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?
Toby| Oh, this looks great. Id, Id love to be there, but my daughters play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Pam| Oh! No, you should go.
Toby| Well, its important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Michael| Okay, Im seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Ryan| Michael.
Michael| ...And products!
Ryan| What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Michael| Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Business Student 1| Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael| We cant overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
Karen| Hey Jim, heres the aspirin you wanted.
Jim| Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Karen| What glare?
Jim| The glare off Angelas crucifix? Its blinding.
Dwight| I dont have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbors dog.
Dwight| Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Creed| Sure.
Dwight| --to use sudden violence.
Creed| Okay.
Dwight| Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Creed| What size?
Business Student 2 | What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Michael| ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee youll come back.
Business Student 2| Has anyone ever come back?
Michael| ...We dont want them back, cause theyre... stupid.
Business Student 3| How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Michael| Nice try, hows your Pollack-says-what index?
Business Student 3| ...What?
Michael| Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Business Student 1| By your own employees calculation youll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
Michael| ...Wait, Ryan said that?
Kelly| What are you doing? Youd better not hurt that little bat.
Creed| Animals cant feel pain.
Kelly| Dont hurt that bat, Creed! Its a living thing with feelings and a family!
Dwight| Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Kelly| AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Kevin|  I... am a hero!
Michael| Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
Business Student 2| But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
Michael| David will always beat Goliath.
Business Student 1| But theres five Goliaths, theres... Staples, Officemax...
Michael| Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what were learning in business school?
Business Student 1| But in the big picture...
Michael| Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Cant you understand that? No, you cant. Youre too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks hes a tease. Well you know what? He doesnt know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!
Ryan| ...It wasnt personal.
Michael| Business is always personal. Its the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
Ryan| Pack my--?
Michael| You heard me, pack your things.
Meredith| I really want to come out!
Creed| Good night, Mary Beth!
Jim| So... youre cool to just wait here for animal control?
Dwight| Animal control? Ive been controlling animals since I was six.
Jim| Cool. Okay. Im gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... theres just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Dwight| Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Dwight| Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Pam| ...And its all from the same series.
Woman| Oh.
Pam| Called Impressions.
Woman| Oh.
Pam| Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Woman| Maybe one day.
Pam| I hope so.
Woman| Mmm.
Pam| I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you?
Roy| Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Pam| Hey, Kenny.
Kenny| Hey Pam.
Roy| How bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? Thats... pretty cool, huh?
Dwight| Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!
Meredith| Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Dwight| Hold still, woman!
Meredith| Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Dwight| ... ... Youre welcome.
Roy| Its cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Pam| Yeah, Ill just, Ill drive myself home.
Roy| To my place?
Pam| Maybe, Im a little tired.
Roy| Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Pam| Thank you.
Ryan| Look, Im sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you dont have to fire me.
Michael| Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Ryan| To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Michael| A good manager doesnt fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Oscar| Youre the one who said we needed more culture.
Gil| This is culture to you?
Oscar| Its her first try.
Gil| Yeah, on Van Goghs first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
Oscar| Meaning what?
Gil| Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
Oscar| Well, those arent Pams strong points.
Gil| Yeah, exactly. Thats why this is... motel art.
Artist| Thanks for coming.
Michael| Pam-casso! Sorry Im late, I had to race across town.
Pam| Oh, Michael.
Michael| Wow! You did these... freehand?
Pam| Yep.
Michael| My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
Pam| What do you mean?
Michael| I dont see a... price.
Pam| Um... you wanna buy it?
Michael| Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, theres my... window, and theres my car! That your car?
Pam| Uh-huh.
Michael| That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam|  ... Thank you.
Michael| What?
Pam| Do you have something in your pocket?
Michael| ...Chunky. Do you want half?
Pam| No thank you.
Michael| Okay.
Michael| It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
Kelly| Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Ryan| Its only temporary, okay? Dont get excited.
Kelly| I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont, I wont...
