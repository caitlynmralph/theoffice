Jim|  Its kind of blurry.  Thats better.  Question.  What kind of bear is best?
Dwight| Thats a ridiculous question.
Jim| False.  Black bear.
Dwight| Well thats debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Jim| Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Dwight| Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Jim| Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And thats a grand total of...  eleven dollars.
Dwight| You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.   Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Jim| ... MICHAEL!
Dwight| Oh, thats funny.  MICHAEL!
Pam|  Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Jim|  Absolutely.  I couldnt be more sorry about this.
Phyllis|  I know, I know.  Were all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Stanley|  I am upset.  Dont I sound upset?
Michael|  It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, were going to recalling all of that paper.
Michael| We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  Ive never been a fan.
Michael| Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Dwight| Cri-Man-Squa?
Michael| Crisis Management Squad.
Ryan| F and C, doubletime?
Michael| Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
Jim| One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Michael| To save time, Jim.
Karen| Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Pam| Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
Michael| You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Creed| Here.
Michael| Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
Creed| Every week Im supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
Michael| We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
Oscar| Thats really not our job.
Michael|
Midnight, Oscar!|  Dont worry, Kelly will be training you first.
Angela| Kellys training us?
Kelly| This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
day| is bananas!  B-A-N-A-
Angela|  I dont have a headache.  Im just preparing.
Michael| Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
Jim| Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Michael| No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
Jim| All right.
Michael| I want you to bring a partner.
Ryan| Ill go.
Michael| No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone whos actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
Andy|  William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
Jim| Yeah, Im definitely gonna go alone.
Michael| No, no.  I need two men on this.  Thats what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Dwight| Yes!  You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
Pam| Were having a press conference?
Michael| No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Dwight| Not!
Michael| Heres the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  Thats what happened to O.J.
Michael| I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Jim| Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Michael|
Here| is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client.  Some companies still know how business is done."  Okay?  Battle stations everybody, lets go, go, go, go, go, go!
Creed| Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasnt there.  And Im trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasnt there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
Creed| The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
Kelly| Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because youre not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.
Oscar| I wonder how many phone calls youre missing while youre teaching us to answer calls.
Kelly| I know, right?  Probably a lot.
Angela| Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Kelly| OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!"  Except dont say "Kelly," say your own name.  Or if youre bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones,  and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Kevin| Oh! Can I be  Australian, mate?
Kelly|  Absolutely!
Kevin|  ello, mate!
Kelly|  I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
Kevin|  I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Andy| Beer me!
Jim| Whats that?
Andy| Hand me that water.  I always say "Beer me."  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So hows whats-her-name?
Jim| You know her name.
Andy| Who, Karen?  Yeah, shes only one of my oldest friends.   Mmm.  Hows the apartment hangin?
Jim| Its fine.
Andy| Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
Jim| What about music?  Do you have any music?
Andy| Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.   Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
Jim| I was thinkin about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Andy| Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Jim| Lord, beer me strength.
Andy| So, Tuna.  When we get in there, lets do a really good job, okay?
Jim| Did that
really| need to be said?
Andy| Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes its just about the music of the conversation.
Andy| Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Jim| Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Andy| No, shes a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
Jim| Which one... is she?
Andy| The one in the green hoodie.
Jim| Wow.
Andy| I wonder if shes, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
Jim| No, I dont think so.
Andy| Shes like, probably a tutor.
Jim| Nope.
Andy| She probably a t--
Jim| No.
Andy| Sh---
Jim| No.
Michael| OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Dwight| On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Dwight| First rule in road-side beet sales Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now."  Those are the money beets.
Dwight|   Hey!   Look sharp!   Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
Chad Lite| Hi, uh---
Dwight| And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Chad Lite| Scranton Times.  Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life."
Dwight| And "Breaking Corporate News."
Chad Lite| And obits.
Dwight| Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  Youve been granted level three security clearance.
Chad Lite| Oh...
Dwight| Dont get too excited, thats out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Chad Lite| Uh, yeah, Id like uh, uh---
Dwight|  Great.
Jim| Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We dont have a
lot| of time, so we should probably...
Andy| Jamie!
Jim| Andy--- Ohh...
Andy| What are you doing here?
Jamie| Andy?
Andy| Are you a student here?
Jamie| Oh... yeah...
Andy| You never told me you were in high-school!
Jamie| This is weird.  I... gotta go to Spanish.
Andy| OH MY GOD!
Jim| Oh my God.
Andy| I had no idea.
Jim| Well... thats not gonna hold up in court.
Andy| Huh... We didnt do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
Kevin|  Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  Im sorry.  No, I am
so| sorry.
Oscar|  Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
Angela|  Excuse me?  Well, I dont see how thats our fault.  And Ive already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I dont know what you want from me.
Kelly| OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
sooo| good.  Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?
Creed| When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Dwight| Emergency dentist appointment.
Creed| Now Im told she told her manager she had the flu.  Im a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
Pam| Yes, Ill be sure someone returns your call.  Im so sorry.  Bye.
Barbara| Hello, Im looking for Michael Scott.
Michael| Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though shes a pretty unimportant client, really.
Michael| And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
Dwight|  You look good in this.
Michael| So, let us consider this matter ended.
Barbara| Well it isnt ended.  Im... Im very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
Michael| I know, I know youre angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
Barbara| I dont accept your apology.  The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
Michael| Well, we are extremely sorry.
Barbara| I dont accept.
School Official| Ill be with you in a moment.
Jim| All right.
Andy| Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Jim| Not important.  Because youre not dating her.  Because its a felony.
Andy| But who
was| that guy?
Jim|
Probably| another high-school student.
School Official| The issue with the watermark is very serious.
Jim| Absolutely.
School Official| We teach our students that character counts.
Jim| And you should.
School Official| But---
Andy|  Pfft.  You dont teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
bitch|.
Jim| Andy... is having a
real| rough day today.
Andy| I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
Jim| "Good luck."
Andy| Thats not what I had in mind.
Kelly| Ask where hes from.
Angela|  Where are you from?  Ohio?  Thats nice.  So what do you want?   Hes upset about the watermark.
Kelly| OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and were doing everything we can do to fix it, and that youre sorry.
Angela|  It was an unfortunate error.
Were fixing it.|  And you already got your money back...
Kelly| And youre sorry.
Angela| ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not.   I think he had Tourettes or something!
Michael| We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
Barbara| Well, it--- it doesnt help, because it already happened to me.
Michael| The watermark... its a one time thing.
Barbara| I dont care!  It was disgusting.  Cartoon characters having sex?
Dwight| May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Michael| OK...
Dwight| I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Michael| What... can I do, for you?
Barbara| I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
Michael| Well...  OK, well...  Um, wasnt really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
Barbara| Youre the head---
Michael| The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Barbara| Youre the head of the company!
Michael|
Im| the head of the company?!
Barbara| Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
Michael| No, Im a regional manager---
Barbara| And so you should lose your job!
Michael| No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
Barbara| Fine.
Michael| Thats insane.  Well give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Barbara| Mm-hmm.
Dwight| Its non-transferable...
Michael| Doesnt matter.  Out please!
Barbara| Im calling the Better Business Bureau.
Michael| Yeah, well Im calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?
Chad Lite| Everything.
Michael| We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
Pam| Its just the Scranton Times...
Michael| No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
Pam| You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Michael| Youre right.  It will blow over.  But its not... going to take... a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?
Pam| Yes.
Pam| Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a womans touch.
Michael|  OK, I think thats good.
Michael| "Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."
Dwight| Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Michael| Thats how devoted I am to this job.
Dwight| Im just saying...
Michael| I know.
Dwight| They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
Michael| I understand that, Dwight.
Dwight| You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Michael| Do you think youre taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now were wasting tape.  Im gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Dwight| Cut.
Michael| So Ill know where---
Pam| Cut.
Michael| Im asking Pam to do it, please.
Pam| Cut.
Michael| OK, ready?
Angela| Kevin, whats four plus seven?
Kevin|  Eleven.
Angela| Yeah, well you didnt know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Kevin| Yeah, well at least I didnt suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Oscar|  Yes.
Angela| You two are apes.
Oscar| I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Angela| Im sorry... that youre both morons.
Kevin| Oh, but you still said "Im sorry."
Angela| I called you morons.
Kevin| Still said it.
Oscar| Still said it, so...
Michael| Five, four, three.  "There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldnt be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Lets not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasnt me.  Theyre trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day."
Pam| One day for what?
Michael| Thats... they always give an ultimatum.
Pam| OK.
Michael| Good, cut?
Pam| Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Michael| Thought so too.
Creed|  Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe youd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  Shes got some children.
Creed| I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought Id pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  Its tragic.  Just tragic.
Jim| You want music?
Andy| I dont care.
Jim| Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think youll be all right.
Andy| Yeah.
Jim|  A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy| You know what--- I dont---
Jim| A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy|  Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim| A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy| Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim| A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy| Sweet.
Dwight|  Pam.
Pam| Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
Dwight|  Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Karen| Hey, Dwight, lookin sharp.
Dwight| Yeah, thats cause Im... youre boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause youre my girlfriend?
Jim| Do you?
Karen| No.
Jim| OK.
Karen| Im good.  Thanks.
Jim|  Look at that.
Dwight| Im Jim Halpert.
Jim| Spot on.
Dwight| Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
