Jim|  Hey.
Jim|  Oh, whats this?
Dwight| That is a demerit.
Jim|  "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.
Dwight| Youve gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Jim| Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Dwight|  Lets put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Jim| Lay it on me.
Dwight| Three demerits and youll receive a citation.
Jim| Now that sounds serious.
Dwight| Oh, it is serious. Five citations and youre looking at a violation. Four of those and youll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and youre looking at a written warning. Two of those, thatll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Jim| Which would be me.
Dwight| That is correct.
Jim| OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Dwight| Whats a dis... whats that?
Jim| Oh, you dont want to know.
Pam|  Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
Phyllis| I think I just got flashed.
Pam| What? Really?
Phyllis| In the parking lot.
Pam| Oh, my God.
Dwight|  Move!
Jim| OK, Ill call the
real| police.
Andy| What happened? What can I do to help?
Jim|  OK.
Andy| Ill check the web.
Jim|  Thank you.  The police are on it. They say theyve already had three calls.
Pam|  Can you tell us what happened?
Phyllis| Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
Angela| Phyllis. Youre a married woman.
Creed| The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, whats all the fuss?
Creed| If thats flashing, then lock me up.
Pam|  Its just, like, so creepy.
Ryan|  Yeah.
Michael| Whats happening?
Pam| Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Michael| Really? Is she OK?
Pam| Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Michael| OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.
Angela| What is so funny?
Michael| Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Kevin| Im guessing not.
Michael|  Im sorry. Its pretty funny when you think about it.
Jim| Mm... not really, no.
Pam| Its disgusting and demeaning.
Michael| Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  Hes back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!
Toby| Hey, whats going on? Theres a police car in the...
Michael| What? Oh.
Toby| Whats going on?
Michael| Oh, Phyllis got flashed. Its, uh...
Toby| I dont think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Michael| Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but shes not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Toby| I dont think the women in this office -
Michael| Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe youre the flasher.
Toby| I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Michael| Uh-huh. Prove it. Lets see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Michael| In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women cant have fun if they dont feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didnt hear me.
Jan|  Michael, ...
Michael| Huh?
Jan| ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Michael| I dont know. I feel... I drive a lot. Im spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Jan| Ill give you $200. And if I get up before you, Ill leave it on the dresser.
Michael| Um, that... I dont know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Jan| $300?
Michael| I... uh, well, I dont know.
Jan| You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if youre coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Hunter|  You got it, Jan.
Dwight| Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Michael|  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that cant happen. Not in my house.
Dwight| Agreed. Let me show you what Ive been working on.
Michael| OK.
Dwight|  There are several penises there Id love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Michael| This is the last
thing| that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.
Dwight| Look at that one.
Michael| Dwight, are those your pants? Thats a Polaroid.
Michael| Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
Dwight| Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what Im referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Jim|  Question. Wont that interfere with your other task forces?
Dwight| Answer No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what youre thinking.  Wont that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why dont you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Pam| Phallus?
Dwight| Phyllis, sorry. Ive got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Pam| I dont often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Phyllis| I didnt really get a good look.
Pam| Thats OK. I dont feel like answering phones.
Karen| Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out?  "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous.
Dwight| Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Karen| Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Dwight| Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Pam|  "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.
Michael| OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why dont you just take these women, put em in a burlap sack, and hit em with a stick? Because thats what youre doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Karen| Look, its really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Michael| See? Thats what were talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
Dwight| Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Michael| No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? Thats it. Conference room, five minutes. Womens appreciation.
Jim| Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Michael| Oh, I dont know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
Dwight|  Mm, less than three.
Michael| That is not current.
Dwight| You know what? Why doesnt Oscar run the meeting? Hes a homosexual.
Jim| Why dont you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Dwight| Those are collectible action figures and theyre worth more than your car.
Michael| You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Michael| I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Creed| Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Michael| Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Meredith| I dont remember doing that.
Angela| What a surprise.
Michael| OK, no catfights. Please. Lets - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Dwight|
Alien|. Blagh!
Michael| What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones arent really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesnt care. Society sucks. I dont even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Andy| If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Kevin| Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Karen| What youre saying is extremely misogynistic.
Michael| Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Karen| Im saying that youre being sexist.
Michael| No. Im being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Karen| That - its the same thing.
Phyllis| Michael.
Michael| Yes.
Phyllis| When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Michael| Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Angela| And when we get mad, you always ask us if were on our periods.
Michael| I have to know whether youre serious or not.
Dwight| I wish I could menstruate.
Dwight| If I could menstruate, I wouldnt have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. Id just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, Id be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Karen| Can we just get back to work?
Michael| Ye - OK, yes.
Angela| This is not work talk.
Michael| Youre right. Youre right, youre right. And you know why? Its because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where were gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
Karen| Frankly, its kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Angela| Malls are just awful and humiliating. Theyre just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a juniors section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids size 10.
Michael| OK, lets go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Lets go!
Dwight| Have you finished with the sketch?
Pam| Yeah.
Dwight| Hmm, doesnt seem like the type.
Pam| Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Dwight| Hmm.
Dwight|  I plan on plastering this perverts face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Pam|  Oh.
Angela| Meredith, slow down! Were not gonna get there any faster if were dead.
Meredith| Thanks. I know how to drive.
Pam| Oh, yeah. You really shouldnt litter.
Meredith| My car, my rules.
Kevin| Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the womens bathroom?
Jim| No. Thank you, though.
Kevin| You arent curious?
Jim| Not really. Ive seen a bathroom before.
Kevin| Yeah, but... its every guys fantasy.
Jim| I think you mean a girls
locker| room. And in the fantasy, theres usually girls in it.
Kevin|  Yeah. Im going in.
Jim| Go crazy.
Kevin|  Oh... my... God.
Andy| I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Dwight| Of course you do, moon face. Thats because youre a preppy freak, youre the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Andy| This guy looks like a real deviant.
Dwight| No, duh. Thats why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Andy| Aye, aye, Capn.
Dwight| More like, "Aye, aye, General."
Michael|  I dont think shes gonna make it. Dont think shes gonna make it -
Meredith| Its a little too tight. Im gonna find another spot.
Michael| Many women
are| competent drivers.  OK. Come on.
Dwight|  This is what we
know|.
Jim|  Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Kevin| Yes.
Toby| Hey, uh... whered you decide to take Karen tonight?
Jim| Anna Marias.
Ryan| Whats the occasion?
Jim| Six-month anniversary. What?
Ryan| Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Jim| No, weve been dating for six months.
Ryan| Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Jim| Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said shes not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Ryan| I figured. Its cool. I dont - I wouldnt want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Michael| All right. Hope nobodys on a diet.
Kelly| Thanks, Michael.
Angela| Thank you, Michael.
Michael| Youre welcome. Youre welcome, youre welcome. OK. So, lets dish.
Pam| What do you want to dish about?
Michael| Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
Pam| OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Kelly| Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Michael| What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Phyllis| Oh, it can be fun.
Michael| Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
Karen| Its a pretty common one.
Michael| I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Angela| OK. Im gonna be at the doll store.
Angela| Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So Im forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Pam| Michael, you shouldnt do anything that youre uncomfortable with.
Michael| Jan says anything that doesnt scare us is not worth doing. I dont know. Maybe were different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Pam| Oh, my God.
Michael|  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Karen| That is not healthy behavior.
Michael| No, its not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
Pam| Michael, you need to get out of this.
Michael| No, shes... shes fooling around. Its a woman thing.
Pam| No, normal women dont do stuff like that. This is bad.
Michael| No... No, its all right. Im OK. Im OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?
Pam| Read the pros first.
Michael| OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Phyllis| She does have very nice clothes.
Karen| OK, OK. Um, cons.
Michael| Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. Im unhappy when Im with her. Flat-chested.
Pam| What was the last one?
Michael| Shes totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Phyllis| No, the one before that.
Michael| Im unhappy when Im with her.
Pam| Michael... you shouldnt be with someone who doesnt make you happy.
Michael| Im happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Karen| Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Michael| Yeah, thats smart.
Pam| Maybe. But it sounds like youre just wrong for each other.
Michael| That sounds good too. I dont know whos right. I just dont - I dont know. I dont know.
Phyllis| I bet you know. Dont think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Michael| I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Phyllis| My mom taught me that.
Michael| Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Pam| No one said it has no calories.
Michael| Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.
Michael| Lets face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. Theyre caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Kevin|  This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Toby| I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Creed| What are you doing in here? This is the womens room.
Kevin| Youre in here.
Creed| I pay for that privilege.
Kevin|  OK.
Creed|  Im a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the womens room for number two. Ive been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Michael| Mm. You dont want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Karen| Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Phyllis| Jims gonna love it.
Pam| Im kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I dont need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Angela|  Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up.
Michael| Oh. Oh, no.   Its Jan. What do I do?
Karen| Answer it.
Pam| Dont answer it.
Michael| OK, it stopped.
Kelly|  Whoa.
Meredith|  Crap.
Jim|  That is pretty cool.
Kelly| Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Michael| Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Pam| Here, uh... Meredith? Why dont you put your hazards on.
Michael| Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Lets see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.
Pam| I think Ive got it.
Michael| Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Pam| I dont think we really need that, Michael.
Michael| Uh... you know what? Im going to... you take care of that. Im gonna do traffic... detail.
Pam| You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobes already coming in handy.  Coming!
Andy| Think well find him?
Dwight| Yeah, I do. Cause justice never rests.
Andy|  Halvsies?
Dwight| No. Wholesies.
Andy| Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Dwight| Natch.
Andy| Yep. If you dont mind, I think Ill hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Dwight| You know, I may have underestimated you. Youre not a total ass.
Michael| OK, I am really going to do this.
Pam| Good luck, Michael.
Michael| You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Lets do this. Lets do it.
Karen| OK, remember, be strong.
Michael| I love you guys.  Now Im getting her voicemail.
Pam| Dont leave a -
Michael|  Hey, Jan. Its me, Michael. Im just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so Ill talk to you later.
Jan| Michael...  I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldnt stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So...  Im sorry.
Michael| Thank you.
Jan| So... were good?
Michael| Abso-fruit-ly.
Jan|  Oh. Hold on, Im sorry.
Michael| No... No...
Jan| One second. Oh! Its from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
Michael| Yeah.
Jan| OK.  "Its me, Michael. Im just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..."
Michael| Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you. OK, buddy."
Jan| Oh.
Michael|  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Theres a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Dwight|  Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Jim| Hey, Dwight. Its Jim.
Dwight| Jim, what are you doing? Im busy.
Jim| No, youre not. Im looking right at you.
Dwight| Ugh. Im hanging up.
Jim| Dont.  I have information about the sex predator.
Dwight| You have information about the sex predator?
Jim| I saw him two minutes ago.
Dwight| Where?
Jim| In the womens bathroom, above the sink.
Dwight|  Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm.  PAM!
