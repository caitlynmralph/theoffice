Andy| Good morning, Pam.
Pam| Oh, welcome back, Andy.
Andy| Drew.  Im Drew now.
Pam| Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
Andy| Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasnt even necessary in the first place.
Andy| Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident.  But after five weeks in Anger Management, Im back.  And Ive got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
Andy| Mornin Jim.
Jim| Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
Andy| Good.  Drew.
Jim| Whats that?
Andy| Dr--- You can call me Drew.
Jim| No, Im not gonna call you that.
Andy| Cool.  I cant control what you do.  I can only control what
I| do.
Jim| Andy.
Andy| Drew.  Dwight.  Hows it goin man?
Dwight| Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which Im looking forward to.  Its an Amish technique.  Its like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Dwight| Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Jim| Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Dwight| Ok, tell him thats not true.
Jim| Dwight says that he actually doesnt know one single fact about bear attacks.
Andy| You guys...
Dwight| Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Jim|  Andy!  Nah, thats too far.
Dwight| Damn you.
Michael| Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryls presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Darryl| Now, this is the forklift.  You need---  You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
cant| drive it. ... Quiz!  Mike.
Michael| Hmm.
Darryl| Should you drive the forklift?
Michael| I can, and I have.
Darryl| No! No no no no no!  I said
should| you.  You should not drive it.  You should not drive the forklift, you understand?
Lonny| Youre not allowed to drive the forklift.
Darryl| Its not safe, you dont have a license.
Michael| Guys, Im not the only one whos driven the forklift.   Pudge has driven the forklift.
Madge| Madge.
Michael| I thought your name was Pudge?
Madge| No, its always been Madge.
Michael| Okay.  Um, her.
Darryl|  Her.  Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Michael| Ah, fine.
Darryl| Do you understand that?
Michael| Yeeesh.
Darryl| We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... Weve never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Michael|  "Hey Darryl, hows it hangin?!"
Darryl| And I fell and busted my ankle.  Im legitimately scared for my workers.
Darryl| The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Dwight| Yeah!
Andy| Its on!
Darryl| How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Michael| Bailer?  I hardly know her.
Lonny| Dammit, Michael.  Pay attention, man.
Darryl| Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Kevin| Five bucks says its over 50.
Jim| You really wanna bet?
Darryl| Anybody?
Kevin| Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Guy| How many?
Jim| Ok, youre on.
Darryl| Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Kevin|  Damn...
Darryl|  You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Jim| No, dont worry about it.  Well just got double or nothin.
Kevin| On what?
Jim| I dont know, well figure somethin out.
Kevin| Nice.
Oscar| What are you guys talkin about?
Darryl| These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Michael|, should not go anywhere near them.
Michael| Yes, yes.  But it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Darry| It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Lonny| What the
hell| is wrong with this man?
Michael| Its a big red trash compactor!
Lonny| What are you---
Darryl| Its not a trash compactor!  Its a baler!
Lonny| Dont disrespect the baler!
Michael| Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
Darryl| No do not touch it!
Michael| ...would I go near---
Darryl| There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Michael| Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Toby| Ok, um, one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  Its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Michael| Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Toby| Um, yeah.  Youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, its also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Michael| Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  Thats like... a half an hour, every hour?
Darryl| Take them at the same time.
Michael| Ok, you know what?  Youre making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Toby| No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
Ryan| What about a long sleeve T?
Toby| Well, thatll work.
Kevin| Long johns?  A shaw?
Toby| You know, anything that warms you.
Michael| Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.    Sorry, he is very lame.   Um, lets see.  "Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
Darryl| Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Lonny| Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, aint it?
Michael| Ok guys, you know what?  I didnt--- I didnt interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Darryl| Actually, you did.
Michael| Yes.  Okay, lets do another one.  This is a good one.  "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
Toby| Sedentary.
Michael| Yes.  "Which can contribute to heart disease."  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Lonny| Thats called having a fat butt, Michael.
Michael| Mmmm, no, no, its... sedentary...
Lonny| Yeah, yeah.  Thats, thats fat butt disease.  Thats what you suffer from?
Michael| No.
Lonny| Fat butt disease, Michael?
Kelly| Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Lonny| Yeah?  I bet youd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldnt you?
Kelly| Ryan?
Lonny| Dude, tell your girl to shut up.
Kelly| What?!
Ryan| Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Kelly| Are you kidding me?
Darryl| Alright, we outta here.
Michael| Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Lonny| Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.
Darryl| Thats what Ive been trying to tell you, Mike.  Its serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin on your biscuit.  Never havin to risk it.
Michael| Okay.  ... What, Nerf isnt cool anymore?
Michael| Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Mens Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  Id like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  "Hello, Im Michael.  Welcome to Mens Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example.
Kevin|  Ten.
Oscar| Really, ten?  Thats your guess?  Youre a professional accountant.
Jim| Theres like ten green ones.
Oscar| Forty-two.
Jim| Im gonna say fifty.
Karen| Fifty-one.
Jim| Oh, dont be that person.
Kevin| That is lame.
Karen| Its a strategy!
Pam| Its called being smart.
Karen| Thank you.
Kevin| Oh, geeze.
Pam| I dont know how the whole betting thing started, but its fun.
Pam| Ten...
Jim| Kevs out.
Kevin| Damn it.
Pam| 47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
Everyone| Oooh!
Kevin| That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
Hours| and
hours|.
Jim| Okay, okay.
Kevin| No, constantly.  Like, for
years|.
Jim| Okay.
Michael| Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Pam| I dont understand the question.
Michael| Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
Pam| Yeah...
Michael| I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Pam| Its really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Michael| Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You dont go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
Pam| So, youre okay?
Michael| Indubitably.
Michael| They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Dwight| Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Michael| I dont know, I dont know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Dwight| Wolves.
Michael| Nn--- Depression.
Dwight| Visual aids.
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| A quilt.  Depression quilt?
Micheal| No time to sew a quilt.  ... I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
Michael| You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?"  Well, I thought Id bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Heres the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, were going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, wheres Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, "Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?"  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."  But thats... not why Im doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin-da!
Kelly| So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And lets just say that I just sent back
Love Actually|, which was awesome.   And they sent me
Uptown Girls|, which is also awesome.  But guess what, now I want to see love actually again,  but its at the bottom of the que!  Oh no, what do I do!?  What I do, is this.  I go online, I go click, click, click.  And I change the order of the que, so that I can see
Love Actually|  as soon as I want to.  Its so easy, Ryan.  Do you really not know how Netflix works?
Ryan| I guess I forgot.
Kelly| Youre such a ditz.
Kevin| Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
Dwight|  Okay, lets do this thing!  Ill go summon the troops!
Michael| Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Dwight| We measured it once...
Michael| Go buy some watermelons.
Dwight| Seedless?
Michael| Just...
Toby|  Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Pam| Hey Creed.
Creed| Hey!
Pam| Hey.
Creed| Hello.
Pam| Yes!
Kevin| Here you go.
Toby| Nice.
Karen| I dont know this place as well as I thought I did.  Im getting cleaned out.
Dwight| Ready?
Michael| Lets do it!  Drop that sucker.
Dwight|
Michael| BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Dwight| Okay.
Michael| Find out whose car that is.  If its Stanleys, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Dwight| Got it.
Michael| Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Dwight| Were not allowed to use the baler.
Michael| Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Dwight| Im on it!
Dwight| Im temporarily lifting the shun.
Andy| Thank you.
Dwight| It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Andy| Anything.
Dwight| Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Andy| You mean a moon bounce.
Dwight| What do you think?  Youve got an hour.
Andy| Im gonna need... Im gonna need petty cash.
Dwight| Shunning resumed.
Andy| Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
Dwight| Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Dwight| Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Michael| Yes, thank you for seeing that.
Dwight| When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Michael| I dont know if I wanna do this.
Dwight| Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Michael| No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, were not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Dwight| Thats right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  Its rock n roll!
Michael| Rock n roll!
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| Thats right!  I am not thinking.
Dwight|  Near near near near near!
Michael| Yes!  Yeah!
Dwight|  Michael is awesome!  Jumpin off the roof!
Michael| Woo!
Dwight|  Bouncin on the bouncy bounce!  Show em whos boss!
Michael| Woo!
Dwight|  Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Michael| I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point!
Dwight|  Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Andy| Whoa!  Whats the situation?
Dwight|  Un-shun.  I think hes suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Andy| Ok, whens the shunning thing gonna end?
Dwight| Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Stanley| Is it nice outside?
Dwight| Its gorgeous.  Lets go!
Stanley| Do I need my jacket?
Dwight| No really, its, its very nice.  Come on!
Ryan| Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Dwight| Everybodys gonna be fine in exactly what theyre wearing, lets go!  Lets go!
Dwight|  Come on, hurry up you guys!
Michael|  My life!  Oh, my life...
Dwight|  Michael, whats wrong?!
Michael| Everythings wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight| Depression?  Isnt that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael| Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Dwight| Is that the last year the data was available?
Michael| Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Dwight| Dont do anything rash!
Michael| Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Dwight| I didnt...  I didnt think you needed them for this part.
Michael| Okay... thats...
Dwight| you said to just...
Michael| Thats the whole point, dummy.
Dwight| Okay, Im on it!
Michael| Okay.
Dwight| Attention blue collar workers!
Pam| What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Jim| Id say like... 10,000 to 1?
Kevin| Okay, Id like ten bucks on those odds.
Kevin| If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
very| rich dude.
Dwight| Michaels up on the roof and hes acting strange!
Michael| Oooooh, my life!
Dwight| Michael!  Whats wrong?
Michael| Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Dwight| Depressed?  Isnt that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael| Dwight, you ignorant slut.
Jim| Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Michael| And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Jim| Oh, excuse me.  Its my... favorite part.
Angela| This is just offensive.
Ryan| At least were outside.
Creed|  Hey, check it out, theres a... theres a castle over there.
Jim| Oh my God, there
is| a castle.
Dwight| No, theres nothing to see over there, people!  Theres nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Michael| Damn it.
Pam| Oh... God.  Oh my God, hes gonna jump.
Jim| Oh.  Hes going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Pam| Yeah...
Jim| Hey uh, Michael.  Dont jump on the bouncy castle.  You cant do that, because youre going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Pam| Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Michael| What is it?
Pam| Come down and... open it and youll see.
Michael| Dwight, find out what the present is.
Dwight| Okay, uh... I dont see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Jim| Dwight...
Pam| Dwight, what are you---
Dwight| Oh... Its uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, theyre only available in Japan.
Michael| Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Darryl| Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, youre gonna serious hurt yourself.
Michael| You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Darryl| Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Michael| What do I have to live for?
Darryl| A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  Its goin good, right?
Michael| Its complicated with Jan.  And I dont know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isnt nearly as good as it used to be.
Darryl| Mike, youre a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
be| you.  To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.
Michael| Do you really mean that?
Darryl| I couldnt do it. I--- I aint that strong.  And I aint that brave.
Michael| Im braver than you?
Darryl|
Way| braver!  You Braveheart, man.
Michael| I Braveheart.  I am.
Darryl| Come down, okay?
Michael| Okay.  Pam, Im coming down to get my present.
Michael| An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  Thats the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really cant say.  But, yes.
