Michael| Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
Kids| YAY!
Michael| Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Dont worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
Jim| We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Michael| I am going to scare these kids so bad.
Darryl| This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You dont believe me? Just take a look.  Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Angela| Black widow.
Kelly| Lulu from The Fifth Element.
Darryl| Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
Creed| I want to sell your blood!
Ryan| Thats really not the trend in vampires right now.
Darryl| Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Meredith| Im a hobo.
Darryl| I asked for a list.  ...and a clown.
Dwight| Im Jigsaw, idiot.
Darryl| Youre not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Jim| Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Darryl| Ok, kids. Youve all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Kids| Yeah! 
Michael| Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
Michael| Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
Michael| It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Darryl| What the hell is wrong with you?
Michael| Who wants candy?
Michael| ...and then I think Im going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Jim| Wow.
Michael| Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
Jim| I bet we would.
Michael| They have a TCBY booth.
Jim| Cool.
Michael| The same stuff you get downtown.
Jim| Mmm-hmm.
Michael| Do you like TCBY?
Jim| Who doesnt?
Michael| I cant believe its- I cant believe its yogurt. Uh... itll be fun
Erin| I confirmed with Raskin Design and theyre expecting the both of you in an hour.
Jim| Oh. Actually, its just gonna be me.
Erin| They said the both of you.
Jim| That is a mistake.
Michael| You should give them a call. Check that out.
Jim| Alright. Lets clear this up.  Well, theres actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Michael| Jims a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
Jim| Great. See ya then.
Michael| Wha- what?
Jim| They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Michael| Why dont they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I dont understand.
Jim| I absolutely dont understand, either.
Michael| I dont want you to feel like Im baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
Jim| Alright.
Michael| Let me get your stroller.
Jim| Sure. Michaels a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. Thats what a teacher is, right?
Michael| What are you gonna call him?
Jim| Dave.
Michael| No. What is his name?
Jim| Dave.
Michael| Mr. Bourchard. Theyre very formal.
Jim| Yeah. Ive spoken to them on the phone.
Michael| Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
Jim| Yes, it is.
Michael| ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
Jim| No thanks.
Michael| They are into style.
Jim| Mmm-hmm.
Michael| They are into appearance. We are selling success.
Jim| ...and paper.
Michael| Thats sorta secondary. 
Jim| Nope. No.
Jim| Hes trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Pam| Here we are outside-
Andy| WB!
Pam| - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
Andy| Industrial P.! Makin cold calls.
Pam| The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Andy|  Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Pam| Here it is.  Suite 401.
Andy| Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
Pam| I know. Now you dont have to.
Andy| Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401.
Michael| Alright. Hi. Any messages?
Erin| Youre soaking wet.
Michael| Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
Phyllis| Wow. Sounds scary.
Michael| It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasnt.
Angela| Why isnt Jim wet?
Jim| I outran it.
Meredith| I dont think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Michael| It rained.
Dwight| Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Michael| Nothing. Cocoa.
Jim| Ill just leave that suit in your office then.
Michael| Good. Yep.
Secretary| Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.
Andy| Were kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. 
Secretary| How exciting! Do you guys know the sex yet?
Pam|  Oh. No, no.  Were not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
Andy|  Looks like somebodys got a case of the definitelies.
Erin|  Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Michael| Ok. Thank you.
Stanley| Did you say Koi pond?
Michael|  Yeah?
Erin| Michael, people are asking questions.
Michael| Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, whats going on?
Phyllis| Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Michael| Uh... I cant really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Oscar| Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Jim| Mmm... its like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Michael| It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
Angela| So you fell in?
Michael| No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
Angela| So a child had fallen in?
Michael| Not yet!
Kevin| That is hilarious. 
Michael| No it is- dont! Im not gonna bump. Im not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. 
Jim| Truthfully, it wasnt the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Pam| And wed like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Customer| Well that sounds like a really nice deal.
Andy| Sha-bow.
Customer| And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too.
Andy| Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
Customer| My mistake. Sorry.
Pam| Its ok.
Andy| Nuh. Actually, its kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
Customer| That- thats good for you.
Pam| Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Andy| Pams carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesnt matter what Pam looks like.
Pam| Yeah.
Pam| You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
Andy| No I wasnt. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Pam| You blew the sale, you idiot.
Andy| Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Michael| Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
Erin| Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called.
Michael| Oh. He did? What did he say?
Erin| He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didnt mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
Michael| Ok.
Kevin|  Im gonna kill you.
Stanley| Michael, dont listen to them.
Michael| Thank you, Stanley.
Stanley| You just ignore their carp.
Michael| Ok.
Dwight| Michael?
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. Theyre mocking you with wordplay.
Creed| Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
Michael| I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
Oscar| Dont you mean Koi Story?
Phyllis| And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Dwight| Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Michael| I know what a flounder is.
Michael| Im not usually the butt of the joke. Im usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and hed have to put on my suit and itd be too short and hed look... Damn it! Hed still look good.
Michael| The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been Koi-ponded? Who heres been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
Phyllis| Michael, you make fun of us every day.
Michael| Uh... 
Kevin| Yeah. Every single day.
Michael| You never said anything.
Meredith| Uh, we have. Countless times.
Michael| Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, Stop because I want you to stop or STOP as in Stop. Youre making me laugh so hard. What youre doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!
Angela| Thats never the case.
Michael| We are going to make a Do Not Mock list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? Im gonna kick it off. Lets see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Dwight| I dont want people making fun of my nose.
Michael| Your nose?
Dwight| Its too small.
Michael| Alright.
Oscar| Oh my. That is small.
Dwight| Just, write it down, please.
Oscar| Can you breathe okay?
Kelly| What keeps your glasses on?
Dwight| Hey! Its on the list, everybody.
Michael| No. I havent finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? Thats it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybodys getting their chance.
Kevin| I dont want people making fun of my weight.
Michael| Ok. Thats to broad. Its gotta be something else. How bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
Meredith| I dont want to say it out loud.
Michael| Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And dont sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Meredith| I really didnt want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? 
Michael| Ok.
Andy| That is our sales pitch and we are stickin to it. 
Keena Gifford| Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.
Andy| Well- 
Pam| Oh-  Thank you.
Keena Gifford| Some couples dont seem like a good match. You two do.
Pam| Well, you know.
Andy| Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- 
Pam| He loves to eat.
Andy| I love to dance- 
Pam| I love to watch him dance.
Andy| Right. Sometimes Ill just dance for hours in the living room- 
Pam| And Ill just watch him.
Keena Gifford| And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.
Pam| Yes.
Andy| Yeah. We are thrilled.
Pam| Mmm-hmm.
Andy| In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasnt that fun, honey?
Pam| It was, sweetie.
Keena Gifford| Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.
Andy| Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
Keena Gifford| Yeah!
Andy| Yeah.
Angela| This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Phyllis| So now youre comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Erin| Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. 
Michael| Its a fish.
Erin| They want you to pay for it.
Michael| It couldve died of natural causes. So... 
Erin| Well, they said you stepped on its head. He did not suffer.
Oscar| When is the funeral?
Michael| Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
Erin| $300.
Michael| What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. 
Creed| Oh, youre payin way too much for your worms, man. Whos your worm guy?
Jim| Ok. Great meeting, everybody. Thats it.
Michael| No, no.
Dwight| Thank you. 
Michael| No. We are not done here. This- 
Andy| One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
Keena Gifford| Thats great!
Andy| Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
Pam| Yeah, well, thatll happen.
Andy| Oh, my gosh. Its like hes trying to say, I love you, too, Daddy. I love you, too. 
Pam| Sometimes were so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
Andy| Message received, little soy bean.
Jim| I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
Michael| No, Jim. You dont understand. Things like this dont just die. Kids in high school still call me Ponytail. 
Jim| No, they dont.
Michael| Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
Jim| Maybe if you make fun of yourself itll all go away.
Michael| I want to make fun of you right now.
Jim| Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Michael| No. Dont do that. Youre not. Youre not stupid.
Jim| See?
Michael| Oh, my God.
Michael| Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
Phyllis| Michael. You know, when you think about it, its not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Michael| Well, you know what? Youre right, Phyllis, but Ive been there before. Ive seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. Thats the problem.
Dwight| Michael, please. Stop it now. Youre embarrassing yourself.
Michael| Its ok. Were having fun. Its not actually the first time Ive been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, Who are your 5 friends? and Im, like, Uh...  I didnt even know I couldnt even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I dont even have Jans cell phone number and I hate her! She wont give it to me. I was like, Oh, I guess Im a loser. A luh-whooooo a za her.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
Kevin|  Enjoying your nut?
Oscar| Kevin.
Angela| Why?
Kevin| Im not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Angela| I was.
Michael| Hey. Who wants to watch Michaels pond dive? My roommates friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and hes bringing it over.
Jim| Mm... Im, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and youre gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so... 
Kevin| Well stay late.
Andy| Well, that went pretty well.
Pam| Yeah, I guess.
Andy| We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, Id say we nailed it.
Pam| If Im being completely honest, I couldve done without the belly kiss.
Andy| You know what? Im sorry. Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Pam| Yeah. Way too much.
Andy| Yeah.
Pam| I mean, what the hell was that?
Andy| What the heck was that?
Pam| When you cried?
Andy| Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Pam| Youre fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
Andy| No. I know Im gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I dont know. It was fun to role play, right?
Pam| Hmm.
Andy| I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, Im so sick of being single.
Pam| Well, are you dating anyone?
Andy| What do you think of Erin? I mean- shes- I- Shes kinda cool.
Pam| Ah.
Andy| You think I can do better?
Pam| Ah.
Andy| Gotta get my goin out on.
Meredith| Hey, lets watch this thing.
Jim| Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. Were not watchin this.
Oscar| How can we not watch this?
Jim| What happened to Do Not Mock?
Phyllis| Were not mocking, were watching.
Jim| That will inevitably lead to mocking. So... 
Phyllis| Well, well deal with it as it comes.
Michael| Is this the tape of me falling?
Phyllis| Yes. Put the DVD in.
Kevin| Open QuickTime.
Oscar| It starts on its own. Let it - 
Kevin| No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. Ive done this.
Jim| Guys. Michael cant handle this and as your boss Im saying were not watching it.
Michael| No. Its ok. Watch it. He cant fire all of you.
Jim| What are you doing?
Michael| Its alright. I can handle it.
Jim| No.
Michael| I am a grown-up, Jim.
Meredith| Shh. Its on.
Kevin| Here they come.  Boom!
Oscar| Oh. Did - did you see that?
Jim| See what?
Angela| Whyd you stop it?
Jim| Oscar, yes. Youre right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Oscar| Jim, you let Michael fall in.
Dwight| Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Jim| Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Michael| I dont think you froze.
Jim| Its a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?
Angela| No.
Jim| I didnt ask you.  Would you like to talk? 
Dwight| Judas.
Dwight| Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
Jim| I shouldve grabbed you. Im sorry. Look, I thought I couldve done todays sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Michael| Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Meredith|  Hey, whats up lifeguard?
Oscar| Jim, I think Im in your way. 
Michael| Oscars a douche.
Jim|  Hes alright.
Michael| No. Hes a- yeah, hes alright. Ok. 
Jim| Thanks Michael.
Michael| Youre welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell. 
Pam| Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Erin| Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I dont accidentally read them.
Pam| Ok.
Erin| Thanks.
Pam| Mmm-hmm.
Erin| How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Pam| No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. Hes really cool.
Erin| Yeah, he is!
Pam| Yeah, he is.
Erin| Hes, like, the coolest person Ive ever met.
Pam| Thats... right. Hes like Marlon Brando.
Erin| Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? Cause he is.
Pam| I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
