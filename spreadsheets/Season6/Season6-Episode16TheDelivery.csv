Pam|   I just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, Im pregnant...  Great, well, Ill write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
Dwight|  Wait a minute!  You cant do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Jim|   Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  Im excited.  Oh, definitely.
Dwight|  No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Pam|  There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Dwight|    Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, its just horrific.  The  doctor says hed never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Dwight|  I need a baby.  Ill never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, Ive been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Pam|  Kevin, youre such a gourmand.
Kevin|  I cooked my way through Julia Childs cookbook, and now, Im halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edwards corn flake chicken.
Pam|  Hmm.
Kevin|  Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so weve been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Kevin|  I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Pam|  Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
Kevin|  I think it should be a surprise.
Meredith|    Oh, getting there, huh?
Pam|  No, no.  I still have time.
Pam|  Im having contractions, but theyre irregular and far apart.  So Im not really in labor, Im near labor.
Jim|  Yeah, were slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Pam|  If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Jim|  Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if its crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless its a boy.
Pam|  I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Pam|  Ooh.
Michael|  Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  Shes contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Jim|  Michael.
Michael|  Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Jim|  Michael, you shouldnt have done that.
Michael|  Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Pam|  You know the babys not going to live here, right?
Michael|  Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Jim|  Hmm, that logics air-tight, but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Michael|  Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I dont want to know.  Tell me later.  Lets go!  Lets go!  Hospital!
Pam|  Okay, okay, were not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Erin|  Ooh, spooky.  But why?
Jim|  Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Pam|  Everythings fine.  We have plenty of time.
Nick|  Well, you dont want to wait too long, Pam.  Otherwise the babys going to become a teenager in there and youll be up all night, from the rock music.
Michael|  Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Dont get revenge on me, nerd.
Angela|    What are you looking at?
Dwight|  Ha, nerd.
Kelly|  Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals dont work, and you can poop yourself.
Dwight|    Bare my child.
Angela|  Excuse me?
Dwight|  I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Lets meet at 400 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Jim|    Thats seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Pam|  Hold on, hold on.  It isnt midnight yet.
Jim|  Are you serious?  Pam.
Pam|  No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Jim|  I...  Pam, please.
Pam|  Im going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Andy|  Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your babys born tomorrow, hes going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Pam|  Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
Jim|  Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Pam|  Five minutes apart.
Jim|  So, the plan was seven minutes.  But were calling an audible, because thats her call.  Because shes the quarterback.  Im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Pam|  Okay, stop watching me.
Jim|  Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Pam|  Mm-hmm.
Jim|  Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, thats a big deal.  While were on the subject, why dont I just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check?
Pam|  Not until midnight.
Andy|  Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Dont get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Erin|  I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Andy|  My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Jim|  You know, its getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet.
Michael|  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You cant tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Jim|   Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals.
Pam|  Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I dont think Im going to make it until midnight if Im just sitting here thinking about it.
Michael|  Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Lets go!
Michael|  Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  
Michael|  The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body.
Andy|  Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Michael|  I will allow that.
Andy|  Yes!  Can anyone do those?
Stanley|  Im going to go look at the Internet.
Jim|    Oh!  Oh, alright.  Thats a good one.
Pam|  Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
Michael|  Okay.
Kelly|  Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Pam|  Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Michael|  Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Pam|  Yes, this is the only time Im ever going to make this request.
Michael|  Yes, Phyl?
Phyllis|  I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Michael|   Nope, nope, I dont think anybody wants to see that.
Andy|  I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Michael|    That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
Andy|  Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...    Youre clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so Im going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
Ryan|    "You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."
Erin|    Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Angela|  Good afternoon.
Dwight|  Have a seat.
Angela|  What is this?
Dwight|  Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Angela|  Of course.
Dwight|  Its been a long time since weve come down here separately.
Angela|  You know I was thinking...
Dwight|  Now, then.  Lets get to it, shall we?  Item one   Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
Angela|  Agreed.
Michael|    Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Kevin|  For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Jim|  Okay, you know what?  Im going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  Hed probably know...
Pam|  Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
Michael|  Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Lets have happy times.
Jim|  Alright.
Michael|  Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And Im thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Erin|  Um, stimulate the nipples.
Michael|  Okay, nobody touch Pams nipples.  Think of Pams nipples as Tobys grundle.
Kevin|  Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Meredith|  I have a shirt like that in my car.
Michael|  Okay, yeah, why dont you go get it?
Erin|  Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  Were already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Michael|  Okay, the opposite of that?
Kevin|  Stick spicy food up her butt.
Jim|  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, lets go to the hospital.  Pam, lets go to the hospital right now.
Pam|  Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but youre really distracting me from my distractions.
Jim|  Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Pam|  Why dont you go do some work?
Jim|  Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Pam|  I know, you dont like to be frazzled.
Jim|  No, I dont.
Pam|  Okay.
Jim|  Oh, and by the way, hate that youre helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Michael|  Ooh, someones freakin.
Andy|  A little frazzled.
Michael|  I think he is.
Jim|  I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously shes gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that Im crazy.  But Im not crazy, shes crazy.  Im not crazy, shes crazy.    Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
Dwight|  Acceptable names include and are limited to  Ebenezer.
Angela|  Jedediah.
Dwight|  Jonas.
Angela|  Jedediah.
Dwight|  Warf.
Angela|  No Star Trek names.
Dwight|  Okay.  Fine.
Angela|  What if its a girl?
Dwight|  Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Angela|  Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You cant put that in here.
Dwight|  Yes you can.
Angela|  No.
Dwight|  Its as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Angela|  Absolutely not.
Jim|    Hey.
Pam|  Hey.  Im not going to get in the car, because I know if I do youll try to drive me to the hospital.
Jim|  Ah, you know me too well.
Pam|  Okay, Jim.
Jim|  Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Pam|  Everything is fine.  You dont have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  Shes not coming out for a while, okay?
Jim|  Did you say "she?"
Pam|  I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldnt wait...  Oh, God, dont be mad.
Jim|  Mad?  How could I be mad?  Were having a little girl.
Pam|  Mm-hmm.
Jim|  Wow, were having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Pam|  I know.
Jim|  Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Pam|  Good.
Jim|  Yeah.
Pam|  Okay.
Jim|  Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Pam|  Oh, yeah, my water broke.
Jim|  Oh.  Oh...
Pam|    Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
Michael|  Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, its time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
Phyllis|  No, its 435.
Michael|  435.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didnt have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Lets go to the hospital, shall we?
Pam|  No, not yet, Michael.
Michael|  We can do...
Pam|  Oh, wow, its almost time for ultra feast!  Wheres Kevin?
Michael|  Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
Oscar|  Thats fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Michael|  What is October feast?
Pam|  There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  Ill get there.  And if I dont get there, I dont get there.
Kevin|  Our ultra feast menus theme  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
Pam|  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Im fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said its still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Michael|  Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and its time to go to the hospital.
Jim|  Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Michael|  Thats right, lets do this.
Jim|  Lets give it a shot.
Pam|  Nope.  No, no, thats better.  That wasnt even the worst of them.  Im fine.
Jim|  Hey, come on.  Lets go to the hospital.
Pam|  Theyre not that bad still, babe.
Jim|  Pam, Pam, its time.  Lets go to the hospital.
Pam|  No, its passing, its fine.  Its okay.  
Jim|  Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Michael|  Lets go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
Pam|  No, its passing, its fine.
Jim|  Pam.
Pam|  Ah, no, it passed.  Its good.
Jim|  You know what?  Lets go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Pam|  Okay, Im not going.  Im not...  Its fine.    Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  Im not going today because I cant do it, I dont think I can do it.
Jim|  Hey, are you kidding me?
Michael|  Are you kidding?
Jim|  If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Michael|  You can do this.  You can do this.
Jim|  Pam, Im scared.  Im real scared.
Michael|  Im scared, too.
Kevin|  Im petrified.
Jim|  The best news is, were going to have a baby today.
Michael|  Yeah.
Jim|  A really awesome baby.
Michael|  Were going to have a baby.
Jim|  So lets have it at the hospital.
Michael|  Lets do that.
Jim|  How are we doing on contractions?
Michael|  Two minutes apart.
Jim|  Two minutes...
Pam|  Oh, God.  Oh, no.
Jim|  Michael, I told you.
Michael|  Its okay.
Jim|  No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Pam|  Jim, we waited too long!
Michael|  I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Jim|  We waited too long!  Two minutes doesnt do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Michael|  Were okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
Pam|  I dont want to have my baby here.
Michael|  Youre not going to.  You know where youre going?
Pam|  The hospital.
Michael|  Yes, you are.  And you know what youre going to have?
Pam|  A baby.
Michael|  Yes!  Were going to the hospital and were going to have a baby.
Michael|  I got it!  I got it!  Everybody its go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Dwight|  No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Jim|  Alright, were driving ourselves, actually.
Michael|  No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
Jim|  Alright, I have my wallet.
Michael|  Yes.
Jim|  Go bags in the car...  Keys, my keys, wheres my keys?
Michael|  Go bag! Wheres my go bag?  Wheres my go bag?
Erin|  Theres nothing in it.
Michael|  You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Oscar|  The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Dwight|  Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
Pam|  Dwight, get away!
Michael|  No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Erin|  I didnt know we had a tape measure.
Dwight|   "We" dont.
Jim|  Okay, I cant find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found em.  Theyre here.
Dwight, Jim and Michael|  Here we go!
Phyllis|  Good luck!
Nick|  Good luck, Pam!
Michael|  Thank you!  Wish me luck!
Creed|  Have fun!  
Meredith|  Hey, its 500!
Michael|   Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
Stanley|  Hold it!
Michael|  Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  Were going now!
Toby|  Oh, one more!
Michael|  No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Michael|  Dwight, what is the traffic like?  
Dwight|  Doesnt matter.  Ill escort you!
Michael|  Alright.
Dwight|  Lets go!
Michael|  Geesh, Dwight!
Dwight|   Michael!
Michael|  What!?
Dwight|  This is where I saw that deer last week.
Michael|  Where?
Dwight|  Right over by that fence.
Michael|  By the bushes?
Jim|  Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Michael|  Okay, go, go, go, go!
Dwight|  Lets go!
Dwight|  I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Jim|  Alright, here we go!  Youre doing great!  Shell be here soon.
Michael|  Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Pam|  Michael!
Michael|  Yeah?
Pam|  Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Jim|  Michael, come on!
Michael|  Im texting about you, okay!?
Dwight|  Ugh, alright.    Lets move!  ...  What?
Policeman|  Pull over!
Dwight|  Are you kidding me?
Policeman|  Pull over!    Youre not allowed to impersonate a police officer!  Dont make this difficult, Dwight!
Pam|  Wait, wait.  My iPods not in here!
Jim|  Okay.
Pam|  It has the birth song on it!
Jim|  Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  Well be fine.
Pam|  Jim, I dont want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
Jim|  Okay, so what do you want to do?
Pam|  I dont know!  Lets go by the house and get it.  Its only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Jim|  Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  Were going to the hospital now.
Michael|  Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.    Ready?
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute.
Michael|  Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Dwight|  Why didnt you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IMing you how bored I was.
Michael|  Okay.
Pam|  Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think its on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Dwight|  I dont need a key.
Pam|  Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen its under the...
Dwight|  No, no, dont, dont tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Pam|  Dwight just listen!  Its underneath...  
Michael|  Okay.
Jim|  Wait, you alright?
Pam|  Yes.
Michael|  Do you have everything, guys?
Jim|  Michael, just go park the car.
Michael|  Okay, alright.  
Hospital employee|  Sir!  You cant park here!
Michael|  Dunder-Mifflin.  Its okay.    I just did.
Jim|  Pams doing great.  Uh, shes ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And shes also fully faced.  Which I dont know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  Its only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Nurse|  Daddy?  Shes ready to push.
Jim|  Okay.
Michael|  Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
Jim|    Doing great, push again.
Doctor|  Not yet.
Jim|  No, dont push.  Pull.  Pull.
Nurse|  Why dont you get more ice chips?
Pam|  No, Jim, stay!
Doctor|  Okay.  Really push this time, Pam.
Pam|  Okay.
Michael|    Okay, not yet, not yet.  Im going to go wash my eyes.
Michael|  That kids going to have a lot of hair.
Andy|  Hey, have you guys seen her?
Meredith|  She hasnt popped yet.
Andy|  What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
Andy|  I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with todays paper.
Phyllis|  This is ridiculous.  We just cant wait here.
Michael|  I think its going to be any minute now.
Phyllis|  But you dont know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Michael|  Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Phyllis|  I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Michael|  Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
Michael|    Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
Pam|  This is happening!
Michael|  Youre starting, youre kinda losing them.
Jim|  Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, shes so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Pam|  Oh, my God.
Michael|    Yeah, thats right.  Its a baby, see?
Doctor|  Sir!  Sir, you cant smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out.
Michael|  Okay.  You cant smoke anywhere these days.
Pam|    Shes incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Jim|  No, lets let her rest.  Im sure theres still twelve on each.
Pam|  Okay.
Michael|  Guys, guys!
Jim|  Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Michael|  Eleven pounds...
Jim|  Shes seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Everyone|  Yeah!
Michael|  Thank you!  Thank you!
Oscar|  Congratulations.  Thats great.
(Pams mom) Heleen|  Hi there.
Jim|  Hey, grandmas back.
Helene|  Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Jim|  Great.
Pam|  Oh, thank God.  I havent had caffeine in nine months.
Helene|  Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
Jim|  Oh.  Let me get it.
Jim|  I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Michael|  Wheres the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
Helene|  Hello, Michael.
Michael|  Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Helene|  Im, uh...  You know I think, uh, I think its time for me to go.
Pam|  Okay.
Helene|  Love you.
Michael|  Love you, as a friend.
Pam|  Love you, mom.
Michael|  Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Pam|  Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Michael|  Alright.
Pam|  Again, no pants.
Michael|  Oh, okay.
Jim|  Ready?
Michael|  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
Jim|  Its so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Dwight|  Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pams house to find Pams iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didnt find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good nights sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work .
Michael|  There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
Andy|  This man has a gift!
Michael|  Who else here is single?
Kelly|  Im not single.  I have a man. 
Michael|  I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Stanley|  Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Michael|  Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you dont have any?    Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Ryan|  Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Michael|  Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, youre obviously single.
Meredith|  You know it.  I am never getting married.
Meredith|  Like Clooney.
Michael|  Andrew, what about you?
Andy|  Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Andy|  Yes, Im going to ask out Erin.  Im just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and Id like for the moon to be visible.
Michael|  Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
Pam|  Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Jim|  We were just kids.  What did we know?
Nurse|  How we doing?
Jim|  Great.
Pam|  Good.
Nurse|  Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Pam|  Doesnt she sleep here?
Nurse|  She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  Youve been through a lot.
Jim|  I think well be okay.
Nurse|  Okay, great.
Pam|    Oh, big yawn.
Jim|  Ready?  One, two, three...
Pam|  One, and then wrap around.  Its okay.  Hold that arm down.
Jim|  I cant.  Shes too strong.  Shes, careful, though.  You dont want to break it.
Pam|  Shes not gonna...  Just...
Jim|  I got it.  Alright.
Pam|  Go.
Jim|  Nurse!
Jim|  How you doing?
Pam|  I dont know.  I just, I cant tell if shes getting anything.
Jim|  Really?
Pam|  Doesnt feel right.
Jim|  Well, youre pushing the milk out, right?
Pam|  How does one do that?
Jim|  Wasnt it...  Its kinda like a...  Like that.
Pam|  Do you want to try it, Jim?
Jim|  I think youre good.  Doing a good job.
Nurse|  Somebody buzzed?
Jim|  Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Pam|  I cant tell if shes getting anything.  It just doesnt really feel right.  
Nurse|  Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
Pam|  Even if shes not getting anything?
Nurse|  Yeah, shell be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since were in the nursery.
Pam|  No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Nurse|  Oh, good.  You know everything.
Pam|  Shes just, shes really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Nurse|  Well, Ill bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Jim|  Alright.
Nurse|  Alright.
Jim|  Its going to be alright.
Pam|  Maybe itll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Jim|  Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Erin|    You wanted to see me?
Michael|  What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Erin|  Oh, boy!  ...  Whats that sound?
Kevin|    Ta-da!
Michael|  I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Kevin|  Yes!
Erin|  I dont know what to say.
Kevin|  Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Michael|  Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop em in your mouth.  Why dont you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
Kevin|  Erin, would you have lunch with me?
Erin|  Okay.
Michael|  Good!
Kevin|  Yes!
Erin|  Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Michael|  Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Kevin|  Bye.
Michael|  Bye.
Erin|  Im so sorry if I gave you the impression Im into Kevin, but Im not.  I like Andy.
Michael|  Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
Erin|  Im sure hell be fine.
Michael|  Im not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Erin|  Really?
Michael|  No, Kevin doesnt have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it wont kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Erin|  I dont want anyone to die.
Michael|  Just dont let him sit on you...  Im kidding.  Youll have fun.  Itll be good.  Itll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
Kevin|  Hi.
Erin|  Hi.
Kevin|  She touched my shoulder.
Nurse|  Hey, guys.  Were short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
Jim|  Oh, hi.
Kathy|  Hi.
Dale|  Hi, so sorry.
Jim|  Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Pam|  I know.
Jim|  You see that?  Im pretty sure shes...  Hi.
Erin|  Did you grow up around here?  
Kevin|  No.
Erin|  So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Kevin|  Yes.
Andy|  Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guys going to fail this class," or, "Whats this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?"  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted." ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
Hospital employee|  Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?
Pam|  Yes?
Hospital employee|  Hi.  Im Clark.  Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Pam|  Um, yeah, that would be great.
Jim|  Yup.  Really great.  Whens she available?
Clark|  Actually, uh, Im the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, lets see what were working with.
Pam|  So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Clark|  Ill get that for you.
Pam|  Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I cant tell if Im really producing.  I dont know if shes getting anything.
Clark|  Okay.  Let me feel here.
Pam|  Okay.
Clark|  Yeah, its quite full.  Why dont you put your hand on top of my hand.
Pam|  Okay.
Clark|  When youre feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Pam|  No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
Clark|  Okay.
Jim|  Are you sure it doesnt hurt?
Pam|  No.  It just feels like pressure.
Clark|  Okay, well.  Feel how Im flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Jim|  Yup.
Clark|  Stimulate it.
Jim|  Yeah.
Clark|  Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Jim|  Perfect.
Clark|  And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Jim|  I think she will.
Pam|  Okay.  So, Im just not sure if Im releasing, though.  Im not sure if...
Jim|  Well figure it out.
Clark|  It doesnt...  Why dont you bring your baby over here...  Shes beautiful.
Pam|  Okay.  Aw, thank you.
Clark|  Yes, congratulations.
Jim|  Thank you.
Clark|  Well, youre doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and Ill come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
Pam|  Okay.
Jim|  Please do.
Pam|  Oh, shoot.  
Jim|  What?
Pam|  Shoot, she fell off.
Jim|  Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Pam|  Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Jim|  No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Pam|  Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think itd be weird if you did it.
Jim|  Okay, Ill just go get the other guy.
Dwight|    Hey, whats up, kid?
Angela|  Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract Ive prepared for you?
Dwight|  Nothing left to do except dot the Is, the Js, and the umlauts.  Why dont you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Angela|  I look forward to it.
Dwight|  Very well.
Angela|  Goodbye.
Pam|    Jim, Jim, get her.
Jim|  Hmm?
Pam|  Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
 Jim|  Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  
Pam|  I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.  
Jim|  Thats amazing.
Pam|  Oh, my God.  I didnt even have to do the "C thing."
Jim|  Thats awesome.
Pam|  Aw, were doing it.
Jim|  thats great.
Pam|  Were really parents now.
Jim|  Mm-hmm.
Michael|  Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
Erin|  Hey.
Kevin|  Hi.
Erin|  I have really enjoyed our time together.
Kevin|  Yeah, me too.
Erin|  I want to continue working on our friendship.
Kevin|  Really, really fun.
Erin|  Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Kevin|  Yeah, me too.
Erin|  And, youre my friend.
Kevin|  Yeah.
Erin|  And I hope that Im your friend...  And, maybe...
Kevin|  Yeah.
Michael|  Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Kevin|  You said she liked me.
Michael|  Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And Im surprised that you didnt question me in the first place.
Kevin|  Ive dumped better than Erin.
Michael|  No.
Kevin|  Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Michael|  Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Kevin|  Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Michael|  This isnt about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Andy|    Ow.
Michael|  Kev...  Nice.  Going.
Erin|  Well...
Isabelle|  Knock knock.
Pam|  Oh, hey, Isabelle.
Jim|  Hey.
Isabelle|  Hey.  Pam, shes gorgeous.  Can I hold her?
Pam|  Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but shes totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I dont want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Jim|  What?
Pam|  Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Jim|  Okay, okay.
Pam|  Oh, my gosh.
Kathy|    Oh,has she been fussing long?
Pam|  No, not at all.
Jim|  Perfect.
Kathy|  I was out like a light...  Oh, shes not hungry...
Nurse|  Hows it going?
Pam|  Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she wont latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Jim|  Ha ha ha.
Nurse|  Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?
Jim|  We definitely are.  At 300, right?  You said we could stay until 300?
Nurse|  Yeah, you can.  Its 235.
Jim|  Half hour.
Nurse|  Twenty five minutes.  And youre all set with the car seat?
Jim|  Yes, car seats right there.
Nurse|  That bottom part needs to go in the car.
Jim|  Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Nurse|  Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Jim|  Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I dont...  I dont think she heard me.
Isabelle|    Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?
Dwight|  Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Isabelle|  Wow, ha.  New cabinets.
Dwight|  Yup.
Isabelle|  All I did was bring macaroni and cheese...  Wheres the fridge?
Dwight|  Oh, its...  In the backyard.  Ill take this.
Isabelle|  Oh...  Well, Ill let you get back to it.
Dwight|  Hey, listen.  I know that Im an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Isabelle|  Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
Dwight|  Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Isabelle|  Yeah...
Dwight|  Alright.  Ill call you, kid.
Isabelle|  Do that.
Jim|  Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Hospital employee|  Yeah.
Jim|  But you hear the baby crying, right?
Hospital employee|  Mm-hmm...  Wheres your car?
Jim|  Uh, its in the lot.
Hospital employee|  Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.
Jim|  Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Pam|  Okay, please hurry.
Andy|  Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  Its really important, so Im going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Erin|  Okay, good.
Andy|  The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Erin|  Its busy.  Why dont I keep trying, and then Ill give you the confirmation in a bit?
Andy|  Sorry, thats unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or youre fired.
Erin|    You cant talk to me like that.  I didnt do anything wrong.  Ive been having a tough day today.
Andy|  Oh, God, no.  Im...  Just read the fax.
Erin|  You read the fax.
Andy|  Im...  Im asking you out.
Erin|  Oh, my God.  Thats amazing.  Let me just fax this, and Ill check my planner.
Andy|  So, its a date.
Erin|  Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Andy|  Yeah, what day?  What day?
Erin|  Everyday is fine.  Or...
Andy|  Well, that, whats that one?
Erin|  Thursday?
Andy|  Okay.  Lets do it.
Erin|  Okay.
Hospital employee|  Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Pam|  Oh, yeah, sorry.
Hospital employee|  Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.
Pam|  Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Jim|  Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Pam|  Hi.  We did it.
Jim|  You used my move, didnt you?
Pam|  I used a variation of your move.
Michael|    There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think Im going to be sick...
Dwight|  Two forms of ID, please.
Angela|  And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
Dwight|  Nothing.
Angela|  Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Dwight|  Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...    I couldnt find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  Ill be out of your hair.
