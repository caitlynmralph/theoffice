Dwight|  Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
Jim| Too loud. 
Dwight| --the party planning committee...
Jim| Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Dwight| But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
Everyone| Merry Christmas.
Dwight| Merry Christmas. Good.
Dwight| My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph!  Not really! Im just tired. The days are short. I dont know. Maybe Im depressed.
Dwight| It is time to unveil the tree.
Oscar| Hey, Rockefeller Center! 
Jim| Yeah.
Ryan| Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Jim| This is all we have.
Ryan| Ugh.
Jim| No, its not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
Dwight| It is warm feelings.
Meredith| Why dont we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Dwight| Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! 
Jim| Why would you start so high? 
Dwight| Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Jim| Three, two, one! 
Phyllis| Ooh.
Pam| Ah!
Phyllis| You didnt decorate it?
Jim| No.
Dwight| Exactly.
Jim| We didnt, because we think itd be better to do it together.
Dwight| Everyone.
Andy| Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if youre not covering anything up?
Pam| Is it, is it fake?
Jim| Pam!
Dwight| Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
Jim| Yes.
Dwight| Like the spirit of Christmas!
Stanley| Were supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Dwight| This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas! 
Erin| Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. Im not sure Ive earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I cant take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Kelly| What psycho would send that as a gift? 
Andy| I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? 
Phyllis| Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! Its me, Santa Claus!
Dwight| Hey Santa!
Oscar| They finally let you do it!
Phyllis| Yeah!
Kevin| Congrats Phil!
Erin| Its so edgy!
Phyllis| I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it.  Its been a long journey... but  Im Santa Claus!
Pam| So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
Phyllis| Its going to be a very jolly time if youve been good!
Creed| What if youve been bad?
Phyllis| Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Creed| What if youve been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Jim| Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Phyllis| Yeah.
Dwight| For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that Ive been attempting to assemble. Im suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
Pam| You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if its a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Oscar| Thats funny.
Pam| Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.   I think my water just broke!
Oscar| Thats too funny.
Pam| Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Michael| Heeeeeeres Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. 
Pam| Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
Michael| What the hell is going on?
Michael| Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
Jim| Yeah.
Michael| Phyllis?
Jim| Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Michael| Take it back. That is absurd.
Jim| No, Im not gonna do that.
Michael| No? No! Jim! Come on!
Jim| I think shes doing a good job.
Michael| Its insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesnt it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
Jim| Im not gonna go tell Phyllis that she cant be Santa.
Michael| Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
Michael| If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and shed ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. Its a good thing Russia doesnt exist anymore.
Michael|  Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, Im the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
Group|  Okay...
Michael| No its not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, whats your name?
Kevin| Michael its me, Kevin. Phyllis says Im too big for her lap.
Michael| Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
Kevin| When can I sit on your lap?
Michael| Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
Kevin| Thats really comfortable. 
Michael| What would you like for Christmas little boy?
Kevin| I dont know. I didnt know you were gonna ask me that.
Michael| What did you think was going to happen?
Kevin| I didnt know. Nobodys ever let me sit on their lap before.
Michael| All right, just say "some toys" please.
Kevin| Can you give me some choices? Cause I really dont want to mess up on this list.
Michael| Damn it Kevin, come on.
Kevin| What about if I tell you the things I dont want?
Michael| Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
Kevin| I didnt even get to tell you what I wanted!
Michael| Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesnt have to go through this again.
Kevin| Awesome.
Phyllis| Well?
Jim| Im trying Phyllis. Youre Santa.
Phyllis| The only Santa.
Jim| Thats what I want.
Phyllis| You promised me this. Dont make me get Bob involved!
Jim| What would Bob do?
Phyllis| Never mind, I shouldnt have said that.
Andy| Does it hurt?
Erin| It stings a lot.
Andy| Hmm.
Erin| I keep trying to figure out whos sending me these gifts.
Andy| I know, right?
Erin| So far no one will admit to it. 
Andy| Huh!
Erin| Is it you? 
Andy| Yeah! Totally! I admit it! Its me.
Erin| Seriously?
Andy| "Seriously?" Are you serious?
Erin| What?
Andy| Yeah! Totally serious! Im your Secret Santa! Busted! 
Oscar| There he is. 
Daryl| Hey.
Oscar| Is Matt around? I got his check.
Daryl| Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, Ill take it.
Oscar| Ah, Ill just... wait for him.
Daryl| Matts a pretty good-looking dude, dont you think?
Oscar| Ill just leave it here with you. 
Michael| Ryan come here! 
Ryan| Whoa, whoa.
Michael| Come on, come on.
Ryan| Im doing something over here.
Michael| Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here! 
Ryan| What are you talking about?
Michael| Just sit down!
Ryan| No no no.
Jim| Hey hey hey. Everything okay? 
Michael| Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
Jim| Can I just talk to you for a second?
Michael| Whoop! Okay, what?
Jim| You cant yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap! 
Michael| Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! 
Jim| Yup.
Michael| Do you understand, you forced my hand?
Jim| Michael, its Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Michael| Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why dont "we" take a vote on it?
Jim| Great!
Michael| Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
Jim| Who wants Phyllis as Santa? 
Michael| No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
Kevin| Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
Jim| And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.   Can I get you some punch?
Michael| Ill get some punch. That looks delicious. 
Office| Aw, Michael! 
Dwight| Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
Phyllis| How do you know its a gun?
Dwight| What else does it look like?
Stanley| Not a gun.
Dwight| Well I dont have all the pieces yet.
Stanley| Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you dont have a gun.
Dwight| Not a gun. 
Phyllis| In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, lets put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringles eye! Let the party begin! 
Michael| I dont ask for much for Christmas, I really dont. Its not like Im begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or Im gonna kill myself."  Thats not - I dont care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, dont look at me.
Michael| Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, thats great. Im excited by that. And those of you who dont, I forgive you. But I never forget.
Toby| Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Michael| Oh the Anti-Christ! 
Toby| You cant,  Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
Michael| Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what youre saying?
Toby| No!
Michael| Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
Andy| Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that Im her Secret Santa?
Phyllis| All right sweetie, Ill tell her its Michael.
Andy| Okay.
Kelly and Erin|  I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day...
Pam| Have you talked to him? 
Oscar| Who?
Pam| Matt?
Oscar| Is it that obvious?   No- hey...
Pam| Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?  
Matt| I dont think so.
Pam| Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Matt| I had some.
Pam| Oscars pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Oscar| Okay Pam.
Pam| Okay.
Pam| Yes! Theyre the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
Phyllis| This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Dwight| We dont have a North Pole branch. Idiot.  
Michael|  Uh oh, whats Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
Dwight| Yes! 
Michael| Oh yes. Its space garbage. Dwights gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
Phyllis| Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! Youve been very good this year -
Stanley| I have.
Michael|  Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adulterys a sin, look it up in the Bible people. Whatd you get?
Kevin| He got scented candles!
Michael|  Oh, thats appropriate. Lot of fire where youre going. Better get used to it. Youre going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. Youre going to Hell Stanley.
Angela| Amen.
Phyllis| And this brings us to you, little one.
Michael|  I cant see from here people. Somebody shout it out, dont make me get up.
Angela| Its fabric! I really wanted this.
Michael|  Thats fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
Angela| Andy, is this you?
Michael|  No!
Phyllis| Its a secret.
Michael|  Andy had Erin.
Andy| Nnnnya.
Michael|  What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.
Jim|  No. 
David| Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
Michael| David, guess who Im sitting here dressed as.
David| Im not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Michael| Ill give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
David| Michael...
Michael| Im Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
David| Michael-
Michael| What?
David| This is a very very bad time.
Michael| Really? Whats going on?
David| Stephanie, can you hop off please?
Stephanie| Sure David. 
Michael| What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Erin| Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Michael| Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
David| Listen, I shouldnt tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house. 
Michael| What does that mean?
David| Ill be fired. 
Michael| Well, cant Alan protect you?
David| Alan will be out too. All of us.
Michael| All of us?
David| Goodbye Michael.
Michael| Oh my God.
Michael| Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And thats one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
Michael| Hey. Hows everybody doing?
Jim| Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
Michael| That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Angela| Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
Michael| You know whats even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Heres my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
Dwight| Whats your pin number?
Michael| I dont want to say. But, "its fun to stay at the -" 
Michael| "Its fun to stay at the -"
Dwight| Where? Holiday Inn? I dont ...
Michael|  Mmm, mm mm mm. 
Andy| I, I thought that you would like it.
Erin| It was a little much Andy.
Andy| Well its the thought that counts. 
Erin| What were you thinking? 
Andy| I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen. 
Michael| You know what, Christmas isnt about Santa, or Jesus. Its about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, youre my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, youre our mailman. And I cant help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?" 
Jim| What?
Pam| How could we do what? 
Michael| Its not... Nevermind. Nothing. 
Stanley| We deserve to know.
Michael| I didnt say anything!
Angela|  If you know something Michael...
Michael| Were going out of business!
Group| WHAT?
Jim| What?
Dwight| You are kidding me!
Jim| Wait wait wait, who said that?
Michael| David told me on the phone. David told me.
Dwight| When? When did he tell you? Today?
Michael| Earlier today. 
Dwight| Awww!
Michael| He said, we have been sold. 
Jim| What?
Dwight| Aaaarrhh!  
Michael| Dwight! Jesus! 
Angela| Come on!
Jim| Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Michael| Davids gone. Alans gone. Were all gone.
Jim| Okay. We havent gone under. Weve been sold and that can mean many different things.
Michael| Its hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
Meredith| No, I get it.
Michael| Ill call him. Ill call David.
Jim| No, you wont, because hes not picking up his phone.
Michael| Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
Michael| He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them Im a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
David| Hey Sweetie, what is it?
Michael| Its not sweetie, its Michael Scott.
David| What the hell?
Michael| Stephanie could you hop off please?
David| Michael, I have never-
Michael| David!
David| Ever, ever...
Michael| David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
Dwight| Hey David.
Kelly| Hi David! 
David| Hello everyone.
Michael| David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
David| You werent supposed to tell anyone Michael.
Michael| Well I think were past that now.
David| I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you dont know.
Jim| Oh my God, David. Thats horrible.
Meredith| How bout us? Its Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
David| Look. Theyre buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
Michael| Were not fired?
David| No! No, and congratulations.
Michael| Yeah!  Its a Christmas miracle! 
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| Woo hoo! 
Dwight|  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Dont know where it goes, but its home to me and I walk alone. 
Dwight| Its true. We all walk alone.
Kelly|  Jim.... Jim! 
Dwight|  My shadows the only one that walks beside me. My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating...
Toby|  Wow! Cause... 
Ryan| Yeah! That was the idea.
Toby| Thank you! 
Ryan| Awesome!
Toby| Thanks man! 
Kevin|  Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
Michael| Oh! You got it? What is that? 
Dwight| I have no idea.
Michael| Huh. Well, maybe those will help. 
Dwight| Michael? Please! Come on!
Matt| Nice to meet you Oscar. 
Oscar| Nice to meet you Mark! 
Matt| Its Matt.
Oscar| Right, Matt.  I know what Im doing, Pam.
Dwight| Oh man!  I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
Michael| Hi Santa.
Phyllis| Hi Michael.  Mm. kay.
Michael| Id like to make a wish.
Phyllis| What? 
Michael| I would like an Xbox, and a TV thats compatible with an Xbox. And, Im sorry.
Phyllis| An Xbox it is. Because Ive decided youre a good boy.
Bob Vance| Scott! What in the hell is going on here?  
Phyllis| No Bob, we worked it out.
Michael| You called Bob? 
Phyllis| Im sorry, 
Michael| Come on! Phyllis!
Phyllis| Im really sorry. It was earlier today.
Michael| Okay.
Phyllis| Hi sweetie.
Bob| You okay baby? 
Phyllis| Im good baby. 
Michael| Oh God. Get a room Santas!
Michael| Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays. 
Dwight| Its real slippery out here. 
Jim| Oh my God!
Pam| Twelve drummers drumming. 
Andy| Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!
