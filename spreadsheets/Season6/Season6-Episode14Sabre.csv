Michael| Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how bout you? 
Erin|  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how bout you? 
Oscar| I think you dont know what youre saying.
Michael| Its from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder whats inside. Scissor me. 
Michael|  Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.   They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didnt need them touching our asses.
Michael| Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
Dwight| Here we go.  Oh! Wow. 
Michael| Cool. What next? 
Erin| Guys, um, whos Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, whos coming tomorrow?
Michael| Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control - 
Dwight| Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Michael| Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
Dwight| Terrible mistake.
Michael| And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Dwight| Undistributable.
Pam| Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
Dwight| Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Oscar| I think we can do it. 
Pam|  Yep, yep.
Oscar| Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle - 
Pam| Yep.
Oscar| Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
Pam| Yes. 
Creed| Have you tried making everything smaller?
Michael| And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. 
Pam| Oh, Michael.
Michael| Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. 
Pam| No, dont!
Michael|  Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Michael| Alright, hes on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
Pam| What do you want us to do?
Michael| Why do I have to explain everything?
Pam| Because were usually not on the same page.
Michael| Okay. 
Gabe| Oh. Okay. And to you. 
Michael| Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons. 
Dwight| Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
Michael| You know what, Dwight? Lets give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
Gabe| Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
Michael| Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. 
Jim| Co-manager, actually.
Michael| In training. 
Jim| Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
Gabe| We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger. 
Michael| Were very excited too, arent we guys? Right?
Dwight| So excited. 
Michael| We have a little song prepared for you.
Gabe| Um, actually, if you dont mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. 
Michael| Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
Dwight| Oh. Of course.
Michael| Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
Andy| Ok.  
Andy &amp; Erin|  Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the "Electric City" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab - 
Michael| Saber.
Andy| Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
Andy &amp; Erin| Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre. 
Andy| You sure its saber?
Pam| Hey. 
Jim| Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 1120.
Pam| Oh, you mapquested it. Its four blocks away. 
Jim| Well, now we wont get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Pam| We found a great local daycare. Its rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means its also really hard to get into.
Jim| Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. Thats weird.
Pam| Were hoping our interview seals the deal.
Jim| But if not, theres always the army. The infantry.
Pam| Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Christian Slater| So youve just been bought by Sabre. Youve probably got a lot of questions. Hi. Im Christian Slater. Whats it like to work for Sabre? Lets find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will.
Jo Bennett| Youll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. Were very excited to go on this journey with you.
Jim|  So youve been shown a nonsensical video. Youre probably wondering, "Whats going on?" Well, youre not alone. 
Michael| Wow. Really terrific. 
Gabe| Most of our business comes from selling printers. So dont think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper. 
Michael| Perfect.
Michael| No. Dont like that.
Gabe| At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your - 
Meredith| Talk about vacation days!
Gabe| We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
Oscar| But I banked six weeks.
Angela| I already booked a Great Lakes cruise. 
Meredith| Hey, who the hells going through our stuff?
Gabe| Actually, thats Nick. Hes your new IT guy. Uh, hes setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
Michael| Mm, nope. Dont like that. 
Gabe| Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment. 
Michael| Well still get to use the little cups, though, right?
Gabe| Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
Michael| I dont know what theyre made of.
Dwight|  Theyre 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. 
Gabe| Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
Michael| You know what cant fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everythings running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
Stanley| Thats ok.
Michael| There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - 
Michael|  Really? You dont have enough water in there? Your stomach?
Toby| Oop. 
Michael| What?
Toby| Looks like we kicked it. 
Michael| I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
Michael| I dont want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabres doing for us.
Gabe| Oh, I dont get that sense at all from you, so...
Michael| Well, you should have a little. But its great that you dont, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but Im - Ill be honest, Im having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of em.
Gabe| Which ones?
Michael| All of them.
Gabe| Well, I wish that I could do something, but its kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
Michael| So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. Im good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
Gabe| You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Jim|  Ok, this is officially the cutest thing Ive ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Pam| Theres a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Jim| Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Pam| What?
Jim| I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Pam| Who? The -
Jim| I dont know. I dont know.
Pam| The guy were meeting with? 
Jim| I dont know, I dont know.
Andy| I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
Erin| Well, I saw them in there. 
Andy| Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries."
Erin| I think when Andy finally asks me out hes going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I cant wait to see what he comes up with.
Andy| The balls totally in Erins court. After the whole drum line thing. 
Gabe|   First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
Jo| Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. 
Gabe| Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have  really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
Jo| Wait a minute, who is it? Whos there? Is there somebody in the room with you?  I want to see who it is. Turn me around.
Gabe| I dont - its just...
Jo| Turn me around. Now.  Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?
Michael| Hello. No. My names Michael Scott. Hello.
Jo| Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.
Michael| Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Jo| Aw, thank you. Ive been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?
Michael| Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
Jo| Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandsons snowball company, so youll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things. 
Michael| Ok. I feel very strongly that you cant just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. Hed know what to do. 
Jo| So listen, why dont you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you cant handle the changes.
Michael| I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
Jo| I would take until the end of the day if I were you. 
Jerry| Pam and Jim? Hey, Im Jerry. 
Pam| Hi Jerry.
Jim| Jerry.
Jerry| Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.
Jim| This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Jerry| Oh, so you saw it already?
Jim| No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasnt like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didnt focus on anything in particular. 
Pam| Its lovely.
Jerry|  Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.
Jim| Do it.
Jerry| Okay. Hi, this is Jerry.
Pam| Ok, youve got to pull it together.
Jim| We should just go. Hes really uncomfortable.
Pam| Hes uncomfortable because youre acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
Jim| What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Pam| Thats the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Jerry| Sorry about that. Right this way.
Jim| All right. 
Michael| I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry.
David| Michael. 
Michael| I hope youre not busy doing something.
David| No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
Michael| You sure?
David| You look great.
Michael| You look great too. 
David| You hungry? Im just having lunch.
Michael| Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
David| Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Teddy Wallace| Huh? Hey. 
Michael| Hey. Wow. 
David| Keep it up, son.
Michael| Really loud. 
Michael| Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend. 
David| Yeah.
Michael| Can I just stay here and never go back?
David| Things not going so well there?
Michael| Oh, man. How much time do you have?
David| I have a doctors appointment next Thursday.
Michael| Yeah.
Mrs. Wallace| Hey, honey. Hows your day going? Did you do anything cool?
David| Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Mrs. Wallace| Oh, cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didnt know if you did anything.
David| No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Michael| Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought Id come by, see...
Mrs. Wallace| No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?
Michael| I dont know. 
David| Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe well go outside. May -maybe well go outside.  Outside.
Jim| There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit. 
Jerry| That seems a bit premature, dont you think? I dont even know if I have a space for you yet, and youre already lining up your holiday plans.
Jim| Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, were kind of planners. But were also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. 
Jerry| Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.
Pam| Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? 
Jim| What?
Jerry| Seriously? You told her?
Jim| Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you. 
Jerry| And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
Jim| No.
Pam| Maybe, because it doesnt seem to be going super well.
Jerry| Well, you didnt consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?
Pam| Nope. Cause were really nice people but you dont seem to like us. 
Jerry| Im being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?
Jim| Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a childrens toilet? Why didnt you just lock the door, man?
Jerry| It doesnt lock for the childrens safety. 
Jim| Anybody could have walked in. 
Jerry| It was story time.
Michael| Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They dont let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
David| I dont know. I mean, what can you do? 
Michael| Exactly. What are you thinking?
David| I, I - Its a tough one. 
Michael| It is a tough one. 
David| I dont have any ideas for you there. 
Michael| Yeah. But one would be good.
David| Hey, oh, okay. Wait. 
Michael| Okay.
David| I want to tell you about a business idea I have. 
Michael| Okay.
David| Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. Its like a shop-vac type of thing.  Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks.  Picks it up!
Michael| So the kids making the noise to pick it up.
David| No. No, no, no. Thats the -thats the vacuum noise.
Michael| Oh, okay.
David| You-you dont like it.
Michael| No, I think it is-
David| No, its ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, hes gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... Its like shop-vac.  Did I say that?
Michael| Yep.
David| Itll be ok. 
Andy| Hey, any fun weekend plans?
Erin| No, you?
Andy| Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
Erin| Nothing. Its wide open.
Andy| Okay.
Andy| Thats as hard as I can hint. 
David| Hey, you know, if you want, Im sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. 
Michael| The what?
David| Suck it. Thats what its called. 
Michael| Oh, okay. 
David| Huh? Catchy. Kidsll love it.
Michael| Like it.
Michael| There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of em. 
Michael| See you later. 
David| Oh, Michael. 
Michael| Bye now.
David| Thank you for coming.
Michael| Thanks for having me. 
Michael| Well, thats not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallaces house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here. 
Michael| Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabes homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
Michael| You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. Thats the best thing? Really? Ugh. 
Michael| Well, Im not really one for making speeches.
Everyone| Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot.
Michael| But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. 
Angela| Thats your toast?
Michael| No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it. 
Phyllis| Michael, this isnt a toast. Youre just thinking out loud. 
Michael| Heres my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good. 
Kevin| Just cause you have liquid that doesnt make it a toast. 
Michael| Heres the toast. Im gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
All| To us and to Sabre. 
Michael| Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. Thats like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesnt it? Okay, anyway, welcome. 
David|  Well, its a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? Youre going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
Teddy| Suck it!
David| Yeah! 
Teddy| Suck it!
David| Yeah! 
Teddy| Suck it!
David| Yeah! Take out the Suck It and well...
Teddy| Suck it!
David| Yeah! 
Teddy| Suck it!
David| Yeah! 
Both| Take out my Suck It and well suck it. 
David| Yeah! Teddy!
Teddy| Yeah.
