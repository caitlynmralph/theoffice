Toby|  This here is a radon test kit.  Okay I will be putting em everywhere. And... please dont throw these out.  This is a radon test kit.  Please dont throw these out.  See them all over the office.
Michael|  Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured Id rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. 
Michael|  Pfffffttt.
Toby|  Come on, Michael. Youre interrupting.
Michael|  Youre kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Toby|  Please sit down.
Michael|  You know what? Were not gonna die of radon, were gonna die of boredom.
Everyone|  YEAH! 
Michael|  Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Everyone|  No. No! 
Jim|  Thats... not okay.
Michael|  Okay, alright.
Dwight|  You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Michael|  I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Dwight|  No, hmmm... thats still...
Everyone|  Mm-mm.
Michael|  Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
Creed|  Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Oscar|  All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Ryan|  Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Michael|  I dont know.
Stanley|  How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Jim|  Stanley, please, this is serious!
Angela|  Is this the thing where they use an icicle so theres no evidence?
Michael|  Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Dwight|  Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Heres how you do it  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.  Phyllis, youre Hitler. Come up here. Toby, youre Toby. Andy, youre Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
Toby|  I dont wanna do this.
Michael|   Toby, just do it! God!
Dwight|  Toby, come on. 
Dwight|  Ready, one bullet. And boom! 
Everyone|  Yeah, that works. That works!
Michael|  Good work. 
Pam|  What flavors did you get? 
Erin|  Its so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Pam|   Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Erin|  Do you want me to go back to the store?
Pam|  No, no, no, its fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open em up.
Erin|  This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Pam|  Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so were just trying to get out in front of this.
Erin|  After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? Thats what Pam told me.
Pam|   Yeah, or no... well... I dont know. Im sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise Id be running this.
Erin|  Thats okay. You probably shouldnt keep a baby up that late, though. 
Erin|  We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Pam|  And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Erin|  Hes coming.
Pam|  Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he gets like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you dont know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Toby|   Hey everyone.
Pam|  No, out! Get out now! Leave now. 
Dwight|  Leave, get outta here.
Pam|  Leave!
Dwight|  Right now!
Pam|  Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Michael|   Morning everyone.
Everyone|  Hey!  Hey, hey!
Erin|  Hi Michael. 
Michael|  Hello!
Dwight|  Michael, nice tie or something.
Michael|  Oh, thank you. Its reversible, I think. 
Kevin|  Thats hilarious.
Pam|  Thats awesome. You want some ice cream?
Michael|  Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles flavors? Cake it to the Limit. Thats my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Kevin|  Boi-oi-oi-ing
Michael|  Okay. Well... thats random. I will dig into those later.
Lawyer|  I dont follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..."
Dwight and Angela|  Joint custody
Lawyer|  Are we talking about your grandchildren?
Angela|  No.
Dwight|  No.
Angela|  Rather than spend all day in court, weve decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. 
Dwight|  Alleged contract.
Angela|  Alleged? Im going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Dwight|  Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, dont even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Dwight|  So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Angela|  Im doing it. You know I am. Its disgusting.
Dwight|  How do we know this? Id like to see a stool sample.
Angela|  Dwight, look at my teeth. 
Dwight|  Eughh. 
Andy|  No secret crying. Hasnt even opened the tissue box in there.
Pam|  Could he still be seeing her?
Phyllis|  I dont think hed do that.
Jim|  So were gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Andy|  Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Jim|  Exactly. It happened in Big.
Michael|  No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Jim|  Im really too tired to do this.
Pam|  Me too!
Jim|  Then lets just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Pam|  Hey Michael.
Michael|  Hey.
Pam|  We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
Jim|  We can order in from Hooters.
Michael|  Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Pam|  We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Jim|  Billy Joel Rock Band.
Michael|  That... exists?
Pam|  Yes.
Michael|  Okay, well, Ill have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Pam|   Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Michael|  Okay, Pam... shes not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Phyllis|  Oh Michael.
Michael|  Since when is this an office where we delve into each others personal lives?
Michael|  I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, its wrong.
Meredith|  That is something I would never do.
Michael|  Well, I think we all know what youre capable of Meredith.
Meredith|  Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Meredith|  I ask... everyone in the room, "Are you in a relationship?".
Michael|  People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
Kelly|  Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Ryan|  Okay.
Michael|  I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Andy|  How does he feel about it? 
Michael|  He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Jim|  Now youre just being hurtful.
Michael|  Im sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Phyllis|  Hey!
Michael|  On her diet! Hes a sports guy. Hes scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Andy|  Did Donna tell you that?
Michael|  Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
Andy|  So youre just making a giant assumption. You dont even know the guy.
Michael|  You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Andy|  My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. Ive lived the part. And let me tell you, Id so much rather play the part on stage.
Andy|  So... heres the thing about infidelity.
Michael|  Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. 
Andy|  How does that work?
Michael|  Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think hes an angel? I dont think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. 
Andy|  In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. Youre Ali Larter, Im Beyonce.
Michael|  I am Beyonce always.
Andy|  Not this time.
Michael|  Yes, I am.
Andy|  This guys a high school baseball coach, right? Lets go check him out, see what a horrible person he is. 
Michael|  I would love that.
Andy|  Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Lets go check it out. 
Michael|  I have work to do. 
Andy|  Oh, really? I thought you were the boss. 
Michael|  Lets go.  I cant wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what hes making me do to her. 
Andy|   Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Michael|  All right, Andy, please. 
Andy|  Baseball!
Michael|  Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. Thats him. Thats him.
Andy|  Where?
Michael|  Right there. The coach!
Andy|  Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Michael|  Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? 
Andy|   And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain. 
Michael|  All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
Andy|  Whatever. Im the one blending in. 
Gabe|   Guys?
Jim|  Pam.
Pam|  Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
Gabe|  Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
Pam|  You were supposed to be the Lookout.
Jim|  Yeah, well its really warm in here. Its like a sleeping bag.
Gabe|  I dont wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. 
Jim|  Sorry about that. 
Pam|  So embarrassing.
Gabe|  Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. 
Jim|  Well, you were surprisingly restrained. 
Pam|  We will be well-rested tomorrow.
Gabe|  Okay. Thats great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Jim|  Excellent. Go for it. 
Gabe|  Im sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on.  Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Jim|  Right? So, uh, lets uh...
Lawyer|  Finally theres a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
Angela|  Same page. Go to the next one.
Dwight|  Same page. Just keep moving.
Lawyer|  Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
Dwight|  Which we cant know.
Lawyer|  This is essentially...
Dwight|  Unless were unplugged.
Lawyer|  Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
Dwight|  And wake up in the future.
Lawyer|  Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
Dwight|  What?
Lawyer|  Look, I cant enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
Angela|  What?
Lawyer|  So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
Dwight|  What?
Dwight|  I dont have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I dont want to dig past a certain someone to get it. 
Andy|  Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Michael|  You have no idea what youre talking about.
Andy|  I know its like cricket.
Michael|  You dont. No, no.
Andy|  And its--theres-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
Michael|  You dont know. You dont-- you dont know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didnt even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet its like, "Hey, Donna, why dont you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why dont you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. Im taking all the credit."
Andy|  Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Michael|  Okay, well, thats because hes paying their salary. 
Andy|  You do know that high school coaches dont pay their players.
Michael|  I know, I know, I know. It--Im--it-- that was a euphemism.
Dwight|  $30,000? Theres gotta be another way. 
Angela|  He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Dwight|  Look, I will not pay.
Angela|  Well, I have an alternative.
Dwight|  "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
Lawyer|  Look, I dont think thats actually legal.
Dwight|  Agreed. 
Dwight|  Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Dwight|  But not in your bed. Its lumpy. 
Angela|  Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Dwight|  Fine. Five times. 
Lawyer|  Look, I cant legally watch this unfold. Its coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
Angela|  I want eye contact.
Dwight|  No.
Angela|  Yes. 
Dwight|  Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Angela|  Im not some farm animal. 
Andy|  Great game, coach.
Michael|  Shh! Okay, all right. Dont, dont.
Andy|  You guys are awesome! Best game Ive ever seen in my life.
Shane|  Yeah, right. You must be rootin for the other guys.
Andy|  Ha. The other guys can go die.
Michael|   Okay.
Andy|  Baseball! Go talk to him. 
Michael|  No. God. You go talk to him. 
Shane|  Lets go.
Andy|  Shane. Great game man!
Shane|  Do I know you?
Andy|  No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
Shane|  Are you somebodys... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kennys dads?
Andy|  Ha. No. No. But were gay for baseball. 
Shane|  Okay.
Andy|  But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot. 
Shane|  Okay. Lets go! 
Andy|  Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage. 
Shane|  Whoa!
Andy|  I mean, isnt marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Lets round you out as a person. 
Shane|  Hey, Im really sorry, Im just trying to... focus here on the game. 
Andy|  I get it, man. I love it. Thats what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife. 
Shane|  Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this. 
Andy|  Of course.
Shane|  All right.
Andy|  But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Michael|  No, no, no. 
Andy|  Come on, get over here.
Michael|  Im good. Oh, my God. 
Andy|  Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Michael|  Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Shane|  Its all right. Its all right. Keep it going. 
Michael|  Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My hearts still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "Im sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin Bond.
Michael|  Okay, orange slices. There ya go. 
Erin|  Thanks, Michael.
Michael|  Dont thank me. Thank Dylans mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Oscar|  Why would you throw something wet at me?
Michael|  You love it. There ya go. 
Jim|  Now, were those for the team?
Michael|  Uh, no, they didnt say team. They just said coal Hawks. 
Jim|  Ah.
Pam|  I dont think those were yours to take. 
Michael|  Well, then it wouldnt be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane. 
Andy|  I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. 
Pam|  Did you talk to him?
Michael|  I did.
Pam|  You talked to the man whose wife youre having an affair with. 
Kevin|  Wow. That is crazy. 
Phyllis|  Was there a fistfight? 
Michael|  No. We just talked. Hes very nice. 
Phyllis|  And it didnt change your mind. 
Michael|  It did not. 
Phyllis|  Michael, thats awful. 
Michael|  Isnt it?
Phyllis|  Yes.
Michael|  Im awful, arent I? 
Kevin|  Yeah. Thats pretty bad. 
Michael|  Im an awful guy! Ooh!
Oscar|  How can you live with yourself?
Michael|  I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when Im hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. 
Kevin|  That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Kelly|  Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store. 
Ryan|  I dont know why you were in that part of the bookstore. 
Kelly|  Cause its next to they baby section, okay?
Ryan|  All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology."
Kelly|  I dont really know why youre screaming at me right now.
Ryan|  Im not scream-- Im not screaming. 
Kelly|  Thats Merediths cake. Its her birthday.
Michael|  I dont care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. Thats Lemon.
Ryan|  Good for you, man. Good for you. 
Ryan|  He takes what he wants.
Ryan|  You know what? I think youre attractive, and I wanna sleep with you. 
Erin|  What about Kelly?
Ryan|  You read my mind. 
Erin|   Is this a joke?
Ryan|  Yep.
Ryan|  Its hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I dont know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I cant be that cold.
Michael|  Youll learn, baby. Youll learn.
Dwight|   I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I dont have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong,  but theyre no match for a grown Schrute man.    Lets see what she gets.   Aah!
Creed|   Uh, boss, were out of paper.
Michael|  Yeah, I noticed that. 
Creed|  Are you gonna add any more?
Michael|  Nope.
Creed|  He dont give an "F" about nothin!
Michael|  I have got big balls.
Pam|  I dont think Im gonna make it.
Jim|   What about an energy drink or something?
Pam|   It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Jim|  Well, it doesnt mean I cant drink it.
Pam|  Well, it does and it doesnt.
Darryl|  Probably shouldnt tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Jim|  A place?
Darryl|  A restful location. Talk to Glen. Hell take you up in the lift.
Pam|  You sleep in the warehouse?
Darryl|  Lightbulbs burnt out, so its dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when Im trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesnt exist, okay?
Jim|  Okay.
Darryl|  Pam.
Pam|  Okay.
Phyllis|  For your signature. 
Michael|  Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, thats...  All right, all right. You know what? Im sick of this. Im sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think thats going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Kevin|  Why not your condo?
Michael|  Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that were into isnt very condo-appropriate.
Stanley|  Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybodys spoken their mind, and no ones changing their mind.
Michael|  Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Andy|  Do you want someone to stop you? Cause no ones going to.
Michael|  Nobody better try to stop me. Good. 
Dwight|  I could have stopped him.
Dwight|  Are you warmed up? 
Angela|  No.
Dwight|  God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? 
Angela|  What did you do to yourself? 
Dwight|  Never mind. Just never mind. 
Angela|  Well, it better work.
Dwight|  Oh, itll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. Its not in the contract.
Michael|   How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And Im a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do whats right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Reporter|  Michael Scott?
Michael|  Yes?
Reporter|  Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
Michael|   Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Reporter|  Im talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
Michael|  Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? Whats going on?
