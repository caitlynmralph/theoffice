Dwight| Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Stanley| Thank you. 
Dwight| No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. 
Andy| Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? 
Dwight| Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Phyllis|  This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
Andy|  Thanks.
Dwight| Oh, dont mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.  
Dwight|  Good morning Michael.
Michael| Morning Dwight.
Dwight| Hungry?
Michael| No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didnt want hers.  Because I guess Im the only aphrodisiac she needs.   
Dwight|  Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.   
Michael| Well, yeah... 
Dwight|  Youre thinking of deer penis.
Michael| It worked.
Dwight|  Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.   Bagel?
Michael|  I dont mind if I do.
Dwight|  K. I brought cheese too.  
Michael| Im taking one for my lady friend.  
Dwight| Excellent.  
Michael| Brain food. Thank you very much.  
Dwight| Okay.  You owe me. 
Dwight| Cant a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so theyll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Dwight| Pam, would you care for a bagel? 
Pam| Oh, no thank you.
Dwight| Thats right.  Youre a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  Ill try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Pam|  I have an early lunch.
Pam|  Michaels been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I dont know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today hes planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
Erin|  These are amazing.  You took all these?
Ryan|  Ive always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Erin|  Oh just by like friends.  
Ryan|  Well heres what Ive been doing around here.   Its for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Helene|   Whoohoo! Pammy?
Pam| Hey!   Hey. Happy birthday.
Helene| Thank you. 
Michael|  My girls.  There they are. 
Michael|  Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  Itll cure all of your "Gee I dont know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I dont really see them together".  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.  
Angela|  Pam, arent you going to introduce us to Michaels girlfriend?
Pam|  I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Michael| Yeah-- 
Kevin| Hi.
Michael|  I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Helene| Wait a minute.   Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.  
Kelly| Oh my God I love it. 
Helene|  Tell her how you gave it to me.  
Michael| No, that wouldnt be-- 
Helene|  He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning.  What a nice way to wake up.
Michael|  Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.     
Kevin| Because of sex?
Michael| Hey-- 
Pam|  Kevin!
Michael|  Please, Kevin.  Youre fired.    Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Pam| Yes, lets go. 
Erin| Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say its urgent.    
Pam| Oh, you guys.  Just one second.   Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I dont think I can go to lunch.
Jim|  Oh man, thats crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Pam|  I know.  Isnt that always how it goes?
Jim|  Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  Ill talk to them. 
Pam| I want to handle it.
Jim|  Thats okay.  
Pam|  I feel like its-- 
Jim| Its my pleasure.  Hello?  Well thats great.   Turns out the paper was there all along.  
Creed|  Thank God.
Creed|  Somethings up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.  
Helene|  So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?
Pam|  Yeah-- its exciting.
Helene|  Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.  
Jim|  Pams sales are fine actually.
Michael|  Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldnt even be talking about business today.
Pam|  Thank you.
Michael|  Today is about family.
Pam|  Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didnt even blow it.  
Andy|  Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
Dwight|  Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Andy|  Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and shes polished right up, back up to her former glory.
Dwight| Wow-- 
Andy| Feel it against your cheek.
Dwight|  I will.  
Andy|  You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.  
Dwight|  Let me get that door for you--  
Andy| Whoa-- 
Dwight| There you go!
Andy|  Thank you very much.  Now Ive got it for you. 
Dwight|  Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, heres a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.  
Andy|  Is that right?  
Dwight| Observe. 
Andy| Huh.  
Dwight| Right?
Andy|  That really works.  
Dwight| Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.  
Andy|  Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.  
Dwight|   And that needs to be straight as an arrow. 
Andy| Whoa--  thank you very much.    Oh boy.
Dwight| Thank you very much for that.
Andy|   You are very welcome.  
Dwight|  Have a seat.  Allow me.
Andy|  Have a seat yourself.  
Dwight|  You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.  
Andy|  Not necessary.
Dwight|  No, no, no! 
Andy|  You didnt have to do that.
Dwight|  Andy is complicating things.  But Im not worried.  This will only up my game.  
Michael|  Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.
Hostess|  Welcome Scott family.  Itll be just a moment.  
Pam|  I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
Michael|  What table should we take?  So many to choose from.  
Jim| Wow.
Helene|  Oh my God!
Michael| What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
Pam|  Michael, you did all this? 
Michael|  Not about taking credit.  Lets just say we all did it.  
Helene|  Well, thank you.  All of you.
Michael|  Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.  
Helene|  Oh youll love it.  You can have my guide books.  I think Im done with those really long plane rides.  
Michael| Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.   
Pam| So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
Helene|  Sticking with 49.
Pam| 49 again? Thats nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.  
Michael|  Thats funny.
Helene|  Well, as long as youre running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one.  Lets see your six months pregnant, but youve only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
Jim| Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.  
Michael|  Youre 54 years old.  
Helene|  No.  Im 58.  
Michael|  Youre 58 years old?
Helene| Uh huh.
Michael| Congratulations.
Michael|  The only time you should care about a womans age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
Pam|  Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?  
Helene|  Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
Pam| Please be Grandma.
Jim| Definitely Grandma.
Pam|  I want you to be Grandma.  
Helene| Oh, Michael what do you think?  Grandma?
Michael|  That-- 
Pam|  Yay, Grandma!  
Michael| Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
Pam| Maybe.
Michael| Helene?
Helene|  Oh, oh no.  I dont think so.
Michael| I am.  Im definitely going to do it.  Ive already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
Helene| Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out.  It just-- doesnt interest me. 
Michael| So its a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  Its not anything you would have ever done.   
Helene|  Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now theres just other things Id rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming-- 
Michael|  Well theres no jumping in a triathlon.
Helene| Oh-- 
Michael|  Youre thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Helene|  No, no... 
Michael| Snowboarding?
Helene|  You want to go snowboarding? 
Michael| I might.
Helene|  Michael, what are you talking about?
Michael|   Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I dont know.
Michael| Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to. 
Andy|  Aye-yi-yi! 
Dwight| Whats going on in here?
Oscar| Andy bought lunch.
Dwight| Oh... no... really? 
Andy| Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Dwight|  There is no book.  Theres only a survival guide.  
Andy|  You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.  
Dwight| Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyones tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Michael| So we should get the check?
Pam| What about your gift Michael?
Michael| Oh, no, no, no. No.  Its stupid.  Youd hate it.  I hate it.  
Helene|  Im sure I wont.
Michael|  Yes you will.  
Pam|  He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.    
Helene|  Gimme.  Look at this wrapping paper.  Its got the word love on it in every language.
Pam| Aww-- 
Michael|  I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.  
Helene|   A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott.  For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.    
Michael|  Thats just an arbitrary title.
Helene| Ok, theres a penny.  Whats that from?
Jim| Penny for your thoughts.
Helene|  It was from the wishing well at the mall.  You threw it in.  I went back later, waded in and I found it.
Jim| Wow.
Pam| Thats amazing.
Michael|  Its not amazing... at all.  Its sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish wont come true, so that blows.  
Helene|    A poem!
Michael| Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Helene|   I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay... 
Jim|  Shel Silverstein.
Pam| Yeah.
Helene| Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.  
Pam|  Thats really nice Michael.  
Michel| I think it sucks.
Helene|  I think its wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
Michael|  Well, thats because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  Its a generational-- sort of gap between us.  
Helene|   God... its a scrapbook.
Pam|  Home run Michael.
Jim|  You set the bar so high.
Michael|  That was a bunt.  
Andy|  Whoa, whoa Dwight.  Im going to do this.  
Dwight|  Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
Andy|  No, I insist.
Dwight| No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.    
Andy|  Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
Dwight|  Dont worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Pam| Hey. Whered you go?
Michael| Oh, just went to the bathroom.
Pam|  And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Michael| I got thirsty. 
Pam| Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  Its time for cake.
Michael|  Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.  
Pam|  Cakes really good.  
Helene|  Oh, I know.  I love how they use butter cream frosting.
Michael|  Finish your cake, Helene.
Helene|  Hmmm?
Michael|  I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.  
Michael|  Helene I think youre a wonderful person and I-- God-- Ive enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pams feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.  
Pam|  Michael.  Michael ,its okay.
Michael|  No its not.  
Pam|  I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Michael|  Wow.  That just-- youve really grown.  
Pam| Well-- 
Michael|  Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  Ive never-- I dont know him.  Theres another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.  
Jim|  Okay, so-- 
Michael| And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.  
Pam| Michael.
Michael|  Its not my decision.  Its mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--   -- tility.
Helene|  I, um-- I got it.
Helene|  Im 58.  What am I supposed to do now?
Michael|  Well, hobbies-- 
Jim| Stop.
Andy|   Ahh.  
Dwight| Whats going on?
Andy|  Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
Dwight| Alright, move it.  
Andy|  What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Dwight| Oh yeah, youre going to owe me big time.
Andy| Its like a little envelope-- there you go.
Dwight| Got it.  To Dwight. Wha--   Starbucks gift card.  
Andy| Surprise!   Its from everybody.  $15 value.
Dwight|  Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.   Theyre mushrooms.  They dont get that high.
Michael|  Pamela Beesly Halpert-- 
Pam| What?
Michael| May I have a word with you in my office please?
Pam| I am working.
Michael| Well, this is a work related matter.  
Pam| Really?
Michael| Yes.
Pam| Really?
Michael| Yes.  Join me please, wont you?   I am going to give you a raise.  
Pam| Why?
Michael| Because of all the good work youve done.
Pam|  I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Michael|  Thats-- no, no-- its not about numbers, Pam.  Its about attitude.
Pam|  I have the worst attitude of any person here.  
Michael|  Do you want the raise or what?
Pam|  Yeah, Ill take it. 
Michael| Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.    And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.  
Pam|  Youre bribing me?
Michael| No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying dont-- unless I havent offered you enough... your face isnt changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pams brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or-- 
Pam|  I want to hit you.
Michael|  What?
Pam|  I want to hit you.  Ill do that.  
Michael|  Oh-- okay , what? I dont-- Are you kidding?
Pam| No.  Are you kidding?
Michael| Ye-- No.  Alright.  Ill take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just-- 
Pam|  No.  I dont think I can hit you in the office.  
Michael|  Okay.
Pam|  So, um... well do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  Im going to hit you as hard as I can.
Michael| Okay.
Pam| Okay.
Michael| Okay.  
Pam| See you then.
Michael|  See you.
Ryan| Hey.
Michael| Hey.
Ryan|  Quick question.  
Kelly| Yeah.
Ryan| Are you scared?
Michael| Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking-- 
Ryan|  We heard about the punch.  
Michael| What punch?
Kelly|  Pam.  Shes going to punch the crap out of your face after work.   
Michael| Im pretty sure we said slap.  
Kelly| No, its a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
Ryan|  Im getting concerned that you dont seem to understand whats going to happen.  Do you?
Michael| I-- mmm-- Im good.
Ryan|  alright.  See you there.
Michael|  Hey.
Jim|  Hey.
Michael| Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
Jim| Inappropriate.
Michael| I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Jim|  All the time.  
Michael| Really?
Jim| Yeah.
Michael| She strong?
Jim| She wants it bad Michael.
Michael| Can you stop this?
Jim|  I can.
Michael| Okay.  
Jim|  And I dont support her choice to hit you.  
Michael| I dont either.
Jim|  But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.  
Michael| Mmm-hmm.  I know.  
Jim|  I just need some time.
Michael| You gotta do something-- 
Jim|  I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Michael| How much time do you think youll need?
Jim| No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.  
Michael| Come on, man!
Toby| Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Pam| Oh... 
Toby|  I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure its off company property, right?
Pam|  Right.  
Toby|  Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Pam| Okay.
Toby|  Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and theres a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.   Pow!
Pam|  Okay wait-- its-- youre saying it comes from the foot.
Toby| Yes.  
Pam| Okay. 
Toby| Yes.
Pam| Wow!
Toby| Okay.
Meredith|  Hey everybody, hes not in the mens room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.  
Kevin|  My moneys on Pam.
Oscar|  Its not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Kevin|  Michael could win.
Oscar|  How?  He cant hit back.  
Kevin|  Why cant you just agree with me sometimes? 
Michael| Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdos pay dominatrixs hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  Im scared Im gonna love it.   Lets do this.  
Michael| Its okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
Kevin|  Were here for the show, Michael.  
Michael| Youre just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
Kelly|  It has almost no calories.  
Pam|  Are you ready?
Michael| Yes.  
Pam|  You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Michael|  I know.  Okay.  Alright.   Oh-- God!
Pam| Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Angela|  Put your hands in your pockets.
Michael| Okay!  Pam, Pam-- Im really sorry.  Im sorry.  
Pam|  What are you sorry for?
Michael| So many things.  I dont know.  Its hard to choose.  
Pam|  How about for dating my mom?
Michael| Maybe that-- 
Pam|  And dumping her on her birthday.
Michael| Yes.
Pam|  Okay-- just-- dont ever date a member of my family again.  
Michael|  Okay.  I promise.   For the record your mom came on to me.   
Phyllis|  Holy crap.
Pam|  Are you okay?
Michael| No!
Pam|  Youre okay.
Jim|  Feel better?
Pam| No.  You were right.
Dwight|  Wait, why are you limping?
Michael|  I dont know.
Dwight|  Lets get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Michael| As I watched Pams big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesnt sound like much, but its enough for me.
Michael| Ahh... 
Dwight|  Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Michael| Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.    
Dwight|  Fire Jim.
Michael|  No.
Dwight| Im cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
Michael| What are you talking about-- 
Dwight| Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.  
Michael|  Forget that.
Dwight|  Can I have an office?
Michael|  No.
Dwight|  You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  Its worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  Im keeping it.  
Michael|  Oh that feels better.
