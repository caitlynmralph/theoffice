Michael |Oh, new record!
Dwight |Okay.
Michael |Oh, what did you do today?
Jim |I made a sale.
Michael |Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
Meredith |What do we get if we do em?
Michael |My respect.  Okay, Ill make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Dwight |And one girl push-up.
Michael |Gets to go home.  Ooh! I say dance, they say how high? Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high.  Disqualified!
Angela |Ow!

Michael | Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Phyllis |Ten...
Michael |Yeah, Im betting one more.
Phyllis |Eleven, wow!
Michael |Good.
Everyone | Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...
Michael |Alright, alright. 
Oscar |Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Michael |Well, its not exactly fair. Hes got all of his weight thats helping him go down.
Dwight |25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Phyllis |One more, one more! 
Oscar |You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Stanley |Excuse me.
Jim |Wow. 
Oscar |Hey. Matt, right?
Matt |Hey, Oscar. Youre here early. 
Oscar |I always come in at 7. 
Warehouse Guy |No, you dont.
Oscar |Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Matt |I dont know. Im free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
Oscar |Yeah.
Oscar |Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there.  Just a couple of hours to kill before work. 
Darryl |Hey, whats up?
Oscar |Hey, nice office.
Darryl |Thanks, its cool. So...
Oscar |You know what we havent done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Darryl |Has that ever happened? Ever?
Oscar |Didnt we? I think we did.
Darryl |You want me to invite Matt?
Oscar |Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
Darryl |Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. 
Oscar |So happy hour.
Darryl |Happy hour. My pleasure.
Oscar |All right.
Oscar |So what do you think?
Phyllis |Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV Id like to try. Ill ask Bob.
Phyllis |Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats em up. What?
Andy |A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. 
Jim |I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pams at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in. 
Andy |Oh, baloney. 
Jim |Good one.
Andy |Ring her up. 
Jim |Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Jim |I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Jim |So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
Pam | Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Andy |Ha! Knew it!
Pam | Its been so long since Ive been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanleys going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Jim |I did not see this coming.
Andy |Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto.  Are you going later?
Erin |Sure, if you are. 
Andy |Yes.
Erin |Talk to me that way again, and Ill cut your face off. 
Andy |Whoa. 
Andy |We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but were kinda keeping it quiet for now cause its still kind of a new thing. Its a little delicate, and we just dont want all the drama.
Erin |Exactly.
Andy |Yeah, cause when everyone knows-  Thats actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Erin |Quiet.
Andy |Hey, boss man. 
Michael |Yes?
Andy |A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Michael |Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. 
Andy |Im sorry, I meant later.
Michael |Ok, yes. Sure. 
Andy |For happy hour?
Michael |No, I got that.
Andy |Trying to get a head count.
Michael |I am in.
Andy |All right, yes! Its a deal.
Michael |Its a deal.
Pam |Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie. 
Jim |Okay.
Pam |I want her to meet Michael.
Jim |Why?
Pam |Theyre both single, I have a sense they might-
Jim |Youve been gone for a long time.
Pam |It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Kevin |Yeah! 
Pam |Hey, how are you?
Kevin |Oh, I missed you so much.
Pam |Aw!
Kevin |Yeah! 
Pam |Yeah!
Kevin |Waaah! 
Kevin |When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-whats fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Michael |Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! 
Jim |Easy.
Michael |Its not a birthday, its not a good-bye party...
Jim |Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Michael |Sucks to be you.
Jim |Would you like to be our fourth?
Michael |That would be sublime.
Jim |All right.
Darryl |So, the guy shows me the deck hes built. And Im like, Ill call this a deck if itll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.  It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Pam |Hey, Michael.
Michael |Yes.
Pam |This is my friend Julie.
Michael |Hello, how are you?
Julie |Good. Hi.
Michael |What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? 
Pam |Julie laughs at everything.
Julie |So you work with Pam and Jim?
Michael |Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
Julie | I should hope not.
Michael |No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
Isabel |Hey. 
Pam |Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Isabel |Of course.
Pam |You want to play pool?
Isabel |Um, Im gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
Pam |Ok.
Angela |And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Dwight |Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isnt Isabel.
Isabel |Mm-hmm.
Dwight |Whats a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Isabel |A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
Dwight |Ooh, I love repartee.
Isabel |Do you?
Dwight |Usually means theres a battle scene coming. 
Michael |So, what do you do?
Julie |I am an ESL teacher. 
Michael |Really? 
Julie |Yeah.
Michael |See, I didnt think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Julie |Are you thinking that I said ESP?
Michael |Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome. 
Julie |I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesnt act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, wed never get anything done. 
Jim |So what do you think?
Michael |About what?
Jim |About Julie?
Michael |Shes nice. 
Jim |Yeah. 
Michael |Yeah.
Jim |So you like her?
Michael |Uh, yeah, sure.
Jim |So Pam was right?
Michael |About what?
Jim |About you two hitting it off. 
Michael | Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. 
Hide |My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.
Oscar |I know.
Pam |Hey, Michael, where have you been? 
Jim |Hey, youre supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Pam |Why are you wearing a hat now?
Michael |Guys, come on, Im on a date. Let me do my thang.
Michael |Hi, Im date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? 
Jim |You want to just make a run for it?
Pam |Maybe.
Kevin |Waaaah!  Waaaaah! Mommy!
Jim |What is happening?
Andy |Whoa! What is crackin?
Ryan |Guys, one second.  
Kelly |Were focusing, were focusing, we cant talk.
Erin |Whats this game?
Ryan |One second.
Andy |Yeah, how do you play?
Ryan |Guys, guys, guys, please.  Ok, all right, its all yours now.
Kelly |Only three tickets. 
Ryan |If we save em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Kelly |Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. 
Ryan |I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Andy |Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Erin |Oh I know. 
Andy |Theyd be like, whats up with those two?
Erin |Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.
Andy |Did we miss the wedding? Um, I got it-Ill do this, and you play the racing game, and then well switch.
Erin |Yes, okay. Yeah, thats smart. 
Andy |No drama. Ok.
Isabel |Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
Dwight |Any brothers or sisters?
Isabel |Three brothers.
Dwight |Really?
Isabel |Two are in the Marines, ones a cop.
Dwight |Vegetarian?
Isabel |No. I love meat.
Dwight |Whats your blood type?
Isabel |O-negative. Universal donor.
Dwight |Universal donor.  
Dwight |Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Michael |Hey, guys, guys, guys.  Watch this. Ready?
Julie |What are you doing?
Michael |Im tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Jim |Michael, you dont have to do this.
Michael | Wow. Oh, wow, that was close. 
Michael |I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers. 
Phyllis |Hey, you two having fun?
Andy |Did you tell them? 
Erin |No.
Andy |This is exactly what I dont want, the drama. I dont want the drama!
Erin |I get it.
Isabel | You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
Dwight |Whacking moles. Hit em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Isabel |Whack!
Dwight |Extend the fingers more.
Isabel |Whack!
Dwight |Good.
Angela |This looks like a hoot.
Dwight |Hey, monkey, how you doing?
Angela |Whack.
Dwight |Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Angela |Okay.
Dwight |Look, Ive been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you dont need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
Angela |Its no worry. 
Dwight |Its just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Angela |I could see enjoying that.
Dwight |No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. Youre off the hook.
Angela |But we signed the contract.
Dwight |Dissolved. Dont worry, youre free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Angela |We both-you didnt dup-
Jim | Wow. Maybe we should tell her that hes not normally like this.
Pam |Maybe it should come from a man.
Jim |Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Bar Manager |Hello.
Michael |Hello.
Bar Manager |Hi. 
Michael |Hi.
Bar Manager |You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
Michael |Yeah, why dont you send the bill to 23 I Dont Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Pam |Hey, Michael, why dont you just get down.
Michael |Hey, she can tell Im on a date, right? Right? Im just having fun.
Bar Manager |Ted, are we having fun?
Michael |Really? You told on me. Thats lame.
Bouncer |We got a problem?
Michael |Yes. Homelessness. What?
Bar Manager |All right, go.
Michael |Where?
Bar Manager |Get out. Now.
Michael |Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. Im just kidding around. Im sorry. 
Pam |Ok, um, why dont we just finish the game? Michael, its your shot.
Michael |She cant talk to us that way.
Pam |You guys are stripes, I think...
Michael |You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Jim |It stopped.
Michael |Well, I am starting it again!
Pam |Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Michael |Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and Im gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize. 
Bar Manager |Then I am sorry that I didnt kick you out.
Michael |I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Bar Manager |Well, uh, Im the manager here, sir. 
Michael |Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I dont see that from you. 
Bar Manager |Is that how you do it?
Michael |Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
Bar Manager |Really? How much have you written?
Michael |Ive written all of it... in my head.
Bar Manager |Oh. 
Michael |If youre really interested, its called Somehow I Manage and theres going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Bar Manager |Huh. Have you read Lee Iacoccas? Its a classic.
Michael |Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
Bar Manager |Dude, tonight! Youre not going to want to put it down. Its gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.
Michael |I own a Chrysler.
Bar Manager |Shut up.
Michael |No, you shut up.
Bar Manager |Whats your drink?
Michael |Grenadine.
Bar Manager |What? 
Andy |We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
Erin |Okay.
Andy | Hi.
Girl at table |Hi.
Andy |I dont normally do this, but...
Girl at table |Do what?
Andy |Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
Erin | Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
Andy | What are you doing?
Erin |What we said to do. 
Andy |We didnt say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Erin |I was flirting with a man.
Andy |Get in here.  Where did you learn to talk like that?
Erin |The movies. I dont know. 
Andy |Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
Michael |I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. 
Bar Manager |You have a card?
Michael |I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
Bar Manager |Stanley Hudson?
Michael |No, no.
Bar Manager |Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudsons in here.
Michael |No, its Michael Scott.
Bar Manager |Michael Scott?
Michael |He is I.
Bar Manager |You just won yourself a lunch.
Michael |Oh, hey guys. 
Julie |I think Im gonna go.
Pam |Really?
Julie |Yeah.
Pam |Im sorry, hes not usually like that.
Julie |Whats he usually like?
Pam |Hes more, just... like... you can go.
Julie |Yeah.
Jim |All right. 
Pam |Okay. Bye. 
Jim |See ya. Nice girl.
Pam |Yeah.
Michael |Hey, Julie! You having fun? 
Bar Manager |So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? Youre gonna want to come in on a day that Im working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.
Darryl |Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dudes life story? Its amazing, right?
Oscar |I couldnt understand a word he said.
Darryl |Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matts an okay dude, but hes a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Oscar |Maybe youre right. I should count myself lucky. 
Matt |Hey, whats up?
Oscar |There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Matt |Anyone up for some hoops?
Oscar |Sure. Hoops!
Matt |Lets do it.
Oscar |Hoop it up, right.
Andy |This is not what I want my relationship to look like. 
Andy | Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and Ive been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Andy |You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
Erin | You love drama.
Andy |I know, I do, right? Im a total drama queen.
Dwight |With this move, he cant get you. 
Isabel |Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
Dwight |Oh, please. I wish hed come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Angela |Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Dwight |Sh-what?
Angela |You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Dwight |No, no, no.  Blah blah blah blah!
Angela |For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin. 
Isabel |What are you talking about?
Dwight |What are you-
Angela |Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. 
Dwight |Angela...
Angela |Did he not tell you that?
Dwight |Youre really putting me in an awkward position here.
Angela |Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Dwight |Angela, not here!
Angela |Dwight?
Isabel |Whack! 
Angela |Youll see me in small claims court!
Dwight |You are an impressive specimen.
Isabel |Thank you. 
Kelly | Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldnt give me a refill.
Pam |Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Jim |You all right?
Pam |Okay, we have to get home.
Kevin |Yeah!
Michael |Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. 
Jim |Actually, you didnt.
Pam |Not at all.
Michael |I think I did. But I cant take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me. 
Darryl |Tell em your story, Hide.
Hide |In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die. Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No English,  no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret  I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. The best!
