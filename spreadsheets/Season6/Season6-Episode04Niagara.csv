Pam| Im sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Jim| We would really appreciate it.
Dwight| Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed. Its amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. Its so bad ass.
Pam| Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
Phyllis| Now this is getting ridiculous.
Dwight| Oh, gee, Im sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Meredith| All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and Im not stopping for anyone.
Pam| I dont think Im asking for too much. I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Andy|  Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  
Michael|  What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
Jim| It is really special.
Pam| Yeah, but arent you supposed to do that to our... no. Its great.
Michael| Its just a really important day for me.
Jim| Well, congrats.
Michael| Thanks.
Erin| Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and well get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Jim| Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the dont column.
Kevin| So... youre going to provide them, then?
Jim| No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Kevin| What the hell?
Dwight| Come on. Youve got to be kidding me.
Pam| Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Jim| Absolutely. Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Angela| Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Pam| Well, were thinking of my grandmother who we havent told and is very old-fashioned.
Angela| Well, youre lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Jim| Thats nice.
Pam| You know, Angela, you dont have to come to the wedding.
Angela| Really, Pam... 
Michael| Yes she does. Yes she does. Were all gonna go and were gonna have a good time. 
Angela| Ow! He pinched me!
Michael| No.
Pam| Next time were all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Dwight| Well see.
Pam| Thank you, Dwight.
Jim| Good-bye.
Pam| See you later. 
Michael| And, hey, dont embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
Andy| What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. 
Michael| Dont. Dont. Dont. You stole my joke. Dont steal my joke.
Andy| No... I didnt steal your joke.
Michael| Yes. I said that yesterday.
Dwight| But you can say that about anything.
Michael| Dwight... 
Dwight| What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
Kevin| Oh yeah.
Michael| No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, thats my joke.
Dwight| Its easy. Thats what Im saying.
Michael| This is what Im talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
Michael| Pam and Jims wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
Dwight| I stole the guest list from Jims desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Michael| Get out of here.
Dwight| Yes.
Michael| Oh, my God, Dwight.
Dwight| For instance, Pams cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Michael| Theres... a name.
Dwight| Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Michael| Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
Dwight| Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Micheal| Ok.
Dwight| She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Michael| Is that all you have on her?
Dwight| Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Michael| Youre an idiot.
Kevin| People dont think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but Im going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair.  Its the hair--  Ok. Ok. Im going.  God.
Andy|  Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  Its like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Kelly| This is so much cooler. We feel like werre in a limo and youre our driver.
Andy| Mmm-hmm. Erin?
Erin| Oh no. That wouldnt be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Andy| Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smells like my mom.
Pam|  Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
Jim| Yeah?
Pam| She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
Jim| Oh, wow. Thats cool.
Pam| Yeah.
Jim|  Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now thats in my brain forever.
Pam| Oh.
Jim| Lousy Picture.
Pam| We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Michael|  Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Dwight| What? No way!
Michael| Those glasses are super dark.
Dwight| Oh. God.
Michael| Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
Dwight| You know what? I made you a cd...
Michael| You did?
Dwight| Mmm-hmm.
Michael| That was nice of you.
Dwight| This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Michael| Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
Dwight| Youre gonna like this.  "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. Whats next?, youre probably wondering. Dont be scared of youre night in heaven--" 
Michael| Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Dwight| Yeah. Its practical.
Michael| No. No. Thats not how it works.
Jim| Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. Its really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Front Desk Clerk| Halpert... 
Jim| And Beesly. Tonight were in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Front Desk Clerk| Great.
Jim| I know. Were pretty excited, too.
Pam| Can we take a look at the suite now?
Front Desk Clerk| Oh, Im sorry. Somebody just checked in.
Pam| Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Front Desk Clerk| Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there.
Andy| Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. Ill break in the bed. 
Jim| I dont like that.
Pam| Im gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Michael| Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
Front Desk Clerk| One moment while I check.
Dwight| The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Michael| Mmm-hmm.
Front Desk Clerk| Im sorry, sir, but Im not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?
Michael| I dont have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
Front Desk Clerk| Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. Im afraid were all sold out.
Dwight| Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Front Desk Clerk| Yes. Schrute.
Dwight| And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Front Desk Clerk| Sure. No problem.
Dwight| Ok.
Front Desk Clerk| Heres your key, Mr. Schrute.
Michael| Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
Dwight| No way. What if I meet someone?
Michael| Im staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
Dwight| No. No.
Michael| I would do the same for you.
Dwight| You would?
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Really?
Michael| Yes... just go--
Dwight| Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
Michael| Oh. Thank God.
Dwight| Oh no. Now that I dont have a room, can I stay with you?
Michael| Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you cant. And Ill tell you why.
Dwight| Please?
Michael| If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, shes going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
Dwight| Mmm-hmm.
Michael| Ok.
Dwight| Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Michael| I dont have a room?
Dwight| No you do not.
Michael| Ok. Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.
Dwight| It worked.
Michael| Jerk.
Michael| When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we dont know what happens because that story hasnt been told yet.
Stanley| Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
Michael| Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Stanley| Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
Michael| Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
Stanley| I got one queen size bed.
Michael| You... are... kidding me.
Stanley| A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
Michael| Im not a physics major, Stanley. Im just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
Erin| Oh. Gross.
Kelly| Blow my brains out.
Michael| Thats rude.
Toby| Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
Michael| You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
Mr. Halpert| So, which one is Pams grandma?
Pam| Oh, Mema? Shes the one in the teal suit. Shes the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
Jim| Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
Mr. Halpert| No.
Michael| Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shes very conservative. So, mums the word.
Jim| Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
Mr. Halpert| Oh.
Michael| How ya doin?
Mr. Halpert| Hi.
Michael| Nice to meet you.
Mr. Halpert| Nice to meet you.
Michael| Whos doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
Jim| Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because its just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Michael| That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
Jim| Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Michael| Didnt move my lips.
Pam| Hey, Mema.
Mema| I wasnt sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parents divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.
Pam| Oh. Thank you... but nobodys perfect.
Mema| Well... I wouldnt care to live if I thought that.
Jim| Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Mr. Beesly| Id like you to meet Christy Kelly.
Jim| Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Mr. Beesly|  No no. Shes my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
Dwight| From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. Its all in the report.
Little Girl| Why would they make the bad man a boss if youre so much smarter?
Dwight| Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss mans butt.
Kids| Ewwww!
Dwight| Thats right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Pam| Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. Shes also my maid of honor.
Oscar| Pleased to meet you.
Penny| Im sorry, its Kevin. I thought it was Gil?
Kevin| She thought I was your boyfriend.
Oscar| You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Pam| Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
Oscar| Him? Him?
Kevin| Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Penny| Im sorry.
Kevin| Im not gay. Im Kevin.
Penny| Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Kevin| Yes.
Oscar| You owe me and apology.
Penny| Im so sorry.
Kevin| Are you seeing anyone right now?
Pam| She has a boyfriend. Hes out of town.
Kevin| Cool.
Ryan|  I was the youngest VP in the company history.
Meredith| More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Ryan| Um... also--
Andy| How did Meredith get put at the young peoples table?
Kevin| She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Andy| What? Youre kid-- Thats-- Youre--
Isabel| Jim and Pam, I cant tell you how happy I am to be here.
Michael| Head table, where I belong.
Dwight| Its just for family.
Michael| Well, whos that one?
Dwight| Isabel Poreba. Oh, Ive got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Michael| What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
Dwight| Thats a very good record.
Pete| Alright, so Ill be like, Youre so sweet guys and so kind.
Tom| Thats when Ill do the face, like-
Pete| Like, What? What?. And then well just give him a little punch in the back and--
Tom| A noogie?
Pete| You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Michael| They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
Tom| Pam, youve got the greatest smile and youre body is really fine.
Pete| Smoking.
Tom| Hoping itll make our wives take it up a notch.
Pete| A little mo cardio.
Michael| Thats not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasnt gonna make a toast and Im not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? Im so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car. Thats not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
Dwight| Knight Rider.
Michael| Thats a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
Dwight| No.
Michael| Thats not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. 
Dwight| Very smart.
Michael| And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesnt have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
Jim| No.
Michael| Yeah. Go ahead.
Jim| Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Pete| Douche.
Jim| Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, cant take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, dont get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didnt need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Pam| Like... a year.
Jim| Ive been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time thats all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if youd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Mema| Whats obvious? Why cant Pam drink?
Jim| Pam cant drink? I didnt-- I shouldnt have said that. I dont know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldnt. She shouldnt because shes an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. Thats not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pams pregnant.
Michael|  Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, theyre living together, theyre having lots of consentual sex--
Mema| They were living together?
Michael| Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You cant expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, its just a different sensation.
Jim| Michael.
Michael| When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say its not different, but its a different sensation.
Jim| Oh, my God. Please.
Michael| When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. Its not necessarily different for the woman--
Pam| Michael.
Michael| ...but its different for the-- ok. Ok.
Pam| Michael. Stop.
Michael| Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
Jim| Alright.
Michael| Jim.
Jim| To waiting.
Everyone|  To waiting.
Mema| I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldnt turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, How could they pick such a hotel? Hmmm. Now I know.
Pam| Mema.
Michael| That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
Jim| I cant believe it was me.
Michael| I know. I cant believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
Jim| Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Michael| I have not found that to be the case.
Pam| Hey, smooth guys.
Jim| Im so sorry.
Michael| Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Pam| Memas not coming to the wedding. Shes leaving tomorrow morning.
Jim| Oh, my God. Are you serious?
Michael| Theres gonna be a free room?
Michael| Hi, Mema. Its Michael.
Mema| Oh. Youre that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.
Michael| Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
Michael| I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks shes better than everybody.
Mema| I want to go to bed but I cant. I cant turn that television off.
Michael| Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. 
Mema| Oh. Thank you.
Michael| Youre welcome.
Mema| It was that horrible Charlie Rose.
Michael| Oh. Isnt he terrible? May I? Heres the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. Its not 1890 anymore. Its modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. Thats part of life.
Mema| People are like cats and dogs these days.
Michael| Exactly.
Mema| This used to be such a great country.
Michael| I know.
Mema| I dont know what happened to it.
Michael| Theyre gonna name the baby after you, you know. Theyre gonna call it Mema.
Mema| You mean, Sylvia.
Michael| Yes, and if its a boy they will call it Sylvio.
Andy| Partay. Room 639.
Kevin| Yes!
Andy| Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
Kevin| That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Andy| Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Andy| No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
Andy| If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But dont tell anyone that I said that, cause I want them to come.
Angela| And where do you think youre going?
Pam| I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Angela| Well, why dont I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Pam| I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Angela| Mmm-hmm. Ok. Ill go with you. Come on.
Pam|  Nevermind.
Angela| Are you sure?
Pam| Yeah.
Angela| Itll be fun.
Pam| No.
Michael| What are you wearing?
Dwight| What? Its a casual, social outfit.
Michael| Looks like youre going to a fish fry, Dwight.
Dwight| No. Theyre howling at the moon. Its suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
Michael| Ok.  Thats not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Lets go. 
Kevin| Its a good idea.
Oscar| Its not a good idea. Theres no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Kevin| Yeah. But thats easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
Dwight| Im just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Michael| Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. Its not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
Isabel| Wait. Youre worried about your horses? Thats cool. How many horses do you have?
Dwight| Nine and three-quarters.
Dwight| I invented a device called Burger on the Go. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Malls considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, No.
Michael|  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Dwight| Michael.
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Drop this one. Abort.
Michael| Why?
Dwight| I found twins.
Michael| Oh, my God. Twins. Im sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
Dwight| Arent they magnificent?
Michael| Theyre men, Dwight.
Dwight| I love finding a good set of twins.
Michael| Something is wrong with you.
Erin|  Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Andy| You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
Kelly| Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Andy| How about a little bit of this.
Erin| Oh yeah. What else you got?
Kevin| What else you got?
Andy| Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! 
Erin| What else you got?
Kevin| Its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. Pams here.  Pam? 
Andy| I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
Pam| What?
Andy| I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
Pam| Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Andy|  Everyone else is too drunk.  Just dont let me die here.
Pam|  Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
Jim|  What?
Pam| He tore his scrotum dancing.  
Jim|  What?
Pam| He is in my room icing his balls.  
Jim|  What?
Pam| Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Jim| Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but Im pretty certain Im completely wasted.
Pam|  Your brothers took you out drinking?  
Jim| Uh...  
Michael|   Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.  
Pam| Thats Michael.  Youre out with Michael?
Jim|  And Dwight.
Dwight|  Hey-O!
Jim| Pam, it just happened.  
Pam| Okay, fine.  Ill take him.
Jim| I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
Michael|  I love you! 
Pam| Are you pushing me off the phone?
Jim| No. Lets talk for a long time.
Pam| Goodbye. 
Michael| Mmm!  Its after midnight. 
Michael and Dwight|  Youre married.  Hes married!
Dwight| Congratulations.
Jim| Thats not how that works.
Dwight| Oh my goodness.
Michael| Oh my God.  Youre not going to be able to talk back.
Dwight|  Youll have Pam to answer to.
Michael|  Shell be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "And... and clip my toenails."
Dwight| "Jim... hey why dont you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV."
Michael|  Now you sound like Kermit.  
Andy|  Are you sure this is the right way?
Pam|  Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
Andy| Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
Pam|  Look, Im not the one who asked you to do a split when youve never done one before.  
Andy|  I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
Pam| My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  Thats my job.
Andy|  Well its also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--  
Andy|  Ow, ow!
Andy|  I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
Pam| Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?  
Andy| No.  No that was real.
Michael|  Why dont you take a picture.  Itll last longer.  God.  Cant I get a little privacy? 
Hotel Employee|  Good morning.  How can I help you?
Kevin|  I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they havent been returned yet.
Hotel Employee| You  must be Mr. Malone.  One moment please.  
Kevin| Thank you.
Hotel Employee|  Sir.  Its the man with the shoes.
Hotel Manager| Mr. Malone.  Your shoes are gone.  
Kevin| They were stolen?
Hotel Manager| No. Destroyed. 
Kevin| What?
Hotel Manager| The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him.  I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away.  Incinerated actually.  
Kevin|  But that was my only pair of shoes.  
Hotel Manager| It became a safety issue, sir.  
Kevin|  Well... well damn-it.  
Hotel Employee| I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
Kevin|  Okay.
Dwight|   You have everything?
Isabel|  Hmm-hmm.  
Dwight| Cell phone?  Charger?
Isabel|  Yeah.  So you sure you dont want breakfast?  Its the most important meal of the day.
Dwight|  It really is.  Im not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldnt want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.  
Isabel|  Thats really sweet, Dwight.  So Ill see you at the wedding?
Dwight| You know it.
Isabel| K.    
Dwight|  Okay, get out of here.
Isabel| Bye.  
Dwight| Okay.
Michael|  Hey, good morning.   Its about damn time.  I havent gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.    Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
Dwight|  Really?  I hadnt noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.  
Michael|   How can you eat like that?
Dwight|  Im ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Michael|  Yeah, Im hungry, but Im not going to make a pig out of myself.
Dwight|  Hey, what was she like?
Michael|  She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Dwight|  Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Michael| She was from Europe.
Dwight|  No kidding.
Michael| Uh-huh.  
Dwight|  I bet she had hairy armpits.
Michael| No. 
Dwight| Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesnt think this is going anywhere.  
Michael| Wait a second.  Youre not into her?  Are you kidding me?  
Dwight| No.
Michael|  Shes Pams best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
Dwight| Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Michael|  No... youre crazy.  
Dwight|  Look.  Shes a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  Shes a bumpkin.  Pass.  
Michael|  Shes-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of peoples teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure theyre not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--
Dwight|  You should ask her out.  
Michael|    I already have my European girlfriend.  
Stanley|  If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Phyllis|  Thats funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. 
Angela|  Oh my God.  
Oscar| Oh... 
Kevin| Oscar.  Angela.
Erin|  Are you in a lot of pain?
Andy|  Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.  
Erin|  People say you cry all the time.  
Andy|  Well thats not--
Meredith|  Crotch injuries are the worst.  You dont need to tell me.  
Andy|  I wasnt telling you.
Meredith|  Is there still something there?
Andy|  Excuse me?
Meredith|  It didnt get torn off?
Andy|  No, it didnt--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?  
Jim|  I may have told some people that.  Im nervous.  Im about to get married.  
Erin|  If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.  
Andy|  It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
Michael| Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.    And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.  
Dwight|  I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.  
Penny| Is it zipping over your belly? Dont squish the baby.
Pam| Thank you weirdo.  
Pams mom|  everybody see Kristies stupid blonde extensions?  Its like they were made from a plastic broom.  
Pam|  Okay, here I come.   
Pams mom|  Oh darling!  You look beautiful.
Pam|  Thanks mom.  
Pams mom|  Oh, I hope he deserves you.  
Pam|  He does.
Pams mom|  Are you sure?  Remember you dont have to do this.  You dont.
Penny| Mom, youre totally projecting.  Youre being a drag.
Pam|  Yes. Thank you, mom.
Isabel|  Hey, Im going to go outside and talk to Dwight.  
Pam| Okay great.   Yeah, Ill see you in a second.   Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no!
Jim|  Hey! 
Pam| Can you come here please?
Jim|  Is this allowed?
Pam| No.  No, but Im allowing it.  Just come here.
Dwight|   That was an intelligent comment.  
Isabel| Hello stranger.  How do I look?
Dwight| Oh.  Fine.  Isabel,  nice to see you.  What do you want?  
Isabel| Um...  nothing.  Anymore.
Dwight|  So, uh tell me again the difference between Filenes and Filenes basement.  
Michael|  Hey, hey... Hes not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
Isabel|  Im standing.  Im a bridesmaid.
Michael| Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
Pam| Hey.
Jim|  Wow.  You look--
Pam| Terrible.
Jim|  So beautiful.  Hey--
Pam| My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and Im five months pregnant that Im not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Jim|  Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, youre so pretty.
Pam|  Thank you.  
Jim| And who cares?  Its a stupid veil, right?
Pam|  No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- 
Jim| There.  Now were even.  
Pam|  Everyones driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andys scrotum.   And my mom wont stop freaking out about my dads new girlfriend.   This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?   
Phyllis|  I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldnt be a good wife.  
Angela| Yes.
Oscar|   What are you doing?
Kevin|  Im trying to decide if I have time to pee.  
Oscar|  How long do you take to pee?
Kevin|  The peeing is fast, Oscar.  Its getting my tie back on.  
Michael|   Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  Youre a mom.  I just figured you might have--
Pams mom| Oh, yeah--
Michael| Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Pams mom| No.
Michael| Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?  
Pams mom| Oh, no, no, no.  Thats okay.  I was just--Ive had a very rough weekend.
Michael|  Im sorry.  Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.  
Erin|  Do you think they canceled the wedding?  
Angela| Relax.  Youll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970s key party.  
Michael|  my weekend was bad so far.
Pams mom| Oh--
Michael|  I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
Pams mom| Oh that sounds awful.
Michael| And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.  
Pams mom| Oh--
Michael|  It is a terrible year for love.
Pams mom| Yeah.  Guess it is.
Michael|  Im thinking about having my sperm frozen.
Tom Halpert|  Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?  
Michel| Um, yeah.
Tom| Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
Pete Halpert|  Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.  
Michael| Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually.   There you go.  Use it in good health.  
Tom and Pete|   Yes!
Meredith| Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?  
Stanley|  Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?  
Kevin|  Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Stanley| No.  
Kevin|  Who would want it?
Oscar|  Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.  
Dwight|  Toby.
Toby|  What?
Dwight|  Id like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Toby|  
Dwight|   Crap.    Come here you.
Toby|  Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  
Pams dad|  Hey.  What happened? 
Ryan|  Where were you guys?  Do you know how long Ive been waiting here? 
Jim|  Well we are here now, so lets just--
Michael|   Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?  
Jim|  You look great.
Pam|  You look great.  
Tom|   Wear a tie much?
Penny|   I begged them not to.
Pam|  Mm-hmm.
Penny|  I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.
Pam|  Yes I did.
Penny|  Im sorry.
Pam|   Go ahead.  I think its your turn.
Penny|  Wait, what happened?  Youre okay with this?  
Pam|  Yeah, Im okay.
Penny| Okay then! 
Michael| Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
Pam| Saw it. 
Jim|  I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew wed need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.  
Kevin|  What an awesome party.  The best wedding Ive ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.    Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I cant even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
