Erin| Theyre back!
Kevin| Oooh yeah...  Jim and Pam!
Kelly| How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Jim| It was.
Pam| It really was. 
Jim| Really was.
Kelly|  Im so happy for you... 
Jim| Puerto Rico was awesome.
Pam| Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. 
Jim|  Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh.
Pam|  Frank and beans!
Michael| Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
Dwight| Yeah!
Michael| Is someone there? I cant see you because Im blind.
Dwight| Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
Michael|  It is?
Dwight| Yeah... 
Michael| Theyre back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! 
Jim| Nope.
Michael| And oh, Jim... 
Pam| Hi, Michael.
Michael| Oh, I havent see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
Michael| Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character Ive been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. 
Meredith| So whatd you bring us?
Pam| Some candy.
Meredith| What else?
Pam| Thats it. 
Meredith| Oh, cause you spent so much on the wedding. 
Michael| 
Pam| Its good to be home.
Dwight| This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Jim| Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Dwight| Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. Its not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I dont care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so Id just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!
Jim| Wow, thats... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. 
Dwight|  Youre welcome! 
Dwight| I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. 
Dwight| Im sorry to have been bugging you all these years. 
Jim| Its a real handsome duck. 
Dwight| Mallard. Okay, Ill get out of your hair. 
Pam| Hey!
Erin| Hi!
Pam| Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy. 
Erin| Coco Leche! Thats my favorite!
Pam| Awesome! Ill leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it. 
Erin| Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Pam|  I think itll be okay.
Erin|  I think it will too, but Ill just check with him, though.
Pam| Great.
Erin| Oops, sorry.  Oops. 
Michael| I have recently taken a lover. 
Jim| Well, thats great. Congratulations. Whos the lucky lady?
Michael| Pams mom.
Jim| What?
Michael| Pams mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
Jim| Youre messing with me.
Michael| About what?
Jim| You did not have sex with Pams mom.
Michael| Oh, big time.
Jim| What kind of car does she drive?
Michael| She drives a green camry.
Jim| 
Michael| And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Jim| Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
Michael|  What?
Jim| Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
Michael| Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
Jim| Oh my God. 
Toby|  Hey, Jim.
Jim| Not now, Toby, my God!
Toby| Oh, Jesus! 
Michael| Get the hell out of here, idiot.
Toby| What did I do?  
Jim| Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again. 
Michael| I think youre underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
Jim| No, not more than anything. 
Michael| Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
Jim| Dont call her "the mom."
Michael| Shes right on my way home from work.
Jim| Then take a different way home, man! 
Michael| I di- alright, Ill take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
Jim| Okay, so were good.
Michael| Yeah.
Michael| Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
Erin| Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Michael| Sure. Thanks for asking.
Erin| Pam, were all set.  Yum.
Jim| Frank and beans!
Pam| Frank and beans!  So whatd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
Jim| You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Pam| Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we?
Jim| You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michaels slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. 
Pam| Come on, itll take two seconds.
Jim| No, it- 
Michael|  Oh, wow.
Pam| 
Michael| That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
Erin| Michael, youre all set at Botticellis. I changed the reservation to two people.
Michael| Erin, look. 
Erin| Fun!
Michael| Yeah.
Pam| Wow, Botticellis, that sounds like a special occasion. 
Michael| Yeah, no, its nobody.
Pam|  I dont know. I think Michael has a date. 
Michael|  Hmm... no.
Pam|  I think you have a date.
Michael| I dont.
Pam| Come on.
Jim| Uh, I think we should just drop it... cause obviously he doesnt want to talk about it.
Michael|  I dont deserve this, guys.
Jim| Yes, you do.
Michael| No, I dont.
Jim| Just take the parrot.
Michael| 
Jim| Okay, back to the old grind.
Michael| I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Pam| Oh, thats too bad.
Jim| Dont-
Michael| Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. 
Jim| Sounds complicated.
Michael| It is.
Pam| Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Michael| You want me to be happy?
Pam| Of course.
Michael| Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
Pam| Oh.
Michael| More than a friend, a co-worker.
Pam| Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who? 
Michael| Its okay.
Pam| No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
Michael| That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
Pam| 
Dwight|  You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Michael| Okay.
Dwight| Theres an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... 
Michael|  Feels good.
Dwight| Theres a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... 
Michael| Im sleeping with Pams mom. Sometimes, dinner.
Dwight| ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Pam|  How could you do this to me? Hes my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
Jim|  Who wants a hot chocolate?
Pam| Thank you.
Jim|  Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Pam| You need to be more upset about this. Shes your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
Jim| Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
Andy| Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
Jim|  
Andy|   How may I be of service to you?  
Jim|  I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwights birthday, what do you think?  
Andy|   This aurea is a joke. 
Jim|  Really?
Andy|  What are you thinking?
Jim|  I was gonna go with this one.
Andy|   Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.  
Dwight|  The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
Andy|  I know, right?  
Dwight|  What were you talking about in there?  
Andy|  Trust me it would only make you mad.  
Michael|   Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
Andy|  Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?  
Michael|  That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and Im not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other peoples needs ahead of our own.  
Pam|  Haha!  Ha ha ha.  
Jim|  And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  
Michael|  Who wants to help the world one step at a time?   Alright, good.  
Dwight|  Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
Michael|  Alright, thats... 
Meredith|  Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
Michael|  Alright... 
Pam|  I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  
Michael|  Okay, Im out of here,  see you later guys... 
Various|  Get out and stay out, bye... 
Michael|  Ok, oh no heres an idea... conservation... 
Pam|  I love it, conservation.  Lets start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.     No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  
Michael|  Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?  
Angela|  I have some ideas about conservation... 
Jim|  Yes!  Angela!  Please... 
Michael|   Can you hold down the fort?    Hey boo!
Angela|  Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally... 
Michael|   Whats it... why are you crying?  
Jim|  Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder... 
Kevin|  Shhhh... 
Angela|  Well, for our profit... 
Kevin|   Shhh... 
Michael|   No, no, no, Ill talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, Ill let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.  
Kevin|  Whos pickle?  
Michael|   Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.  
Angela|  Im sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Jim|  Yes.
Oscar|  Hold on, hold on, whats going on?  
Jim|  Nothing... nothing at all... its all good!
Pam|  Im not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
Michael|  For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?  
Pam|  Dont call my mother your lover.
Kevin|  Yes!  Thats what Im talking about.
Andy|  That is not okay dude.
Michael|  Alright, in my defense... 
Phyllis|  Disgusting... 
Creed|  Shes messed up man... 
Pam|  Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
Oscar|  You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Michael|  Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly Im outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  Im caring, Im generous, Im sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.  
Phyllis|  Good luck Michael, I hope you find what youre looking for.
Oscar|  Maybe youre right, who are we to... 
Pam|  Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
Dwight|  I dont think theres a whole lot of sleeping going on.  
Michael|  Lets get back to the matter at hand.  
Pam|  Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybodys mom... 
Michael|  No, no, no... no, no... 
Ryan|  Whoa, thats my mother youre talking about... 
Michael|  I dont like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
Pam|  Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
Michael|  Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
Pam|  You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Michael|  I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am... 
Pam|  Me too... 
Pam|  Hey. 
Oscar|  Hey.
Angela|   Pam, hows your day going?  
Oscar|  Pam, just for the record, I think youre overreacting a little bit, your moms old enough to make her own decisions.  
Pam|  Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?  
Oscar|  My mothers in a wheelchair.
Pam|  Well, he could still... Im sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.  
Kelly|   Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?  
Ryan|  Ahh, I dont think so, no... 
Kelly|  Well, I think Id look really hot in one.  Whered you get your fedora?  
Ryan|  Id rather not say.
Kelly|  I think Im gonna get the same fedora as you.  
Erin|   Hi Dwight!
Dwight|   Shh!
Ryan|   ...it should go with the persona you already have.  
Kelly|  Well, I think I have that persona.
Dwight|  Where did you get that mallard?  
Kelly|  What the hell is a mallard?
Dwight|  That!  
Kelly|  Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.  
Dwight|  Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, Im taking that back.
Kelly|  If you take it back, Ill scream.
Dwight|   Ill give you five bucks for it.
Ryan|  Twenty.
Dwight|  Ten.
Ryan|  Deal. 
Kelly|   Youre so cool.
Ryan|  This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.  
Michael|   Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
Toby|  Yeah, sure, whats up?
Michael|  Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, Im sorry.  
Toby|  Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
Michael|  Can I sit down for a second?
Toby|  Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.  
Michael|  This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
Toby|  Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.  
Michael|  She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
Toby|  Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.  
Michael|  Really?  Would you do that?  
Toby|  Yeah... thats why they pay me the big bucks.  
Michael|   Youre a good, good guy.
Toby|  Im good... 
Toby|  You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, wed become friends.  
Toby|   Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
Pam|  Sure, whats up?  
Toby|  Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything thats happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.  
Pam|   Whats the matter, you cant fight your own battles?  
Michael|  No... thats... 
Toby|  Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know... 
Pam|   Oh, would that make you feel better?  
Michael|  I dont... um... I cant hear your conversation.  
Pam|  You can tell Michael that Im not leaving.
Toby|    Buddy, I think that... 
Michael|  Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... youre a jackass.    Hey, hey, you know what?  Youre just as stubborn as your mother, when you dont wanna do something you just dont do it.  
Stanley|  Heh, heh, heh.  
Pam|  Michael, youre just her rebound!
Michael|  You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.  
Pam|   What!  You knew?  
Jim|  Barely, I... I dont have all the facts.  Frank and Bean... 
Michael|  Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how were gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
Pam|  Mmmmm, yes!
Michael|  Well, that is not gonna happen!
Pam|  Then whyd you even offer!?
Michael|  Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
Pam|  Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
Michael|  You know what?  Im gonna start dating her even harder.
Pam|  Whats that supposed to mean?  
Michael|  You know what it means.  
Jim|   Hey... 
Pam|  Shut it!
Jim|  Yep... 
Michael|  I dont need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pams mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, whats her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.  
Jim|   Dwight, you brought the mallard back.  
Dwight|  Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even... 
Jim|   Hi buddy.  
Dwight|   Im sorry. 
Jim|  A wooden duck?
Dwight|  Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.  
Jim|  Okay, just to be clear, youre terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... 
Dwight|  Oh, Im equipped... I can...
Jim|  Silence.  
Dwight|  Dont tell Michael... 
Jim|  I wont.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Dwight|  Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  
Michael|   Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.  
Erin|  Night Michael.
Michael|  Night Erin.
Jim|   Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.  
Pam|    Awww, he did that for me?  
Jim|  Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.  
Pam|  Mmmm.
Jim|   Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?  
Pam|  Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.  
Jim|  Well, we went on a Segway tour and were awesome at it and Frank and Beans!  
Pam|  Maybe Im overreacting.
Jim|  Yeah... maybe.
Pam|  But I dont think I am.  
Jim|  Youre not, nope.  Nope.  
Kevin|   Oh... whered you get that hat?  
Ryan|  Id rather not say.
Dwight|   "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..."  Ive got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  Im not insane.  "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."
