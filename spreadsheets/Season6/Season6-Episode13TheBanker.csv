Michael| Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... Im... pretty nervous about it. And... Im... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
Eric| Hi -
Computron|  Hello, Eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything.
Eric| Hello.
Michael|  I see youve met Computron, our virtual helper. Im Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
Computron| Yes.
Michael| What is the worlds largest ocean?
Computron| Calculating. Calculating. Pacific!
Michael| Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
Andy| Great news, Michael. Were now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
Michael| That is fantastic. Its good, but its not good enough. Keep working. And heres Pam. Shes our international sales consultant.
Pam| Hello.
Computron| The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972.
Pam| Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
Pam| It might seem crazy, but since theres no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflins highest ranking employee. So, thats where we are.
Michael| Hello, Stanley.
Fake Stanley| Hi.
Pam| For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
Eric| Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason Im here.
Michael| Ok. Well, I thought Id show you around a little bit - 
Eric| Right.
Michael| - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Coopers Seafood. You like lobster? Youve had lobster before, right?
Eric| Yeah.
Michael| They make the best Maine lobster in the world. Youll love it.
Computron| Mul Yam in Tel Aviv is better.
Michael| No, Computron, actually I think Coopers is the best. Youre gonna love it.
Computron| Are you calling me wrong?
Michael|  Oh, my God.
Eric| Its called due diligence. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. Im a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
Michael| Alright. Excuse me.  If you will -
Ryan| Michael, do you think I could get a space heater - 
Michael| - follow me this way. Ill introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. 
Dwight| Oh, we will. Have a seat. 
Michael| I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Tobys favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
Eric| So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.
Dwight| He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Toby| What are, are you doing at my desk?
Dwight| Ignore him. Hes the local lunatic.
Toby| Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
Dwight| Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the companys top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one Im currently wearing is that of gracious host.  Welcome. 
Toby| Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Eric| Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
Toby| What do you mean?
Eric| Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.
Toby| Um... nothing comes to mind. 
Eric| So, the staff? 
Toby| Mm-hmm.
Eric| Are people generally happy?
Toby|  Happys a funny word.
Eric| In what way?
Toby| You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy.  Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
Eric| So... generally?
Toby|  Yes.
Eric| Generally.
Toby| Generally happy. 
Eric|  Generally happy.
Eric| What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that? 
Toby| Oh, I dont know.
Eric| You, you dont know.
Toby| I dont know.
Eric| Youre the head of Human Resources.
Toby| I dont know. No.
Eric| Ok. 
Toby| I dont know how Im going to get through this. I dont want to lie and I DONT want to tell the truth.
Michael| Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin? Whatcha guys talkin about?
Toby| Well, Erics just going over some stuff.
Michael| Stuff. I love stuff.
Toby| Its, uh, its HR stuff.
Michael| HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
Eric| Its uh, its a company evaluation form.
Michael| Ah.
Eric| Talkin bout, uh - 
Michael| Talkin bout, uh, what?
Eric| Waste is next.
Michael| Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
Eric| No, waste of time and resources.
Michael| Oh, time and resources.
Toby| Look, you know, in any company  theres going to be certain degrees - 
Michael| No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. 
Eric| Is anyone near retirement age? 
Eric|  Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think Im gonna be here for awhile.
Michael| This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that?
Toby| Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
Michael| Thats, that is true. 
Dwight|  Thank you, so much.
Kevin| Thank you.
Angela| Thank you.
Eric| Thank you. Its nice to meet you all.
Pam| Good to meet you.
Angela| Have a great day.
Dwight| Hope to see you soon.
Kevin| Yeah.
Michael| I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? 
Michael| I dont care if he goes and files a report and says that were nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Computron| Computron experiencing emotion.
Michael| Computron, Im gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
Computron| Ok.
Michael| Just - sh -
Computron|  Please dont. Computron -
Michael| Shut - 
Computron| wants to live.
Michael| Shut up. Shut up.
