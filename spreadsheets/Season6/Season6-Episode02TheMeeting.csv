Michael|    Yeah?
Oscar|   You wanted to see me?
Michael|   Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
Oscar|   Yeah sure.
Michael|   Im going in for a procedure today.
Oscar|   Is everything okay?
Michael|   Yeah, its routine.  Im just a little bit scared.
Oscar|   Im sure everything will be fine.    What do you? Whats the procedure, if you dont mind my asking?
Michael|   It is a colonoscopy.
Oscar|   Okay.
Michael|   In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
Oscar|    Oh my God.
Michael|   My main concern, should I have a safe word?
Oscar|   Yeah.
David Wallace|   So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
Michael|   Abso... you know what? Ill do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
David|   Okay, I will look at it Monday.
Michael|   Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, Im gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and youll get it Weds.
David|   Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
Jim|   Sure.
Pam|   Hey, Good luck.
Michael|   Oh right, this thing. I remember now.    Whats this about?
Jim|   Ah, this is just me and David, if thats okay.
Michael|   Its okay with me but hes gonna want me in there.
David|   No, ah its okay Michael.  We got it.
Michael|   Really?
David|   Yeah.
Michael|   Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like Im gonna blow my brains out.
David|    Okay.
Michael|   Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
Michael|   Hey let me escort you to your desk.
Pam|   Okay, its just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Michael|   You and Jim are close, huh?
Pam|   Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Michael|   Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
Pam|    Ummm, I dont know.
Michael|   Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
Pam|   Did I?  Doesnt sound like me, not very superstitious.
Michael|   If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  Thats how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
Pam|   Please dont talk about my breast milk.
Michael|   I just dont want you to lie to me.  I dont want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
Pam|   Yeah.
Michael|   I just dont want you to.
Darryl|   I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, Im on the ground and the ladders on top of me.
Toby|   And thats how you broke your ankle?
Darryl|   Yes.
Dwight|   Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
Darryl|   This doesnt concern you man, you need to walk away.
Dwight|   Oh really, Im sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didnt know we were in communist Sweden.
Darryl|   If we were living in Sweden, I wouldnt have to worry about this cause wed have universal healthcare.
Dwight|   Nnnnn, thats not... okay.
Darryl|   Be quiet.
Dwight|   Im talking about... hmmm.
Toby|     I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
Darryl|   Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
Dwight|   So long Darryl, feel better...  Hes lying.
Toby|   He has a doctors note.
Dwight|   Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People dont just fall off of ladders.
Toby|   A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
Dwight|   Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?    Yall having birthday cake?
Toby|   Thats not a very good Darryl.
Dwight|   Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Toby|   Hmmm.
Dwight|   It just doesnt add up.
Toby|   Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didnt reach the top shelf.  I dont know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.   Ill punch you in da mush, see.
Michael|    Uh huh, well if he doesnt like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, Im going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
Jim|   Who was that?
Michael|   Sorry about that.  Whatd I miss?
David|   Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you dont mind.
Michael|    Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I dont.  Yes, I do!  No, I dont mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.   Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
Creed|    Theyve been in there a while.
Michael|   Yeah.
Creed|   Cant be good.
Michael|   Nope.
Creed|   Think theyre talking about me?
Michael|   No, I think theyre talking about me.
Creed|   Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
Michael|   What is Jim telling him?  That I cant handle this job?  That s bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
Pam|   Hey Kelly.
Kelly|   Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
Pam|   Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
Kelly|   Is Ryan going?
Pam|   I dont know, he hasnt RSVPd yet.
Pam|   We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.   Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls.   Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
Kelly|   Heres the deal.  I really want to go but Im not gonna go if Ryan doesnt go, because its kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because Id really like to be there to support Jim.
Andy|   What can I do for ya Hoss?
Michael|    How are your sales doin?
Andy|   How are my sales doin?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy.  Youre not buying it, youre good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  Im in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer.
Phyllis|   Again with the cousin.
Andy|   Oh, Im sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   "Hey Andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha."
Michael|   Shhh, Im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room, okay?
Michael|   Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that Im completely overwhelmed.
Michael|   You know when they say its so crazy it just might work?  Well, I dont believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
Michael|   Be my eyes.
Andy|   You got it.
Stanley|   What have we here?
Andy|   Oh, just backing up and turning around.
Kevin|    Hey, were gonna do this...
Andy|   Dit, dit, dit, dit, its not for you.   Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
David|   Cheese platter?
Andy|   Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think youll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.
David|   Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  Youve given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you wont do anything until we speak.
Jim|   No, I wont.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
David|   Thank you Jim.
David|   Erin, is Michael around?
Erin|   I think hes around here...
Michael|    Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin?
David|   Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Michael|   Yes, definitely.
Toby|    Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Dwight|   Nah, thats a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
Toby|   Youre into trains?
Dwight|   I have been my whole life.
Toby|   Wow.
Dwight|   Im rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Toby|   Thats so cool.
Dwight|   Yeah.
Toby|   Wow, Id love to take a look at that.
Dwight|   Yeah, its just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Toby|   Well, you know, cause of  the trains.
Dwight|   Wa... wa... wait , someones coming.
Toby|   Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
Dwight|   Here, get down! Hes not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Toby|   Get over there!  Get over there!
Dwight|   Oh, workers comp, my ass!
Toby|   I cant believe this.  Hey you, ass****!
Dwight|   Toby...
Toby|   You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Dwight|   Ooohhh...   Oh man!  You okay?
Toby|   Just keep going.
Pam|   Hey Ryan.
Ryan|   Hey.
Pam|   So, I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding.
Ryan|   Yeah, I might stop by.
Pam|   It costs about $75 per person.
Ryan|   Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Pam|   Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not?
Ryan|   Yes, Im coming to your wedding.
Pam|   Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
Ryan|   Probably, yes.
Pam|   Kelly Kapoor, yes.
David|   Are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites?
Michael|   Look who youre talking to.
David|   Im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents.
Michael|   Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
David|   What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Michael|      Permission to speak on the record?
David|   Please do.
Michael|   Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I dont think so.  Because Big Bird doesnt make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
David|   I thought you liked Jim?
Michael|   Very much, Jim is my best friend. But its his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.  
David|   "Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is."
Michael|  Its not very well written, but you get the gist.
David|   Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
Michael|   I can just continue to run it myself.
David|   Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Michael|   This was Jims idea?
David|   Mmhmm.
Michael|   Wow.  Ummm, well Id have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
David|   Ummm... okay, heres the thing though.  The plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
Jim|   I didnt tell Michael because I thought hed try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
David|   Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
Jim|   Sure.
Michael|   I cant help but feel partially responsible.
Michael|    Little pick me up?   Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
Jim|   When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Michael|   Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
Jim|   Why dont we head in your office to talk?
Michael|   Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
Jim|   Michael, look Ill just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Michael|   Hmmm, thats weird, thats weird... its kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy.
Jim|   Michael, did you say anything?
Michael|   Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
Jim|   Really?
Michael|   Yes!
Jim|   You will?  Wanna do it right now?
Michael|   Yes.
Jim|   I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Dwight|   I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if theyre dilated.
Toby|   If they were dilated...
Darryl|   Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
Gwenneth|   Definitely.
Darryl|   You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Dwight|   We thought that she was you.
Darryl|   Why would you think a lady is me?
Dwight|   Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
Toby|   No, nah.  I dont see it.
Darryl|   Heres what Im gonna do, Im calling corporate and Im filing a complaint against both of you.
Dwight|   Aww, Darryl.
Darryl|   Cmon Gwenneth.
Gwenneth|   Sad.
David|    This is David.
Michael|   Hey David, this is Michael Scott.    Michael Scott here.
David|   Yep.
Michael|   Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
David|   So, what, youre changing your mind about Jim?
Michael |   Absolutely,  not.   Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
David|   Michael, it seems like youre cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
Michael|   Wha... heres the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
David|   Well, it doesnt change what you showed me in Jims file.
Michael|   Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
David|   Michael, I really dont know whats going on  down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
Toby|   Hey Darryl, look ahhh, were here to apologize ahh...
Darryl|   Cool.
Dwight|   Wait!  Theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Toby|   What?
Dwight|   He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
Darryl|   Stupidest thing Ive ever heard.
Dwight|   Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
Toby|   Well, I dont think theres any reason to check em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Darryl|   Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
Dwight|   Yes!
Toby|   You really did it...
Dwight|   Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
Darryl|   And Im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Dwight|   Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
Toby|   Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Toby|   So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Michael|   Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
Jim|   How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Michael|   I never recommended you because I didnt want to lose you and I didnt want to lose Pam,  and now I dont wanna lose the baby.
Jim|   So instead, you screwed me?
Michael|   Thats what she...
Jim|   No.
Erin|   David Wallace is calling.
Michael|   Kind of in the middle of something here.
Erin|   Should I tell him youll call him back?
Michael|   I, yeah... no, Ill tell him myself.  Lets both.
Michael|    Hello.
David|   Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
Michael|   No, its just us.
David|   Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Michael|   Oh, oh, well here he is right now.    Come in.
Jim|   Hi David.
David|   Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyones on board.
Michael|   Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
David|   We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
Jim|   Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
Michael|   I like that, so manager and co-manager.
David|   Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Michael|   Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
David|   Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.   Okay look, Im not going to force you into anything.  If youre willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and well find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
Dwight|   Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Michael|   Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
Dwight|   Im... I was making it.
Michael|   Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
Stanley|   Co-manager of what?
Michael|   Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
Phyllis|   Whats happening to you Michael?
Michael|   Whats happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
Jim|    Thank you.
Dwight|  AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Meredith|   Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
Pam|   Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Meredith|   Nah, Ill just tell you now, easier.
Pam|   Well, you have to choose a food option and theres information in there about directions and lodging...
Meredith|   Ill just have whatevers fanciest, unless theres ribs.  Ill just get the other information the day of, Ill text you.
Pam|   You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
Meredith|   Uh huh.
Pam|   To ask for directions..
Meredith|   Right...
Pam|    And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
Meredith|   Unless theres ribs.
Angela|   Rude.
Pam|   So rude, right?
Angela|   Mmm hmmm.
Pam|    Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  Its incredible.
Angela|   Pam, my bag was there...
