Michael| Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is?
Jim| No.
Michael| Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
Jim| Is he you?
Michael|  I am flattered. Thats Johnny Depp.
Jim| Where did you take that?
Michael| In my condo complex.
Jim| Oh my God, thats right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton. 
Michael| I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
Jim| Sure. That they should do one.
Michael|  Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl? 
Jim| Whos that?
Michael| Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. 
Jim| John Dillinger.
Michael| No. Im Captain Jack Sparrow.
Jim| Captain Crunch. 
Michael| Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, its not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought youd seen Roger Clemens?
Jim| At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Michael| Yeah. Well, it wasnt him.
Jim| I had a little better reason to believe that... Youre right. Youre right. Well, youre not right, because Johnny Depp...
Michael| I know, I know.
Jim| ...in your condo complex.
Michael| I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
Jim| M. Night Shulman?
Michael|  First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you dont have a pet, please dont feel like - 
Stanley| When are we getting to sales topics?
Dwight| Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Michael| Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meetings not over.
Phyllis| But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Michael| No sales topic per se.
Andy| Well then no Andy Bernard per se. 
Michael| Dwight?
Dwight| Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Michael| I would like your undivided attention, please.
Dwight|  You couldnt handle my undivided attention.
Michael| Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think its kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
Dwight| Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier. 
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| When I was asking about the leads.
Michael| M-hmm.
Dwight| ... is there any news on the leads?
Michael| Is that all you have to say to me?
Dwight| Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, Ill tell you what. Im going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out!
Dwight| Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Angela| Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because Ive e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Phyllis| Honey, if I dont have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely dont have time to walk over to your desk. 
Michael| Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. Its a big cheque. 
Jim| Oh, sorry, wait one second.
Michael| Stop sexting Pam. Im trying to congratulate you.
Jim| This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Michael| You writing your memoirs over there?
Jim| You writing your name over there?
Michael| Well, its a pretty big check.
Jim| Thats good. You know, with the kid.
Michael| Okay. Dont gloat. Heres the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. 
Jim| Alright, here we go.  Michael...
Michael| Im just saying, that - 
Jim| Michael -  Great.
Andy|  Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy...  Im making a sale. Sales.
Darryl| Theres other pencils in this office.
Andy| Give me that 
Michael| Honey and jelly sandwich time. 
Darryl| Michael.
Michael| Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. Thats - 
Darryl| I know who did that.
Michael| You saw who did this and you didnt stop them?
Darryl| Didnt have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control. 
Michael| The sales department smashed my sandwich. 
Darryl| Yes. All of em. Together. Its a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them. 
Michael| You dont get it.
Darryl| You need to get back on top. 
Michael| Thats what she said.
Darryl| Yeah.
Michael| Yeah.
Erin| Something came for you, Michael. 
Michael| Thank you very much.
Jim| Whatd you get?
Michael| Ah, just the stupid leads.
Jim| Alright!
Stanley| About time. 
Andy| Me likey!
Phyllis| Finally, Michael. Hand em over, numbnuts.  But seriously. Its your job to give us those leads. 
Michael| Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what Im thinking? Im thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you dont. Not even Sabre owns this place. Its a rental. Im kind of sick of the attitude around here. Im sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. 
Stanley| We need those leads, Michael. Its our job Michael. Michael!
Gabe|  Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Michael| Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
Gabe| Michael, I dont want to incentivise murder. But - weve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff - 
Michael| They act like I have no power.
Gabe| But you do. You are in charge - 
Miichael| Thank you.
Gabe|  - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael. 
Michael| Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. 
Gabe| Okay, good.
Michael| Exactly that. 
Gabe| Good.
Michael| Exactly that. 
Gabe| Why do you keep repeating - 
Michael| Hello. May I have everyones attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so Im going to give the leads to... King Creed! 
Phyllis| What are you - 
Michael| - and to King Meredith! 
Stanley| They arent salespeople!
Michael| And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens . 
Phyllis| What the hell do you think youre doing?
Michael| Im giving them the leads, Phyllis. 
Jim| Hey.
Michael| Hey.
Jim| So Im going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-ones going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Michael| Mm-hmm.
Jim| Alright. So why dont you just give me my share of the leads, and Ill start making some calls?
Michael| Okay. 
Jim| Hey, alright.
Michael| Alright.
Jim| Ahh, these arent leads. What are they? 
Michael| Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids dont respect the father who doesnt respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
Jim| I dont think you understand - 
Michael| I do understand it. 
Jim|  This ones a map.
Michael| Or is it?
Angela| Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Phyllis| Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Angela| Ill give you the leads. But you know what? Its going to cost you some clerical work  
Phyllis| What are these for?
Angela| It doesnt matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when youre done, you can watch me shred them. 
Kelly| I want to watch the Kardashians! I dont want to watch boring - 
Ryan| Its my -
Stanley| The Kardashians is a good show.
Ryan| No its - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Kelly|  Its about a family. A real-life family.
Ryan| No, Stanley, do you - 
Pam|  Hey baby, whats up?
Jim| I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Pam| Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
Jim| Oh my god, I couldnt envy you more. 
Jim| Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - thats just unfair.
Jim| How about this one - When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.
Pam| He means his mopey place, its under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca. 
Jim| I love you.
Michael| Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldnt be in this business.
Andy| Hey. I guess you probably wont give me your leads since Im a jerk salesman. 
Erin| Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads.
Andy| Where? 
Erin|  Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot.  Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower. 
Andy| Are you...
Erin| Lower.
Andy| Are you sure?
Erin| Lower 
Dwight| What are you doing, idiot? 
Jim| Michaels stupid scavenger hunt.
Dwight| Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it.  The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.
Jim|  Lincoln.
Dwight| The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
Jim|  It involves you too. 
Dwight| The leads are in? 
Dwight| Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in. 
Michael| Well, bigshot, If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes. 
Dwight| Kevin! Damnit  Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? Cmon - 
Kevin| You are never going to find them.
Dwight| Really.
Kevin| Im going to enjoy this. 
Dwight|  Gimme the leads. Where are my leads? 
Kevin|  Im still enjoying  it. 
Dwight| Where are they?
Kevin| Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
Dwight| Turn the trash  Its code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress. 
Meredith|  Okey-dokey.
Kevin| No, dear god, no, its in the trash can. In the kitchen. 
Meredith| Its coming off anyway.
Dwight|  Clean sack.
Kevin| What -  
Erin| I emptied it in the dumpster. With Tobys baba ganoush.
Toby| If we dont patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, therell be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Dwight|  Its empty!
Michael| Wait. What day is today?
Kevin| Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday. 
Michael| Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
Michael| Okay. You know what, lets just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, cmon, shotgun in my car - 
Phyllis| Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Michael| Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, theyre now in the city dump."
Stanley| Not your staff, Michael. You.
Michael| Well, thats not the way its going t sound. Heres what were going to do. Well go to the dump, well look around, then well all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - 
Toby| Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
Michael| Really?
Angela| Im not going. You did this, not us.
Michael| Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!
Darryl| That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Michael| You can.
Darryl| I cant. You know that. 
Michael| Okay fine, I get it. Ill just go by myself.
Dwight| Ill go, Michael. Youll just screw it up.
Dwight|  This place has gone to hell. 
Michael| You know, Dwight, there was a time when youd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
Dwight|  Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
Michael| Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you dont believe me, look in my gutters. 
Kelly|  Youre adorable. You need to go for it.  Im going to be, like, mad at you if you dont - 
Jim| Phew! Cant wait for this day to be over.
Kelly| Why?
Jim| Just all the - drama.
Kelly| What drama? 
Jim| Between the - us and you guys. Its unnecessary, right?
Kelly| So unnecessary.
Jim| Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Kelly| I mean, if the salesmen werent acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldnt be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Jim| I have new baby pictures.
Kelly| Dont use your cute baby to make us like you.
Jim| Shes wearing a onesie 
Stanley| If we act nice now, then were rewarding them for treating us poorly.
Jim| Didnt we kind of start it?
Phyllis| I think youre remembering that wrong?
Andy| Yeah. 
Phyllis| I dont know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The companys changed, and if they dont like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. 
Jim| Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Andy| All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed - 
Jim|  I dont think we need opposed.
Michael|  Youve changed, man.
Dwight| Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission? 
Michael| Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
Dwight| Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
Michael| No, Im talking about your personality, Dwight.
Dwight| When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if Id assistant managed him - 
Michael| Assistant to the managed him - 
Dwight| Oh, thats low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Michael| Yeah.
Dwight| Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Michael| You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Dwight| I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs. 
Michael| Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldnt have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - 
Dwight| Kung-fu movies!
Michael| You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - 
Dwight| Nice babies youre making with the floozies at the bars.
Michael|  Thats my wife youre talking about, man.
Dwight| Your made-up wife? Who doesnt exist?  You watch it!
Michael| If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. 
Dwight| Dont do it 
Michael| No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!
Dwight| No! 
Michael| Dont even think about that 
Dwight|  Stop it, get out! Thats my spool. 
Phyllis| Whats the least we can do to make this okay?
Jim| Ill text Pam. Shes really good at this stuff.
Andy| And Ill text Erin. Shes really good at this stuff too.
Phyllis| I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Stanley| That is a dangerous precedent.
Jim| Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Phyllis| Oh, if they dont have an iPod by now they really dont want one.
Jim| Alright. Then were back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, Im for it.
Phyllis| Okay, fine. Cash it is.
Andy| Erin just texted me back. People love shells from far-away beaches". 
Michael| Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god.
Dwight| Oh 
Michael| Were never going to find those leads, are we? 
Dwight|  Wow. Amazing, isnt it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Phyllis| So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you - 
Jim| No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody!
Meredith|  Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Jim| No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is really sorry.
Andy| Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Phyllis| Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  
Oscar| Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Kevin| Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. 
Angela| Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Jim| Yes! We do.  Eclairs.
Stanley|  Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our - 
Jim| - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee. 
Phyllis| Our treats, Stanley, theyve accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more. 
Stanley|  This is - nice!  All of us back together.
Michael| This  Why would somebody throw that out?  
Dwight| Hey  You know whod like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Michael| Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?
Dwight| Yeah 
Michael| Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. Thats it. And the caption would read 
Dwight| Hope - grows.
Michael| In the dump.
Dwight|  Woo hoo!
Stanley| Good news that you found our leads?
Michael| No! Better!
Dwight| We have an awesome bean bag chair thats perfect for the break room. 
Phyllis| Yuck. Im not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Dwight| Yeah, damn right youre not. Cause its for me and Michael only 
Andy|  Its freezing out here.
Erin|  Go on. I have warm blood. 
Andy| Oh wow, thank you. Youre the nicest person Ive ever met.
