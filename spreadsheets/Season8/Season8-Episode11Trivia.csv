|Kevin
 Oh yeah!|All
 Aw!|Dwight
 Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.|Oscar
 You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar?|Kevin
 I cant help it, Oscar. Its just really good.  Oh yeah!|Jim
 All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so lets try again. Get it all out now if you have to.|Andy
 It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!|Dwight
 You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or its going to drive me insane.|Jim
 Okay, done.|Erin
  Does anyone have a first aid kit?|Darryl
 Check out this song I wrote Ima love you downstairs tonight... |Jim
 All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-|Andy
  Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?|Jim
 You can write a book about chairs.|Andy
 Books! Excellent, Jim.|Oscar
 Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-|Andy
  Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? |Jim
 Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that dont know what paper is.|Andy
 Im talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Lets get high on our own supply!|Angela
 Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?|Andy
 Yes!|Andy
 Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. Thats today. And were eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I cant afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper thats in my garage.|Dwight
 Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I havent managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.|Dwight
 Dwight Schrute for Robert California!|Receptionist
 Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. Ill tell him youre here. Can I get you anything at all?|Dwight
 Im not here to be given anything. Im here to take what is mine.|Receptionist
 Ooh. Im glad youre on our team. Here, please have a seat.|Gabe
 Dwight? What are you doing here?|Dwight
 Gabe? You dont know?|Gabe
 Course I know.|Dwight
 Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrels office.|Gabe
 Corporate says to me, â€œGabe, we need you in Scranton.â€ Scranton says, â€œGabe, go back down to Florida. Youre needed there.â€ So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, Im up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Im down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.|Robert
 Dwight.|Dwight
 Robert.|Robert
 You made it.|Dwight
 Yes.|Robert
 Impressive initiative. I dont know whats worse, the trip or the destination.  Well, uh, let me settle in and Ill be with you shortly.|Dwight
 Very good.|Andy
 Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if theyre willing to "play ball." Those were his words.|Oscar
 Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!|Andy
 So make that error!|Oscar
 Andy, no-|Kevin
 Hey! I can make that error.|Oscar
  Aw...|Andy
 Well, its just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but its a little more complicated than that.|Kevin
 No, I-|Andy
 Its just, I really need a real accountant on this.  What do you say?|Oscar
 Im leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.|Andy
 Oh.|Oscar
 Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!|Andy
 What?|Oscar
 Its only the biggest night of trivia of the year. Theres a thousand dollar prize. Im committed to my friends, theyre committed to me.|Andy
 You know what? Go. Have fun.|Andy
 Theres a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.|Jim
 Stop right there. I love it.|Darryl
 Im in.|Andy
 I didnt even say what it is.|Darryl
 Its trivia.|Jim
 In Philadelphia.|Andy
 But heres the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...|Jim
 Thats a great idea.|Darryl
 Thats a great plan.|Andy
 Yeah? You like it?|Jim
 Yeah.|Andy
 All right.|Jim
 All right, good stuff.|Andy
 Im so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid."|Darryl
 You just made a good idea, a great idea.|Andy
 There is one problem with this plan.|Darryl
 What?|Andy
 Wed have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.|Gabe
  You can reduce your prices by ten percent or were going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. |Dwight
 Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. Youre the bagel guy.|Gabe
 Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question Whats the most important appliance in your house?|Dwight
 Meat grinder.|Gabe
  Too slow. Its the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.|Dwight
 You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. Youre an American classic.|Robert
 Dwight. Today is not my day at all, Im afraid. Im not going to be able to meet with you, but Im leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.|Dwight
 But I can give you this pitch in one minute-|Robert
 No, hes going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I dont want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. Hes a great person to know. Ill dialogue with him tonight. |Gabe
 CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.|Dwight
 Still an important position. Still a chief.|Gabe
 Youre really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him.  Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.|Robert
 Gabe, listen to me. Dont bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwights pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.|Gabe
 Your wish is my command.|Robert
 Its a command.|Oscar
 I dont believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?|Andy
 You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.|Oscar
 What? No!|Andy
 Ive got a quota to hit. I dont care how I hit it.|Oscar
 And you guys thought this was a good idea?|Jim
 I thought it was a fun idea.|Darryl
 There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. Thats the thing about long drives, you know, youre always going to- this is a gay bar.|Andy
 Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?|Oscar
 Yes! Its a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?|All
 No. Nah.|Oscar
 What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think youre going to win your sales quota? At a gay bars trivia night? |Andy
 It says that I believe that my staffs intelligence and that Im willing to try anything.  Not anything.|Oscar
 Good luck.|Andy
 Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but its winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.|Meredith
 Good-timers follow me.|Phyllis
 Backups. |Stanley
 Go on, kid. You know you dont belong here.|Andy
 A-team.|Jim
 Okay.|Andy
 All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... |Kevin
 Okay. |Jim
 Theres a table over here.|Host
 All right, first question everyone Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?|Andy
 Oh, we got this!|Creed
 Lets reverse engineer this. Youre a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where youre a novelty. Alaska?|Stanley
 Atlanta.|Phyllis
 Oh I know you think that, because thats where the Olympics were held.|Cathy
 My cousins were actually at those Olympics.|Stanley
 Keep talking all you want.|Kevin
 How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?|Erin
 Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.|Host
 Okay, times up. Lets get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer. |Gabe
 Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-|Dwight
  Theres no fires within eight miles of here.|Gabe
 Well, its nine miles away. Im going to be meeting with you on his behalf.|Dwight
 What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COOs office on the phone this instant!|Receptionist
 This must be very frustrating.|Gabe
 I can see you in the jungle now.|Host
 Okay, now, youre not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?|Andy
 Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.|Jim
 Shawn Marion.|Darryl
 Yes, Shawn Marion.|Ryan
 That doesnt sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.|Jim
 Wrong, for so many reasons.|Phyllis
 Well, I know Elizabeth Taylors sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?|Stanley
 Thats it. Im going to go watch the boats on the river.|Kevin
 Ron Artest, Kelly.|Kelly
 No, its Lamar Odom. If itd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when hes at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.|Host
 All right, boards up. Lets see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you. |Jim
 Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.|Kevin
 Nicely done!|Andy
 Youre my sports guys! Youre ESPN, youre ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. Im E!, TLC and Oxygen.|Darryl
 Chill, man. This plan is airtight.|Dwight
 So its a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!|Receptionist
 Well, you got my vote.|Dwight
 Oh my God.|Gabe
 I know.|Dwight
 Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?|Gabe
 What?|Dwight
 Whats with the smile?|Gabe
 Youre doing great. You know, so good.|Dwight
 And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.|Gabe
 Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush!  Ow!|Dwight
 Take me to Robert.|Gabe
 Ow! He went home.|Dwight
 Take me to his house.|Gabe
 Uh, its a condo and its long-term business housing.|Dwight
 You know where it is. Lead me there.|Gabe
 Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!|Dwight
 Listen, youre a perfectly fine toilet. Im just an extraordinary piece of crap. Lets go.|Host
 Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?|Ryan
 Yeah?|Host
 Im sure youre just checking your Grindr account...  but you cant check smart phones during trivia, its against the rules.|Ryan
 Okay, Im turning it off.|Host
 Okay, youre not turning it off.|Ryan
 I wont look at it.|Host
 Sir?|Ryan
 I cant- I cant not touch it.|Host
 Okay, then were going to have to take it away.  Thank you.|Ryan
 Look, I cant, I cant not have my phone. Im sorry. I want to be with my phone. |Host
 All right, guys. After nine rounds, lets check the scores. In first place, with nine points, its Aesops Foibles.  The Queerenstein Bears have seven points.  Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points.|Jim
  All right.|Host
 D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points.  Ladies Gaga have five points. |Andy
 So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.|Dwight
 Which one is it?|Gabe
 I dont know. All I know is the building.|Dwight
 Robert! Robert California! Robert!|Robert
 Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.|Host
 All right guys, times up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. Thats all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So lets get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.|Kevin
 Oh yeah!|Kelly
 What! |Host
 In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears. |Queerenstein Bears
 Whoo! Lets go!|Host
 And, in first place, is Aesops Foibles.|Oscars friend
 Whoo!|Darryl
 Yeah, were going to get clobbered.|Host
 Ring it in when you know it. First question This man had a fatwa declared on him when-  Einsteins?|Meredith
 What?|Erin
 What is it?|Meredith
 What?|Erin
 I did my part, babe. Im just the bell girl. |Host
 Aesops?|Oscar
 Salman Rushdie.|Host
 Salman Rushdie is correct.  Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what? |Meredith
 Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-|Erin
 Flying jib.|Host
 Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. |Robert
 Shalom.  Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours.  I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.  |Stu
 Grab my knee!|Gabe
 Yay Robert!|Robert
 Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.|Host
 According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents.|Oscars friend
  Boom! ADHD!|Host
 No. |Meredith
 Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!|Host
 Thats correct for the Einsteins. |Andy
  Whoo! Yeah!|Host
 Sir-|Andy
 Go Einsteins!|Host
 Dial it back, this isnt Tail Feathers, okay? |Robert
 They havent really improved on the Oreo, have they?|Dwight
 No thank you.|Robert
 Sit down, Dwight.|Dwight
 Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible?|Robert
 You were dining alone? All those people are you?|Dwight
 Yes, exactly. Riddle number two Who is going-|Robert
 Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a managers job. And Florida, you dont want to live here. Even I dont want to live here. Thats why Im always at my place in Scranton. Florida is Americas basement Its wet, its filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?|Dwight
 N... its complicated.|Robert
  This medal was my grandfathers. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. Its a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? |Dwight
 Its a job interview, not a flea market.|Robert
 Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, Ill try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.|Dwight
 Yes.|Host
 Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope youre ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.|Andy
 Oh, come on!|Host
 The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? |Kevin
 Three hundred pounds!|Host
 Point for the Einsteins.  Heres your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.|Oscar
  Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.|Oscars friend
 Yes!|Host
 Im sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.|Kevin
  Les Jolies Choses.|Meredith
 Are you sure?|Kevin
 Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.|Host
 The Einsteins win it! |Oscar
 No! Come on!|Kevin
 Look, I know its easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but heres a piece of trivia a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.|Stonewall Host
 Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars!|Kevin
 Lets just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.|Stonewall Host
 Riboflavin.|Kevin
  Riboflavin?|Stonewall Host
 Michigan.  The President of the United States is "P.O.T.U.S."  John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath. |Kelly
 Cause its like, really...|Andy
 Einsteins! Great work.|Kevin
 Thank you.|Andy
 You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?|Oscar
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.|Kevin
 Andy, were fine. We dont wanna switch. Were already like, the perfect unit.|Andy
 Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.|Meredith
 Whoo! Brought some brain food.|Erin
 Yeah!|Kelly
 Having fun.|Meredith &amp; Kelly
 One, two, three...|Kevin
 When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well whos laughing now?|Announcer
 Say â€œShalomâ€ to your shrubs on this Jewish holiday that celebrates the new year for trees.|Kelly
 Tu Bishvat!|Announcer
 Thats correct.|Einsteins
 Whoo!|Announcer
 Point for the Einsteins.|Kelly
 Hey, is it true that youre not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?|Announcer
 Uh, I dont think so.|Kelly
 I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....|Oscar
 It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.|Andy
 Alright, if youre not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.|Jim
 Andy, its the last day of the quarter. Weve already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.|Andy
 Not helping, tuna.|Stanley
 Yeah, Im sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.|Andy
 We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Roberts face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.|Kevin
 Oh, will we get to see that look?|Andy
 No, thats why...thats why I said think of it.|Jim
 Andy, were gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.|Group
 Yeah.|Angela
 Yeah, it is, Andy.|Andy
