Dwight| Oh, ugh.  What is this, a meatball? Really? 
Jim| Its always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that shes out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, Ive found out what he likes. And its really weird.
Dwight| Jim, come on! Thats so juvenile! What the- 
Stanley| Youve been meatballed! 
Dwight| Ugh.
Stanley| Are you ready for some meatball?
Dwight| Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim.
Jim| I know.
Stanley| Look for your stapler!
Dwight|  Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Stanley|  Oh okay. Good night.  Whats the haul?
Dwight| Thirty-two meatballs.
Stanley| Good day.
Dwight| That idiots been feeding us for a week.
Stanley| Well never have to buy meatballs again.
Erin|  Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, thats so great to hear.
Erin| Im not going to be one of those exes who cant move on. They have their life and I have mine. Im taking an Italian class. So far Ive learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well its not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Erin| I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Andy| Jessica! I love you! Thats a message from my mom.
Andy| My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, Im just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I havent proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Jim|  Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Oscar| Oh, who needs a house that size?
Dwight| Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Robert| Im selling the house, actually.
Jim| You know, theres a glare from over here... oh wow, thats magnificent.
Robert| Its mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and Ive got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now shes left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? Theyre calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room.  Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
Jim| Im sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Robert| What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
Jim| I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Robert| Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.
Andy| Um, Im getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
Robert| A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think Im entitled to the occasional bad day.
Andy| Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Kevin| Dude, what if, since youre feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? 
Oscar| Kevin, no.
Robert| What, as some sort of last hoorah?
Kevin| Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Robert| You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Lets try this everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Lets just call it a get-together. And lets say no food.
Kevin| Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Oscar| That was you, Kevin.
Kevin| It was me.
Meredith| You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Erin| Oh, I dont know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldnt drive maybe ever.
Meredith| Its no problem. You live right near me.
Erin| How do you know where I live?
Meredith| Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Erin| Why?
Meredith| He wanted to make sure California didnt put it in you.
Erin| Oh. Come on.
Erin| Wow. Andys such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. 
Angela|  Oh, it is warm.
Cathy| Its almost too warm.
Gabe| Im feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
Ryan| Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
Gabe|  Well, well say its eight-two and itll be our secret.
Cathy|  Hey, late guy.
Jim| Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Andy| Oh.
Jim| DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Jim| Youre looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I dont mean to brag, but New Years Eve, I was home by nine.
Jim| Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
Robert| You should see the whole thing.
Jim| I bet I should.  Thats beautiful, Im going to email that to you.
Robert| Im just about to give the tour.
Jim| All right-
Robert| Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
Jim| I must...
Jessica|  Wow.
Andy|  Yeah, its pretty serious poolage.
Jessica|  What are you doing?
Andy| Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. 
Jessica| Gross. Im getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Andy| No, Im good.
Erin|  Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Andy| Hi.
Erin| How is everything? Hows your car?
Andy| Its great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
Erin| Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Andy| Well, I cant. Im going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
Erin| Oh, like a goodbye trip.
Andy| No. What?
Jessica| Hey.
Erin| Hi.
Erin| I guess Andy isnt totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldnt survive, and I believe him.
Darryl| Val. You made it.
Val| Yup, yup.
Darryl| Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Val| You know, you are just as dumb at night.
Darryl| Mmm. 
Andy| All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
Jessica| No, show me.
Andy| Okay.
Jessica| Dive in right here.
Andy| In a minute. In a minute.
Jessica| Okay. You dont know what youre doing.
Andy| A minute would be cool.
Erin| Hey, Dwight Snoot.
Dwight| What-
Erin| What you doing?
Dwight| Im relaxing. Scram. 
Erin| Ow.
Andy| Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
Stanley| I moved them. Pants only need a chair if theres a person in them.
Andy| Where... 
Erin| Come on, dont you want to play?
Dwight| Oh really?
Erin| Yeah.
Dwight| Yeah, you want to play you little hick? 
Kevin| Whoa.
Angela| Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
Robert| Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it youre simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.
Oscar|  Holy cow!
Robert| Wine collection.
Oscar| How many bottles? Three hundred?
Robert|  About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.
Oscar| Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Toby| Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
Ryan| Robert, you are too kind.
Robert| Oh.
Gabe| Too kind doesnt begin to cover it.
Ryan| With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Gabe| And Gabe-y makes three.
Jim| Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This nights been magical.
Robert| Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.
Jim| Really? Why?
Robert| I dont know. Maybe not. Just come.
Erin|  Oh!
Dwight|  You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Erin| Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
Dwight| Im not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because Im mighty? Because Im the manliest man in the office? Ill do it. 
Erin|  Oh Dwight!
Erin|  Stop.
Dwight| You stop.
Erin| No, you stop.
Dwight| No, you stop.
Erin|  Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop.
Dwight| Okay, you can stop.
Erin| No, no, no, hes not looking.
Dwight| No, you can stop.
Erin| You can actually stop.
Kelly| Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
Meredith| The main stones missing.
Kelly| I dont know. It looks pretty great to me.
Robert| I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
Jim| Good night.
Oscar|  To the kitchen!
All| To the kitchen!
Robert| To the kitchen. Onward!
Oscar| Toby, whats compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Toby| Note? Its a symphony.
Oscar| Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Toby| I would love that.
Toby| Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess Im through the gateway now, though, right?
Darryl|  You know, I dont think Ive ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Meredith| You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Val| You in?
Darryl| Yeah, sure, sure. Ill be right in.
Darryl| Ive been working out. But, the problem is, Ive been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasnt burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Dwight|  Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, thats so good. Ah...
Erin| Andys not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Dwight| Damn it.
Erin| What is the most romantic possible thing?
Dwight| We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Erin| Dwight, thats just- thats really perfect. Thank you.
Both| Yes! 
Angela| Youre in my way!
Erin| Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Dwight| Chicken fight!
Andy| No thanks.
Erin| Dang it! What the heck already?
Dwight| Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
Cathy| Okay, yeah. Whos going to be my partner? Wheres Jim?
Kevin| Im right here!  Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Dwight| Yeah- oh!
Erin|  Yes! Woo!
Dwight| Woohoo! Yes!
Erin| Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
Dwight| I know. I could just bang you right now.
Erin| Hes not looking.  Hey!
Robert| I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
Jim| To both these bears.
Ryan| To both these bears.
Toby| Bears.
Oscar| To both these bears.
Robert| When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden  Pond.
Ryan| I mean, its clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Gabe| Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Andy| Kelly, thats a crazy ring you found.
Kelly| Yeah, thanks. Im really glad I found it.
Andy| I cant believe youre wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
Kelly| Shh. Of course Im superstitious. What are you talking about?
Andy| The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
Phyllis| Oh, I dont think youre being silly.
Kelly| Oh God. 
Andy| You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
Phyllis|  Then another woman will get it. We cant allow that. We have to destroy it.
Jessica|  Come on. Lets chicken fight those two.
Val|  How was that?
Kevin| Okay. Watch my toes. 
Darryl| Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water youve been drinking.
Val| No, Im good. Thank you.
Darryl| Cool.
Val| Cool.  Does Darryl not swim?
Kevin| Thats racist! I dont know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Jessica|  Yes!
Andy| Yeah!
Dwight|  Maybe we should take a little break.
Erin| Dwight, weve got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Dwight| Okay.
Erin| One more?
Andy| Yeah!
Jessica| Yeah! Great! 
Erin| Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Dwight| Go!
Erin| Go! Okay. Yeah.
Jessica| Here we go!  Yes!
Andy| Yay!  Whoa!
Kevin| Wow!
Andy| I cannot believe youre still up!
Jessica| I cannot believe it either.
Erin| Ive got this!  Charge! Go! Go! 
Andy|  Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
Dwight|  Erin, did we win?
Erin| Sure. Sure we did.
Dwight| Youre lying. We didnt win.
Erin| Hey, hey, hey Dwight. Its okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Kelly| Youve broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. 
Angela| Were in the pool!
Meredith| Shut it, Angela.
Dwight| Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phylliss birthday.
Andy| Ooh, do not remind me of Phylliss birthday.
Dwight| I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isnt she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I dont want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Andy| Mmm.
Dwight| So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Andy| Last I checked, Im with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. Its monogamy for my hog n me.
Dwight| Not what I asked.
Andy| Were done. Erin and I are over.
Dwight| So then you wont mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Andy| Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Dwight|  Youre an idiot.
Kevin| Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! 
Erin| Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Kevin| No!
Val| Oh Ive got him!
Darryl| Cannonball!  Lets do this!
Andy|  Wow.
Erin| So I kind of stepped on this. I think its yours.
Andy| Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Erin| The Bernard family seal. Duh.
Andy| Duh.
Erin| Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Andy| Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, its not a special night.
Erin| Oh, you werent going to do that?
Andy| Honestly Erin, I dont know what Im doing. I... I just... I dont know. Thank you.
Erin| Andys confused. Thats not what I was hoping for, but its not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Robert| And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Jim| To madness.
Ryan| To madness.
Toby| To madness. 
Meredith| To madness.
Jim| Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Meredith| Oh, Im sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Jim| Are you serious?
Ryan| Robert, I want you to know, Im here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Gabe| And that goes double for me. Ill stay even later than youd like.
Oscar|  Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Toby| And I am Bacchuss friend!
Robert| Gentlemen, bear witness. While Ive been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. 
All| Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!
Jim| And theres my talking point.
Robert| Yes, thats it. Push yourselves, boys. Its not a party if you dont do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
Ryan| Hey, hes asleep. We can just leave.
Gabe| So leave.
Ryan| Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Kathy| Whats the water like?
Darryl| Nice.
Angela| Oh, it is warm.
Phyllis| Roberts house is, well....I dont mean to sound offensive, but its like where a basketball player would live.
Erin| Oh, Dwight.
Dwight| Uh huh.
Erin| That feels so good!
Dwight| Yeah....baby.
Erin|  Hey, Andy.
Andy| Hey.
Erin| Dwight gives the best back massages.
Andy| Yeah, it sounds like it.
Dwight| Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
Erin| I dont know, why dont you check me Dr. Shrute. 
Dwight| No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. Its like the devils cursive.
Erin| You mean more like dangerous curves...
Dwight| Youd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...
Erin| Ow!
Erin| You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. Its over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you dont kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Dwight|  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Jessica| You guys ready?
Andy| Bring it on guys.
Dwight| Yeah...
Andy| Lets go before I vomit. 
Dwight| Ready?
Erin| Im ready.
Jessica| Whoo!
Andy| Alright! Here we go.
Erin| Ok.
Dwight| RAHHH!!!!!!!
Jessica| Yeah, come on!
Dwight| Get her! Ruin her! 
Andy| Hey! High-five!
Jessica| Yeah!
Jessica| My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didnt grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
Robert| This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. 
Ryan| I get that.
Gabe| Beautiful sentiment.
Jim| To the shame room! 
Gabe|  I live in this room.
Oscar|  Oh, Mineral-ey.
Toby| Mineral-ey.
