Pam|  This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, well be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
Kevin| Nice.
Pam| Theres this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, its not -- it doesnt sound cool. You just have to see it.
Pam| Well, I guess it doesnt look that cool either. But, its been up there a long time, so its become a pretty big deal.
Jim| Wow. Its the end of an era.
Pam| Did a good job, Buddy. Now its time to come home.
Oscar| I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
Kevin| When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Ryan| How long do you think its been up there, Kevin?
Kevin| I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, â€œLook, a balloon.â€
Dwight| My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Meredith| My kid didnt have a face tattoo.
Darryl| I was still thinking of going back to school.
Jim| And I was still just a paper salesman.
Dwight| Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. 
All| Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon.  
Jim| Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Kevin| oooh
Darryl| Me.
Phyllis| Yeah.
Dwight| Right here.
Nellie| Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Jim| Nellie
Nellie| Mmm.  Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Jim| What brings you to town?
Nellie| Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Lets build a shrine. No, Ive come to work here.
Dwight| What?
Dwight| How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. Im in an identical situation.
Toby| Robert did say youd be joining us. Welcome. Im Tony.
Nellie| Mm.
Pam| What?
Toby| I- I said Im Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, Im Toby.
Pam| You messed up saying your name?
Toby| It happens, okay? Uh, so lets just find an empty desk for you, and uh, Im sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Nellie| That one looks empty.
Jim| No, thats Andys office.
Nellie| Oh, is it?
Nellie| I have one simple philosophy in business if the seat is open, the job is open. Its how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Erin| Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Alonzo| Good morning Erin. 
Erin| How are you? Hows your family doing?
Erin| Bye.
Erin| Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. Thats right. Im a maid for an old lady. Her grandsons staying with us too because he ran out of money.  Listen to me, bragging away.
Robert| Nellie.
Nellie| Robert.
Robert| How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
Nellie| So far, so good.
Robert| Good.
Nellie| Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Robert| Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isnt it?
Nellie| Mm-hm.
Robert| Now. Lets find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Nellie| Oh, Ive already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Robert| We have a manager.
Nellie| Do you really? Because it is 1000. Ive been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Robert| Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
Kevin| Huh. Yeah, thats weird. Hes usually here by now. Right guys?
Andy|  Hello.
Robert| Andy, its Robert. Why arent you at work?
Andy| Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but Im super sick.
Robert| I dont care, I dont care. Please come to work immediately.
Andy| Okay, Ill try to come in even though Im really sick with the... 
Andy|  ...Florida Flu.
Robert| He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Andy| Im in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasnt coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right?  Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Robert| Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Jim| Cant you do something about this?
Robert| Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
Jim| -Right.
Jim| What is going on? And wheres Andy? And what is going on?
Irene| Erin, you got a package.
Erin| Im in the bathroom.
Glenn| Wheres the postage? I mean, theres no shipping label.
Irene| Did you wash your hands?
Erin| Yes.
Erin and Irene| 
Andy|  Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; Im yours!
Erin| Andy, what are you doing here? Its great to see you.
Andy| Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Irene| Wheres the ring?
Andy| Hm?
Irene| Wheres the ring, Lancelot?
Erin| Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Erin| Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But Im not coming back with you.
Glenn|  Why wont she go with him?
Irene|  I dont know. Maybe its cause hes not that handsome.
Erin| Hey... dont listen.
Nellie| So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesnt it?  Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady?  I know. Its a lot. So, who knows whats going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Jim| I think its a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. Its not a name.
Nellie| So no one can tell me whats going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other.  But why, mlady?  Because I am your new manager.
Pam| Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
Robert|  This is an odd situation. But its very interesting how its playing out.
Robert| We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someones lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
Nellie| I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Kevin| Hot tub party?
Nellie| Performance reviews.
Pam| How can you give us performance reviews if you dont know us?
Nellie| On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Glenn| Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
Erin| Oh, thanks. Ive been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. Its only going to keep getting better.
Irene| So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
Andy| Well, were not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few Is, you know.
Erin| So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Irene| I think you should leave, young man.
Andy| All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didnt want to stop until I saw you.
Erin| You didnt even stop to pee? Gross.
Jim| Any luck?
Pam| No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Andy|  Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Erin| Oh, youre doing so good. Oh my God, youre superman over there. 
Irene| You should take it. Its probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
Andy| Nope. Its just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell Im getting stronger.
Irene| You really wouldnt feel those kinds of results after one session.
Andy| I dont know.  Just let it vibrate. Its fine.
Irene| You could put it on silent.
Andy| I dont think it does that.
Irene| Just go to preferences, then click â€“
Glenn|  Proctology.
Jim|  Andy?
Andy| Jim?
Jim| Andy, where are you?
Andy| I- Im home in bed. Ive been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Irene| Hes here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
Jim| What? Youre in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertrams trying to take your job.
Andy| What do you mean, take my job?
Jim| Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Andy| Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but Im not coming home without Erin. So Ill talk to you later.
Jim| Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, youre basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Angela| Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldnt have to work?
Pam| I like working here.
Jim| Dwight, should she be our manager?
Dwight| I wouldnt let her manage a celery farm.
Dwight| Those who cant farm, farm celery.
Jim| And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? 
Nellie| All right. Lets get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Phyllis| Nellie, Im sorry, but I dont feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I dont know.
Nellie| Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Dwight| I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Nellie| Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. Youre getting a raise.
Dwight| What?
Nellie| Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Dwight| Theres no limit to what I think I deserve.
Nellie| Then you accept it?
Dwight| Five percent. No less.
Nellie| Absolutely not. Seven percent.
Dwight| Six percent, I know my worth.
Jim| The raise isnt real.
Dwight| Money isnt real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Nellie| So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? Im fairly certain youre going to like it.
Pam| Phyllis.
Phyllis| Pam.
Nellie| So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Phyllis| Really?
Nellie| Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Jim| Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Robert| I am not. Huh.
Jim| Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Robert| Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
Jim| Land. World. Uh, its not that I dont want a-- well, yes, I guess Id take a raise. Thats not what Im saying. Thats not-- sorry.
Robert| Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
Jim| Yes.
Robert| Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
Jim| Oh, god, nature, please.
Robert| When two animals are having sex, one of them...
Jim| 
Robert|  is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isnt very helpful. Youre gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Jim| Was that not the--
Robert| All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
Jim| Mm-hm.
Robert| And there are no rules to that game. That wasnt so perverted, now was it?
Jim| Was that it? No, that wasnt bad.
Robert| My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesnt he decide who the manager is?
Jim| No. I wouldve said no.
Nellie| Mm, lets see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Kelly| Oh, great.
Jim| I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That its okay for someone to just take someone elses job? Shouldnt work like that.
Dwight| No, you know what? Nellies right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Darryl| No.
Dwight| Yes.
Darryl| No.
Dwight| Yes.
Darryl| No.
Dwight| Yes.
Darryl| No.
Dwight| Yes.
Darryl| No.
Dwight| Yes. Yes, sorry too late. Im here. This is mine. Back off.
Dwight|  Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Dwight|  Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Creed| Touch me and Ill sue.
Erin| Ive heard thats amazing when it works.
Andy| Yeah, if I had my own--
Erin| Andy, I care about you and I think--
Andy| --sorry, you go.
Erin| No, go ahead.
Andy| Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each others mouth. Its just stupid. What were you going to say?
Erin| Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Andy| You broke my heart too.
Erin| You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that were not meant to be.
Andy| Im so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
Erin| I know.
Andy| 
Nellie| So, Pamela, Im going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Pam| Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the managers position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. Im easy.
Nellie| Thats not really what you want. What you want is a good nights sleep, working mother of two.
Pam| Whoa, thats kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Nellie| Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Pam| Well, I mean, the only reason he doesnt is because Im breastfeeding, and Phillip doesnt like a bottle.
Nellie| You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
Pam| No.
Nellie| Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. Theres a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. Ill wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Pam| I think... youre a witch.
Nellie| I think youre amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it â€œIm amazing.â€
Pam|  Im amazing. 
Irene| Erin, I think youre making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.
Erin| Really? cause youve been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Irene| I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And hes willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--
Erin| Irene, what would you do without me?
Irene| Were not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenns going to sue Home Depot.
Erin| Why?
Irene| He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
Nellie| Jim, time for your review.
Jim| No, its not, because you dont really work here.
Nellie| Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldnt you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Jim| Yeah, thats the thing. I dont know if you can even give raises.
Nellie| Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Jim| Yes.
Nellie| Im Tinkerbell.
Jim| No.
Nellie| Mm-hm. Im a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Stanley| And we are grateful.
Nellie| But heres the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesnt exist.
Jim| She dies.
Nellie| She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Jim| Lets see it. Show of hands.
Kevin| I do.  Come on everyone...
Jim| All right, guys, stop.
Meredith| I already spent the money.
Jim| How?
Kevin| Come on Jim, youre killing her!
All| We believe! We believe!
Robert| Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellies leadership. I believe. 
Andy| That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erins favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm.  Its biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
Erin| Andy wait!  Andy! Andy wait! Dont go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I dont love you. Im sorry.
Andy| Erin!
Erin| Andy. 
Erin| Lets get out of here.
Andy| Okay.
Erin| Lets go.
Andy| Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Erin| No, I dont have any stuff.
Andy| Like your toothbrush and stuff.
Erin| I dont have one.
Andy| You dont have a toothbrush?
Erin| No.
Andy| How do you not have a toothbrush?
Erin| I just... theres always one around.
Andy| You just use whichever one is sitting there?
Erin| I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Andy| Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Nellie| I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I dont work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, thats the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. Its just random.
