Gabe| Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight| Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why dont you just take estrogen?   There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you?  Mwah.
Gabe| I remember when people thought biceps were all that. Theyd flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight| Oh, I bet you think its all about core, huh?
Gabe| Yeah.
Dwight| Oh, please.
Gabe| Cores critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One â€“ lengthen. Two â€“ elongate.
Jim| Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Whos the strongest? Well, theres only one way to solve that â€“ flat curl contest.
Jim| All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Dwight| Feast on this, Lewis.
Gabe| I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Jim| Come on, Gabe, you cant handle his hamstrings. Youre getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Gabe| Speed set. One. Two.
Jim| Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight| Oh, thank you.
Jim| Youre welcome.
Gabe| Five. Six.
Jim| Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All| Eight, nine, ten.
Gabe| We got it?
Dwight| Very funny Jim.
Gabe| Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Robert| Everyone, conference room, now.  
Jim| All right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight| I dont need your help.
Jim| Okay. You dont need my help?
Dwight| Here, here Just
Andy| Morning.
Erin| Hey.
Andy| Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot these.
Erin| Oh.
Andy| You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin| Andy, if youre gonna hang out for a while, uh
Andy| Whats this?
Erin| This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy| Is this Roberts attempt to embarrass me?
Erin| No, of course not. Its just â€“ I think its like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, its like, where does it end? So just 
Andy| Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, theyre rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told its a little much? Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because thats what it feels like.
Jim| All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight| Good, we have a deal?
Jim| Thanks Janet.
Dwight| Thanks so much Earl.
Jim| Wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight| And they said it couldnt be done. Boom!
Jim| Screw â€˜em.
Andy| Lot going on guys. Whats happening?
Jim| Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy| That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. Its like a festival of poo.
Jim| Hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight| Yeah, and were not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim| In the fridge.
Dwight| No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim| Sorry, man, I cant focus on zingers. Theres too many potential clients.
Stanley| You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis| Yeah, the Syracuse branch cant be happy youre taking New York clients.
Robert| Shh shh 
Jim| Robert?
Oscar| Why did Binghamton close?
Robert| Can everyone just, please I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and â€“ how should I say this â€“ Columbian whites. What â€“ what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Kevin| The branch closed. Forever.
Robert| Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, Im not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
Nellie| I got your voicemail. From â€“ from last night.
Robert| Wonderful.
Nellie| And the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. 
Robert| Pam, whens the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldnt hold the memories in?
Pam| Oh, it was this summer â€“
Robert| Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Pam| Um, I am a little busy.
Robert| Yes, â€˜course. Why dont you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam| Yeah, I can make you a list.
Robert| Lets do it now. Whats number one?
Pam| Why dont I help you now?
Robert| There we go.
Pam| Okay.
Jim| The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight| Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim| Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight| Yes.
Jim| Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. 
Dwight|  There he is. Thats Lloyd.
Toby| Me?
Creed| Yeah, you.
Harry| Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby| Now, were actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Toby| I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesnt back down from anybody. And he calls people â€œKimosabeâ€. 
Harry| Theyre New York. Were New York. Sate line is the dividing line. Thats the way its always been.
Jim| Theres actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight| Thats true.
Toby| Thats true. Theres no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Toby| No.
Dwight| Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I couldve choked so many people by now.
Harry| Stay out of my state. Its in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby| Ive seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Harry| Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
Toby| Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. 
Jim| How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Harry| Roberts here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I dont think we were doing that.
Dwight| Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jims leg.
Robert| Wheres the Advil, Jim? I think Ive hit my limit on the Tylenol â€“ Oh.
Andy|  Sorry, not Jim.
Robert| Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Andy| Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert| Oh, for god â€“
Harry| Robert California. What a surprise youre here in Scranton.
Robert| Harry
Harry| So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Robert| How do you mean?
Andy| I forgot, a a pan, uh â€“
Harry| No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Robert| Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. Theres no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems so poorly timed.
Dwight| Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Harry| Listen, Robert, I dont have time. Theres a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions â€“
Dwight| Dont listen to him.
Harry| Used to be Binghamtons â€“
Dwight| Nope.
Harry| I want it, its mine.
Dwight| Prestige is ours. Okay, theyre responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Harry| We need you to make a decision.
Dwight| Make a decision.
Robert| I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said 
Andy| Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client.  I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
Robert| Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there?  They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. Ill still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
Harry| Is it just me or is our boss a freakin weirdo?  Im gonna get some air.
Dwight| Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Jim|  Hes running!
Dwight| Damn it!
Jim| Damn it.
Dwight| Wha â€“ what is this supposed to be?
Jim| Its a monkey.
Dwight| Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. Its got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Jim| Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Dwight| What?
Jim| Is that him?
Dwight| Its him! Do something! Get out!
Jim| What? What am I gonna do? I dont â€“
Dwight| Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood.  Thats it? Oh, thats great. Thats like a five second delay.
Jim| Dwight!
Dwight| Come on, lets go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Jim| Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight| Yeah.
Jim| Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Dwight| Hit the nos.
Jim| Are you sure?
Dwight| Yes.
Jim| Brace yourself. 3 2
Dwight| Got it. Go.
Jim| 1. Here we go! 
Andy| Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Receptionist| Oh, do you have an appointment?
Andy| No, I do not.
Receptionist| Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
Andy| Seriously? â€˜Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Receptionist| Hes really not that busy.
Mr. Ramish| Is there someone here to see me?
Receptionist| Yes, this man.
Mr. Ramish| Come on in. 
Pam| Sowhat do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Nellie| Oh. Oh, Ill tell you what he does.
Angela|  Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Dont worry, I wont lay an egg.
Angela| Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? 
Angela| I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Gabe| Did someone say girl talk? 
Gabe| Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Gabe| Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? Im pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Nellie| Do you think Id like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Gabe| Uh, I think youre gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah.  Itll be upsetting if you dont.
Andy| Im a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Mr. Ramish| Why havent I heard of you? You got any references?
Andy| No. Im a rogue.
Mr. Ramish| Uh-huh.
Andy| Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now  I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Mr. Ramish| Every salesman Ive ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy| Of course they have. Which is why Im giving you a key to my house.  Whatever you need â€“ anytime, night or day â€“ you just stop on by.
Mr. Ramish| You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Andy| Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Dwight| Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
Dwight|  Ahhh! 
Jim| You all right?
Dwight| Yeah.  Oh.
Jim| Ah! 
Jim|  Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight| Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
Jim| What are you talking about?
Dwight| Just run! Take the stairs!
Jim| I dont even know where the stairs are!
Dwight| Ill stall him. Go!
Jim| God!
Harry|  What are you doing?
Dwight| Im gonna activate the seismic failsafe. Well be stuck between floors for hours.  Oh.  My pants fell down.
Jim| What?
Dwight| My pants fell down! I dont have a belt!
Dwight|  Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Mr. Ramish| Whats going on? 
Dwight| Well â€“
Harry| Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse â€“
Dwight| I was here first.
Mr. Ramish| Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
Dwight| I already made an appointment with your secretary.
Mr. Ramish| Let me stop you all right here. Ive already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight| Wait, its not D.M Utica, is it?
Mr. Ramish| No, no, its not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. Its Big Red Paper Company.
Jim| Big Red Paper Company?
Mr. Ramish| Mm-hmm.
Andy| Yes, yes, yes!
Harry| Give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight| Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim| All right, guys. It didnt work out for any of us, so were still on the same team. Let me get these.
Dwight| No. Let him get his own. Its Syracuse money.
Harry| You know, your partners got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Dwight| Jim couldnt land me in a thousand years.
Jim| But youre saying theres a chance.
Dwight| Shut up.
Pam|  Hey.
Robert| Hmm.
Pam| I stole Nellies phone.
Robert| Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam| What do you want from me?
Robert| Now we get to the bottom of Nellies â€œyes, yes, yes, yes, never.â€
Phone| Hi, Nell, its mom. Do keep your chin up. It cant be as bad as you described.
Robert| Oh yes it can.
Phone| This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Robert| Shopaholic.
Pam| Sounds like it.
Robert| Yeah.
Phone| Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
Robert| Ah.
Phone| This is Annie from second nests. Im sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, were gonna hold out for that.
Pam| Okay, thats enough. 
Robert| Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Pam| No, no, no!
Robert| No, come on.
Pam| Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. Theyre all deleted.
Robert| Pam, Pam, youve completely bungled this!
Pam| Ah. Ahh. 
Pam| Hey.
Nellie| Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Pam| Um yes. Definitely. With your hair â€“
Nellie| Oh!
Pam| Certainly. Um you dropped your cell phone.
Nellie| Oh, gosh.
Pam| Yep.
Nellie| Thank you. Im so stupid.
Pam| No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Nellie| Oh, god, Pam. Dont get me started.
Pam| No, I will not.
Nellie| Youve just got me started. Robert is a filthy beast. I mean, dont you get the feeling, hes just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Pam| Well â€“
Nellie| I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Pam| But sometimes he talks about flesh and bacchanals. 
Nellie| I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Pam| No dont. Just put it out of your mind.
Nellie| Pam, what is your address? Im gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You dont â€“
Nellie| Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Nellie| Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Robert|  Erin.
Erin| Theres a call for you on line one.
Robert| Who is it?
Erin| He says salvation. No last name.
Robert| Yeah, hello?
Andy|  You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Dont, and I will find another buyer.
Robert| Youre blackmailing me.
Andy| Its just business.
Robert| Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. Youre gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You dont even know my real name. Im the *bleep* lizard king. 
Andy| Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. 
David|  Andy Bernard.
Andy| You got a minute?
David| Um Im in the middle of a piano lesson.
Andy| I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
David| Dunder Mifflin.  Now why would I want that? Its worth half of what it was three years ago.
Andy| Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
David| Why dont you come in? 
Harry| So what would you do if you werent selling paper?
Jim| Oh, man, Id have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Dwight| What?
Jim| Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Dwight| How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You dont even care about nationals.
Harry| Nothing?
Jim| I dont know. Ive always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Harry| Id like to sell one big thing, you know? Like a plane. One sale, Im out.
Jim| That sounds lovely.
Harry| Anyway, Roberts gonna run this company into the ground, so We wont be doing this in six months.
