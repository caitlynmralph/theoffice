Michael| Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Pam| Michael we dont know what youre talking about...
Michael| Wet cement, outside. Its drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
Kevin| Michael you could put your initials in it.
Michael| M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I dont...
Jim| Yeah thats true.
Michael| Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Phyllis| We-- we--
Michael| Here we go!
Phyllis| Well--
Michael| Lets, yes?
Phyllis| When I was a little girl...
Michael| Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Lets hear it!
Phyllis| We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Michael| Its drying, its drying...
Phyllis| In our neighborhood...
Michael| Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
Phyllis| What did we write?
Michael| Ahh come on!
Andy| Here it is, you should draw a picture...
Michael| No!
Andy| Cause that says, that says...
Michael| No!
Andy| So much more than words...
Michael| No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Kelly| Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Michael| Pam, translate.
Pam| Shes talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Michael| I love it!
Jim| If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Michael| I love it more!
Oscar| Michael that doesnt seem... safe.
Michael| I... love it!! Haha, come on!
Dwight| Come on!
Jim| We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Michael|  Hurry, please.
Jim| Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Dwight| Can you breathe?
Jim| Well thats not true. Other people believe its deeper inside...
Dwight| Hold your breath.
Jim| And in this case...
Dwight| Ready?
Jim| Thats also not true.
Dwight| And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can.
Michael|  Thats what she said.
Michael| Today is a very special day for me. And its really not about me, its about my grandkids, its about my great grandkids... I can come back here when Im 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "Thats me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, its a good feeling.
Andy|  Okay, adjective...
Angela| Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
Andy| Good one. Okay, you ready?
Angela| Mmhmm.
Andy|  The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"
Angela|  Its a man eating cat food.
Andy| What about a cat eating man food?
Dwight| Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Pam|  Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friends house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
Michael| All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. Youre moving in the wrong direction...
Pam| I dont have my contacts...
Michael| Ub, dub dah, dont need, I cant even hear you. Its just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, were going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
Michael| Ener-gize...
Jim| You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Pam| Dont, dont--
Jim| Would...
Pam| If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Jim| Well, its too late, because Im proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Michael| Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I havent done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Andy| What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
Michael| Zing and pep, see thats those are the kind of words were looking for. Yes, Jim?
Jim| What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Michael| Now were cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Jim| An urban thing...
Michael| An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Stanley| Not me.
Michael| Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
Stanley| No.
Michael| Stanley, were havin a little...
Stanley| Leave me alone, dammit.
Michael| Were havin a little brainstorm session...
Stanley| DID I STUTTER?
Michael| ...Good, this is good. Im going to grab a glass of water.
Toby| Can I talk to you a second?
Michael| Ugh, what?
Toby| Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Michael| What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Toby| Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
Michael| That? In the conference room?
Toby| Yeah.
Michael| We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
Toby| He didnt seem like he was joking.
Michael| Well you dont get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and youre... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another "Hey um, youre poor." "Well hey, youre mamas dead." Thats what friends do. Its... youre so white.
Toby| Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
Michael| Mmhmm.
Toby| Um, why dont you go ask him that?
Michael| Okay, I will... Im not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Toby| You know, Michael, sometimes my daughters stomach hurts when theres a mean girl at school...
Michael| Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so its probably psychological.
Andy| You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and theres an Xterra next to you. Theyre always driven by chicks, so theres your icebreaker.
Dwight|  Unh! Scratch.
Andy| Thats a racing stripe.
Dwight| Uh, bumpers sagging.
Andy| Mmm, I doubt that very much.
Dwight| This cars crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Andy| How next to?
Dwight| Well, here are your options you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that youd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and Ill use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
Andy| I have to pick one of those?
Dwight| Yes.
Andy| Can you go over those options again?
Dwight| You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. Its gotta be now.
Andy| Well I have the, the blue book value...
Dwight| Seal the deal. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Three, two, one--
Andy| Can I think about it?
Dwight| Five, four, three, two...
Andy| Let me think about it--
Dwight| Now. Now. Now.
Andy| Let me think about it--
Dwight| Say it. Do it. Now.
Andy| Im thinking about it--
Dwight| Do it now.
Andy| Thinking--
Dwight| Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Andy| Yeah. All right!
Stanley| What.
Michael| I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Stanley| What are you talking about?
Michael| Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didnt mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole things silly, isnt it? Friends dont need to apologize to friends as far as Im concerned, so we are cool.
Stanley| I am not going to apologize to you.
Stanley| Its like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think Im wrong, and if you dont like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and Ill say it to my next one too.
Dwight| Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Michael| Uh huh...
Dwight| There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Michael| Great
Dwight| However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Michael| Whats the pink?
Dwight| Menstrual cycles.
Michael| Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Dwight| You.
Michael| Other than me.
Dwight| Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Michael| I never said you could do that.
Dwight| All you have to do it say it.
Michael| I...
Dwight| Just say it.
Michael| Okay, I will think about it.
Dwight| Say it. Just do it. Dont think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Michael| No.
Dwight| So... All right, well, youre gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Kevin| Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
Pam| Oh, thanks.
Kevin| All the girlfriends that Ive ever had have worn glasses.
Pam| Oh, okay...
Kevin| Yeah, its kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Pam| I should probably get back to...
Kevin| Like librarians.
Pam| Entering the....
Kevin| Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"?
Pam| No.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.
Creed| A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobodys business. Id like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. Id also like to see her topless.
Darryl| Mike.
Michael| Hey.
Darryl| Im very busy here, man.
Michael| Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
Darryl| Why?
Michael| Its an advice question, and if you dont wanna talk about it, I completely understand. Its, um...
Darryl| No, no, no...
Michael| I know, its very, very personal...
Darryl| No, um... I have.
Michael| I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Darryl| Both.
Michael| God.
Darryl| Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Michael| Okay.
Darryl| Newsies.
Michael| Okay, so dig this youre on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
Darryl| Oh my goodness.
Michael| Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Darryl| Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
Michael| What is that?
Darryl| Thats when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Michael| Really?
Darryl| Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon youre laughing and hugging. Before you know it, youve forgotten the whole thing. Yall can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Michael| I wouldve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Darryl| Well, its effective.
Ryan|  I think its self-explanatory.  Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Jim| Oh boy...
Ryan| How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Jim| On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
Ryan| Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Jim| A formal warning...
Ryan| Its actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldnt be having this conversation.
Jim|  Im sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didnt mean to go over your head.
Ryan| This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Jim| Im sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause Im not sure whats really...
Ryan| Woah, dont get all defensive, alright? Its just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Toby| Id say all the goofing around at Pams desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Pam| Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
Jim| Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Pam| Because youre very important?
Jim| Yeah...
Dwight|  Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! Whats Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
Andy| What the hell is this all about?  Youre flipping my car for profit.
Dwight| Its my car now.
Andy| I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Dwight| Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if youll excuse me, Ive got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Dwight| Ive got a Madlib for you a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
Michael| Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Pam| What does that mean?
Michael| Its like a mock execution.
Jim| Thats not a good idea.
Michael| Yes it is a good idea. Its the only possible solution I have left.
Toby| Well, you can actually fire him.
Michael| No, okay... Ive had enough of you.
Oscar| Why are you telling us this?
Michael| Because I want you to behave as if Im actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Kevin| Michael, if you hadnt told us this, then we wouldve thought that you were actually firing him.
Michael| Im not firing him. Im not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what Im going to do, is Im going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? Im teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? Thats all Im, okay, here he comes. Lets just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
Michael| Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
Stanley| Are you serious?
Michael| I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Stanley| Youre firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think Im gonna let you do this to me?
Michael| Hmm.
Stanley| Ive watched you screw up this office for ten years, and Im filing a lawsuit, and Im gonna tell them about every stupid thing youve ever done up in this office.
Michael| Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
Stanley| So Im not fired.
Michael| Thats it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Stanley| Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Michael| Okay...
Stanley| Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Michael| Yes.
Stanley| Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Michael| Thats not-
Stanley| And I think, "theres no possible way--
Michael| All right, all right...
Stanley| He can top that."
Michael| Okay.
Stanley| But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Michael| Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Jim| Who?
Michael| Everybody, except Stanley.
Jim| Lets go.
Pam| I cant find my glasses.
Jim| Okay, you know what? Why dont you take my hand, and leave them, and lets get out of here.
Pam| Okay, okay.
Kevin|  Its Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and hes mad. So thats about it!
Michael|  I dont understand why you keep picking on me.
Stanley| Oh, for the love of God.
Michael| You just, do, and I dont know why, so... please help me understand.
Stanley| Fine. Here it is you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Michael| Well Stanley, maybe youre feeling that you dont respect me because you dont know me very well.
Stanley| Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more Ive gotten to know you, the less Ive come to respect you. Any other theories?
Michael| All right, you dont respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you cant talk to me that way in this office, you just cant. I am your boss. Cant allow it.
Stanley| Fair enough.
Michael| I am good person, and sometimes, good people dont get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I dont get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I dont respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what dont get no respect? Airplane food. Why dont they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife dont get no respect, some--take her, please, for example.  If you dont get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  Whats the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I dont get no respect!
Michael| So Im thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
Stanley| Has potential to be your best idea yet.
Phyllis| Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard.
Michael| Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
