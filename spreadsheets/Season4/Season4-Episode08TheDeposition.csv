Oscar| So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again-
Michael| Ill call back.
Kevin| You never call back.
Pam| Every time Michaels in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him whos on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesnt get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Michael|  Yeah, um, tell him Ill call him back.
Jan|
Michael| You cant always work 200 days though.
Michael|  Oh, no, no, no, I dont have time for this. Tell him Im in a meeting.
Ryan| You have to know how to work this. Theres no excuse for this.
Michael| Yep.
Ryan| I can get you a tutor if you need-
Michael| Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
Ryan| Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Michael| N-No, money isnt everything Ryan. And youre my friend, and I dont want to be rude.
Ryan| Take the call, friend.
Michael| I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Ryan| I insist you take your work calls.
Michael| Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.
Jan| I dont know, its just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? Its such a...boys club.
Michael| Yeah, I hate that.
Jan| Good.
Michael| So, heres the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jans wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Jan| And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Michael| Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. Thats how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? Im feeling a little queasy.
Jan| Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Michael| Well-
Jan| Remember, it isnt just a pattern, Its a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Michael| Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Jan| Does this work for you?
Michael| Yep. Tell them how much youre gonna get if you win.
Jan| Uh, come on Micheal, thats tacky.
Michael| Million dollars!
Jan| Four million.
Michael| Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jans answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like its not memorized.
Jan| No, Michael. Oh, come on.
Michael| Perfect crime.
Jan| Stop saying ridiculous things. Hes just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldnt leave anything up to chance or Michaels judgment.
Michael| Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
Jan| Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Michael| Im getting car sick! Ugh, Im gonna puke. I think Im gonna throw up.
Jan| All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
Michael| Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Lester| A good start. And I think its busload.
Michael| Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Ryan| Hey Michael.
Michael| Hey hey.
Ryan| Im glad youre here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Ryan| Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Michael| I would love that.
Ryan| Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now youve been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you wont do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Michael| Abso-fruitley. Yeah. Ill-Ill do anything for the company.
Ryan| Good. That is great to hear.
Michael| It is.
Darryl|  Game, son!
Jim| All right, lets run it back.
Pam| The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Kelly| What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Pam| Hi, Kelly.
Kelly| Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Pam| I dont wanna guess.
Kelly| Ill give you a hint Its not my boyfriend. I think its a guy over here .
Kelly| I dont talk trash, I talk smack. Theyre totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like Youre ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
Pam| Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Jim| Sure.
Jim| Wow.
Pam| Okay, its not regulation size, but itll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
Jim| Oh, I cant beat Darryl.
Pam| Please? Kellys trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Jim| What, seriously? What is she saying?
Kelly|  Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
Kelly|  Jim couldnt hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Kelly|  Were Jims parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Jim| So youre asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Pam| Sorta, yes.
Jim| Bring me players.
Pam| Okay.
Diane Kelly| Hi everyone, Im Diane Kelly. Im the companys chief legal counsel.
Michael| Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
Diane| Toby?
Michael| Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Toby| Michael, Im your HR Rep. Im on your side.
Michael| Never. I want him gone. I dont talk until he leaves.
Jan| Michael, just relax, okay?
Diane| You know, I think theyre, uh ready for us now. So..
Michael| Okay. All right.
Deposition Reporter| Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Michael| Yessh.
Lester| Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinsons termination?
Michael| Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Lester| Oh. Very good. Well put.
Jan| People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
Pam| Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
Kevin| About what?
Pam| He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
Kevin| Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Pam| Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. Hes in the conference room.
Kevin|  Oh, awesome!
Lester| How long have you known the plaintiff?
Michael| I havent actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Lester| How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
Michael| Six years and two months.
Lester| And you were directly under her the entire time?
Michael| Thats what she said.
Lester| Excuse me?
Michael| Thats what she said.
Lester| Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
Michael| Uh, wh-why would she say that?
Jan| Can we just move on to another question?
Diane| No wait, I dont understand. Whos on record on saying this?
Lester| With all due respect, Im in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.
Michael| Come again? Thats what she said? I dont know what youre talking about.
Jan| Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Lester| Oh, are you sure?
Jan| Uh, yes.
Lester| Can you go back to where this digression began?
Deposition Reporter|  Mr. Schneider And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott Thats what she said.
Michael| Well, delivery is all wrong. Shes butchering it.
Kelly|  Yeah, thats what I thought.
Lester| Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?
Michael| She thought it had to do with the twins. Thats what I call them.
Lester| Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?
Michael| Um, to be delicate, they hang off miladys chest. They... make milk.
Lester| You dont need to go any further. Her breasts.
Michael| Yes.
Lester| She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
Michael| Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
Lester| What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
Michael| Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
Lester| Interesting. How so?
Michael| Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
Diane| Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if thats okay with you?
Michael| I will allow it.
Diane| Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please.
Michael| Uh...
Diane| That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?
Michael| Uh-huh.
Diane| And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?
Michael| Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, thats like six years ago. If its from the first time we kissed, thats like two years ago.
Diane| Wait, excuse me?
Michael| If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
Lester| Could we take a short break?
Diane| No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?
Michael| Line.
Diane| Im sorry, what?
Man| He asked for a line, like in a play.
Deposition Reporter|  "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No." "I really have to, Ive been drinking lots of water." "You went five minutes ago." "That wasnt to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question." "You still have to answer it." "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No."
Jim| Good game Meredith.
Meredith| Dont patronize me.
Dwight| All right! What is going on here?
Jim| Dwight! Thank God youre here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
Jim|  What the hell?
Dwight| I told you.
Dwight| All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, Jörg Roßkopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
Michael| Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Diane Kelly| Thank you, Mr. Scott. Thats all we needed to know.
Lester| Wait, wed like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scotts personal journal.
Michael| Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Lester| This is plaintiffs exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I dont know if its going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie."
Michael| Irie.
Lester| Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael." It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?
Diane Kelly| Were gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Michael| I dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
Diane Kelly| Its basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Man| OK, lets make ten copies of this diary.
Toby| Um, can you make it eleven?
Man| Eleven, sure. And well break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
Michael|  Can I sit here?
Toby|  ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what youre going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I dont know, I didnt want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted...
Michael| How can you give up my diary like that?
Jan| I had to, Im sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Michael| Howd you even find it?
Jan| You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Michael| I dont like lump. Im really upset about this.
Jan| Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Lets call it even.
Michael| Fine. I love you.
Jan| I love you too.
Diane Kelly|  Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as "Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
Michael| Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
Lester| Arent we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.
Toby|  Excuse me.
Michael| Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
Diane Kelly| OK Mr. Scott, its, its admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
Michael| Thank you very much. You didnt have to say that.
Diane Kelly| Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Michael| That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
Diane Kelly| Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please?
Michael| March 17th.
Diane Kelly| And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Michael| Yes.
Diane Kelly| You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if youd like to.
Michael|  "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
Diane Kelly| Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldnt you say Ms. Levinsons judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
Michael|
Diane Kelly| Mr. Scott?
Pam|  Hows it going?
Dwight| Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
Jim| Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Pam| Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Jim| I think Im ready.
Pam| Ill make the call.
Dwight| Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
Jim| ...Right. Spin-serve!
Michael| How can you do that to me?
Jan|
Lester| You can respond, just remember its all going into the record.
Jan| Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Michael| Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
Jan| Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallaces deposition.
Lester| Starting at paragraph 6. Council "Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson?" David Wallace "Yes."
Michael| See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Lester| Council "Was he your first choice?" David Wallace "Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years."
Council| "Was he in the top 5 of contenders?" David Wallace "What do you want me to say? Come on, hes a nice guy. There were many people that I considered." Council "Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace "No."
Lester| I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldnt you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
Michael| ...Absolutely not.
Pam|  Yes! Way to go.  See that?
Kelly| Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Darryl| 19, serving 4.
Kelly| Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one!  Hey, hey, you, you! I dont like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
Pam| You know what? Im sick of this! Lets go, you and me!
Kelly| What?
Pam| Lets go. Pick up a paddle.
Kelly| OK. Bring it on.
Pam| I am.
Kelly| Think you can handle this?
Pam| In my sleep.
Kelly| OK. Volley for serve, P.
Pam| O.   P.
Kelly| O.
Jim| Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Darryl| Yes.
David| Michael. I am very sorry.
Michael| Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
David Wallace| No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. Im very sorry.
Michael|  Hey, David?
David| Yeah?
Michael| I think youre a nice guy too.
David| Thanks, Michael.
Michael| Why did I do it? I dont know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
Michael|  What do you want to do for dinner?
Jan| How about Chinese?
Michael| Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Jan| That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Michael| Do you fast food?
Jan| Fine, fast foods fine.
