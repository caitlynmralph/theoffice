Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| I gotcha one.
Jim| Oh wow, thank you.
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Pam| No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?
Jim| I guess.  How dare you.
Michael| Hey Toby. Whats this?
Toby| Ohh.
Michael|  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Toby| Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Michael| Oh really.
Toby| ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind its not appropriate to, to do that.
Michael| Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think. I dont think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I dont think its any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Toby| Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Angela|  For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Toby| Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Michael|  No way.
Dwight| What?
Phyllis| You guys are together?
Jim| Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Michael| Woooah! Wow!
Andy| Tuna!
Michael| Awesome!
Kevin| I knew it!
Michael| You guys! Yes! Yes!
Pam| Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Toby| Yes.
Michael| Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Jim| Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
Michael| I love you guys, so much.
Jim| Ohh..
Pam| Phones ringing.
Michael| No, no, no Pam let em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
Dwight| I dont see it. I think they both could do better.
Angela| Its not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Andy| Jim Halperts off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Michael| Hey. Can you make that straighter? Thats what she said.
Phyllis| Did you plan it?
Michael| No.
Pam|  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Michael| Blowing up balloons I thought.
Pam| You might want to trim it a little.
Phyllis| Michael...
Kelly|  Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Pam| Yeah, he is.
Kelly| Oh.
Michael| Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Angela| What do you want?
Dwight| To give you this .
Angela| Oh, what is that?
Dwight| Its a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and Im giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Angela| Her name was Sprinkles.
Dwight| And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.  Dont you Garbage?
Angela| I cant believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before shes even in the ground.
Dwight| You havent buried her yet?
Angela| Dont rush me. Im grieving.
Dwight| Garbage can be very helpful. OK, hes a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him.
Angela| I dont want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
Pam| Hey Toby.
Toby| Hey...  you two.
Jim| Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
Toby| Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know  relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, theres no need, really.
Jim| Oh.
Pam| Well, I dont wanna speak for Jim, but, its like pretty official.
Toby| Uh huh.
Jim| Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Toby| Lets just wait and see what happens.  You know?
Jim| What?
Toby| Lets just wait.
Jim| Oh, OK.
Pam| OK.
Jim| Great.
Pam|  Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Ryan| Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! Its great to see you. Is Michael in?
Michael| Hey!
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| There he is! There he is! Hes back! And hes with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. Im Tubs.
Ryan| OK. Should we get started?
Michael| Ohh, yeah, lets get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Ryan| Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Michael| ...business meeting --
Kevin|  Fire!
Ryan| Stop that! Stop that!
Michael| Thats right! Thats right!
Ryan|  You scared me.
Michael| Fire guy. Dont start any fires, Ryan.
Andy| Fire guy
Kevin| You werent here for that.
Andy| Here for what?
Kevin| When he started the fire.
Michael| Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. Youre like our little man...
Kevin| Little old man boy.
Ryan| Michael and everybody, umm...
Michael| Beard.
Kevin| Bearded man boy.
Ryan| ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. Id like your respect. I am your boss now. Youre gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Michael| Oh, wow!
Ryan| So...
Michael| Thats a little kinky. I dont swing that way.
Ryan| OK...
Michael| Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Ryan| Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Michael| Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Lets get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
Ryan| Perfect.
Michael| Sounds good. OK, alright.
Michael| Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, were friends. Im doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And well always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
Ryan| Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Jim| Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, Im not really sure whats wrong with it.
Ryan| This is a massive overhaul. Were getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Michael| OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Ryan| Ill stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Dwight| What if we dont want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Ryan| This is company-wide, Dwight.
Dwight| Got it.
Ryan| Andy.
Andy| We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Ryan| Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor.
Kelly| Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Ryan| Thank you everybody.
Michael| Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.
Creed| Thats some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Ryan| As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Creed| Cool beans.
Creed| Were screwed.
Michael| Who is?
Creed| Us? You and me. The old timers.
Michael| I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Creed| Youre over 40, thats the cut off. Are you listening to what hes saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. Im telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, were goners.
Jim| Swore I wouldnt tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Pam| No..
Jim| Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Pam| No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque.
Jim| Wait. What?  You knew? And you didnt say anything?
Pam| You didnt say anything to me?
Jim| Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Pam| Can you believe that...
Phyllis| Sorry, I didnt know you guys were in here.
Jim| Oh no, were just sitting here.
Phyllis| I couldnt see your hands.  Hey Pam, by the way, its great that youre dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You cant base who gets new clients on who youre sleeping with that week, OK?
Pam| OK.
Phyllis| OK.
Jim| OK.
Jim| And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Ryan| OK, whats up?
Michael| Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Ryan| Well it is business, but not as usual.
Michael| Yeah, I know I understand... were making great strides and were updating, but business as usual, no?
Ryan| No.  Were throwing out the entire playbook, were starting from scratch, were implementing a brand new system.
Michael| Good, so, were on the same page?
Ryan| No. Were not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Michael| We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And thats who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
Ryan| So, how are you?
Kelly| Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Ryan| Good.
Kelly| A lot. Black guys mostly.
Ryan| Kelly...
Kelly| What?!
Phyllis| Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Stanley| I dont know.
Phyllis| Did you even try?
Stanley| If the kid wants to set mine up, Ill let him.
Phyllis| I cant see half of the things.
Stanley| Its too little. Use the phone.
Kelly| I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Ryan| Kelly, Im your boss now, OK? You cant keep talking to me like Im your boyfriend.
Kelly| Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I dont think you ever cared about me.
Ryan| I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Kelly| Well, I hope youre still committed because Im pregnant.
Kelly|
Kelly| And guess what buddy,  I am keeping it.
Ryan| OK. OK.
Kelly| Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Ryan| I can... I cant talk about this right now, OK? After work, well go out to dinner, well talk about it then, OK?
Kelly| We have a date!
Dwight| Hello.
Angela| Hello, Dwight. Ive been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Dwight| Really?
Angela| Yes.
Dwight| Ill make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Angela| I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Jan| Hi, Pam.
Pam| Hi.
Jan| Is Michael in?
Pam| In his office. You can go right in.
Jan|  Hey.
Ryan| Jan.
Jan| Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Ryan| So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Jan| Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Ryan| Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Jan| Different salary.  Youll get there, dont worry.
Ryan| Well... you look great.
Jan| Thank you, thank you.
Ryan| Scranton suits you.
Jan| Best decision I ever made.
Ryan| You were let go.
Jan| You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
Michael| Hey.
Jan| Hey.
Michael|  Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
Jan| What?
Michael| I dont want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Jan| So, whats Ryan doing here?
Michael| Oh, I dunno, theyre launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. Hes being a real twerp about it, so, its all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Jan| Hes such a snake.
Michael| Well...
Jan| I hope hes gets hit with an ageism suit.
Michael| What is that... word?
Jan| Ageism? Companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Michael| So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Jan| Yes, Michael, they do.
Oscar| Creed?
Creed| Yes, sir.
Oscar| Everything OK?
Creed| Everythings cool, dude.
Creed| Im thirty. Well, in November Ill be thirty.
Ryan| Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Pam| Michael told us to wait in here. We dont know why.
Ryan|  Ohh... man.
Michael| Good, were all here, we can get started.
Ryan| Michael.
Michael| Have a seat.
Ryan| Were not doing this today.
Michael| Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Ryan| OK. This is...
Michael| Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Toby| Technically, hes right.
Michael| Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Creed| Because theyre lame.
Michael| No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "wheres the Beef?"   Yeah.
Jim| Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Pam| Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
Michael| I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Pam| Oh.
Robert Dunder| Michael Scott?
Michael|  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Whos this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
Dwight| Oh, yeah. Yes!
Robert Dunder| Thank you everyone.
Ryan| Michael,  can I talk to you a second?
Michael| Sure thing.  Scuse me.
Ryan| We have actual work to do.
Michael| Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
Michael| Bob, how old are you?
Robert Dunder| Im 87.
Michael| Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
Robert Dunder| Well, I, I, I havent been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
Michael| Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
Dwight| Im gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
Robert Dunder| I started this company in 1949.
Michael| Wow.
Robert Dunder| Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
Michael| Oh, boy.
Robert Dunder| And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
Michael| Great.
Robert Dunder| And he was, he was  at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
Michael| Great.
Robert Dunder| And...
Michael| Thats great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Robert Dunder| Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
Michael| Perfect.
Robert Dunder| Well, cou, could you get me another...
Michael| Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks, because its illegal, and you will go to jail.
Pam| I think that I should help him get home.
Michael| No, No. Dont help him. He doesnt need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
Michael| Good night guys.
Ryan| Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Michael| I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Ryan| Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Michael| I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ryan| Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go?
Kelly| You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Ryan| Kelly, come on.
Kelly| You know what, youre right. Im feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.
Dwight| Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Angela| Very much. Hows your meat?
Dwight| Dry. Delicious.
Angela| I heard a joke today.
Dwight| Oh, thats funny.
Angela| Yes, it was.
Dwight| Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Angela| I cant do this. I cant be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles stiff lifeless body.
Dwight| Then dont look in my eyes. Look right here , its an old sales trick.
Angela| Im sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Dwight| No, please dont do this, monkey.
Angela| I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
Toby| Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Pam| Hi.
Jim| Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
Pam| Nice to meet you.
Jim|  Nice to meet you.
Toby|  This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
Amy| Yeah, sure. Ill, uh, Ill see you tonight, right?
Toby| Absolutely.
Amy| Whoa.  Easy tiger.
Toby| I just really like you.
Amy| Okay.  Bye guys.  Nice to meet you.
Toby| Have a great day!
Pam| Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  Youre going to violate your own PDA memo.
Toby| I wouldnt want to do that now would I?
Michael| Smell that. Do you smell that?
Dwight| Dry rot?
Michael| No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Andy| Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
Michael| Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. Ill explain, later.
Michael| Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IMs, but I think hes forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
Dwight| Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Angela| Thank you.
Dwight| Youre welcome.
Angela| Is that all?
Dwight| Yes...  I miss you.
Angela| Elevators.
Angela| Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Dwight| Fine.  Then I just want to be friends.
Angela| Good.
Dwight| Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Angela|
Kelly| I dont understand what the big deal is.
Ryan| You dont?
Kelly| No!
Ryan| You lied about being pregnant.
Kelly| Right, so?
Ryan| You really dont understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Kelly| No!
Ryan| Were never getting back together.
Kelly| Why not?
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Alright I just have to ask now that were public, um, is the magic gone?
Pam| Its funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Jim| I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Pam| I think... I mean, I dont know what it is but...
Jim| Be honest.
Pam| I now find you repulsive.
Jim| Thats honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?
Pam| Eh...
Jim| For me, it was.
Pam| OK.
Jim| Alright.
Michael| Hey boss, I didnt know you were coming in today.
Ryan| Whats, uh, going on here?
Michael| I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
Ryan| With gift baskets.
Michael| With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? Thats what people like.
Michael| Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I cant do things. "You cant be on the team", "You cant move on to second grade". Well, now theyre telling me that I cant win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  Well see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
Michael| OK. Were gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
Stanley| Im not driving with him.
Andy| Ill go with you Stanley.
Stanley| Or him.
Jim| Why dont we just go by ourselves?
Michael| Why dont we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Phyllis| Michael.
Michael| Yes?
Phyllis| This is stupid.
Michael| OK, thats not helpful Phyllis.
Phyllis| How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Michael| Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
Andy| What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... its kind of the best gift ever.
Jim| What about a gift basket full of cash?
Andy| Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Michael| Fine, Im just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
Dwight| Michael, wait. Let me go.
Michael| No, this is my quest.
Dwight| Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please.
Michael| Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Ryan| Good luck Michael.
Michael| We dont need luck.
Dwight| Yeah.
Michael| But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Dwight| Thank you.
Michael| Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
Ryan|  Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand thats confusing.
Creed|  Hey brah, Ive been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guys gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
Dwight|  Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Michael| It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Dwight| Ah, thats a pain in the ass.
Michael| I know. So whos next?
Dwight| Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
GPS| Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
Dwight| Why do you use that thing? Lets them know where you are at all times.
Michael| Who?
Dwight| The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
Ryan| Next night, Im out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure Ill get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night.  I run into Vince Vaughn.
Kevin| No way!
Ryan| Literally.
Andy| Dude, you are so money, but you dont even know it, but you do.
Ryan| ... Later guys.
Kevin| Yeah, later dude.
Andy| Later man.
Kevin| Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
Jim| Yeah, hes definitely something.
Kevin| What does that mean?
Jim| That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Andy| Ha! Tuna...  Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Kevin| Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Andy| He has a killer job, hes rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Kevin| And he can get any girl that he wants.
Andy| So, sorry Tuna but if you dont know why thats awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
Kevin| Tuna. Check you later.
Michael|  Wow, those things are heavy! Theres a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
Larry Myers| You know we closed our account with you right?
Michael| Yes we do.
Larry Myers| Were with Office Depot now.
Dwight| Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Michael| Well...
Dwight| And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Michael| Mmhmm.
Larry Myers| OK. I dont think were coming back.
Dwight| Please, come back.
Michael| OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Dwight| Remember what we had Larry?
Larry Myers| I mean, really its about money.
Michael| Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
Larry Myers| OK thanks.
Michael| Alright.
Larry Myers| I mean their website is really easy to use too. Thats a big deal for us.
Michael|  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Dwight| I dont know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Michael| That is true.
Dwight| Like Angela in accounting.
Michael| Yes, she is nuts.
Dwight| Ugh... no, shes wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
GPS| Make the next right turn.
Michael| How do they know? How does this know where to turn? Thats very impressive.
Ryan| Hey Pam. I havent settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know youre into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Pam| Uh totally.
Ryan| Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and Ill take a look?
Pam| Yeah.
Ryan| Thank you very much.
Pam| Thank you.
Ryan| Cool.
Pam| OK.
Pam| Yeah, Im gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I dont know what Im talking about but Im excited.
Michael| And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
Ex-client| You know I have heard it before.
Michael| Ah, well its still very good. I bet I know someone who hasnt heard that joke... your daughter Emily. Hows she doing?
Ex-client| Shes great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
Michael| Shes gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I dont want to take any more of your time, I know youre a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Ex-client| Oh, OK.
Michael| OK, OK! So youll reconsider?
Ex-client| OK thanks for the goodies.
Michael| Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Ex-client| It looks delicious? I dont know.
Dwight| You dont know?
Michael| Look, we want you back.
Ex-client| Can you offer lower prices?
Michael| Well, no.
Ex-client| Then were not coming back.
Dwight| Hes not coming back, its over Michael.
Michael| No its not.
Ex-client| No hes right.
Dwight| Accept it, why would he come back?
Michael| Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because youre definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Dwight| Thats not gonna change his mind. Hes moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Michael| Look... were also coming out with a website soon. Its a state of the art thing, itll be up and running, its gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
Ex-client| Oh, OK. Well when its up, Ill check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe well come back.
Michael| Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Ex-client| That I dont care about as much. Let me know when the sites up.
Michael| OK, good. Dont let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, shes alergic.
GPS| Proceed straight.
Dwight|  Well were O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Michael| I dont get it, I really dont get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Dwight| Thats how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Michael| That is a very good point, Dwight.
GPS| Make a right turn.
Dwight| Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Michael| No, it said right, it said take a right.
Dwight| No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Michael| Maybe its a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
Dwight| It cant mean that! Theres a lake there!
Michael| The machine knows where it is going!
Dwight| This is the lake!
Michael| The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Dwight| No, its--- theres no road here!
Dwight| Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael!
Michael| Let go, let go of me!
Dwight| I got you, I got you!
Michael|  You sure youre OK?
Dwight| Fine.
Michael| Good, that is whats most important.
Dwight| Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Michael| What a disaster, this whole thing.
Dwight| Ill call a cab.
Michael| These people just dont realize what a gift basket means, they dont get it.
Dwight| Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Michael| What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I dont even know if I want it. Theyre website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Dwight|  Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Michael| Hang up.  You know what were gonna do? Were walking back. Were walking back to that office and were gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| Were gonna take whats rightfully ours! Were gonna take a stand, Dwight! Were gonna take a stand!
Dwight| Take a stand!
Pam| So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? Id love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
Ryan| I like it a lot. Its clear and subtle at the same time. Its really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Pam| Thanks.
Ryan| Id love to talk to you about it more.
Pam| Thatd be great.
Ryan| Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Pam| Oh... is it...
Ryan| Wear something nice.
Pam| No...
Ryan| What?
Pam| Um...
Ryan| I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Pam| Im uh, Im dating Jim.
Ryan| Youre kidding?
Pam| Were together.
Ryan| Thats... great, I... thats awesome.
Pam| Yeah, great.
Ryan|  So let me um, let me look at these.
Pam| OK great!
Ryan| Cool.
Pam| Great.
Jim| I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
Ex-client| Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
Michael| Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
Ex-client| Oh what is this?
Dwight| Its real simple. If you dont appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Ex-client| Maybe you should leave.
Michael| Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, lets leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
Dwight| Can you call us a cab please, Im gonna  Oops, sorry!
Michael| Look, my clothes are so wet!
Dwight| Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!
Ex-client|  Alright here you go, take it back!
Michael| Its been opened.
Ex-client| Yeah it was mine!
Michael| Whats missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Ex-client| Come on guys, get out of here!
Michael| WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Dwight|  Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Ex-client| I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, theyre gone!
Dwight|  Well bill you.
Michael| May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Ryan| That is not correct.
Michael| Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Oscar| You did what?
Michael| I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology, and look where it got me.
Jim| Into a lake.
Michael| Exactly!
Phyllis| Did you get any clients back?
Michael| Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
Michael| Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
Ryan| Im not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldnt be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| I gotcha one.
Jim| Oh wow, thank you.
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| Im just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Pam| No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today, right?
Jim| I guess.  How dare you.
Michael| Hey Toby. Whats this?
Toby| Ohh.
Michael|  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Toby| Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Michael| Oh really.
Toby| ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind its not appropriate to, to do that.
Michael| Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think. I dont think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I dont think its any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Toby| Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Angela|  For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Toby| Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Michael|  No way.
Dwight| What?
Phyllis| You guys are together?
Jim| Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Michael| Woooah! Wow!
Andy| Tuna!
Michael| Awesome!
Kevin| I knew it!
Michael| You guys! Yes! Yes!
Pam| Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Toby| Yes.
Michael| Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Jim| Actually, weve been dating for a couple months.
Michael| I love you guys, so much.
Jim| Ohh..
Pam| Phones ringing.
Michael| No, no, no Pam let em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
Dwight| I dont see it. I think they both could do better.
Angela| Its not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Andy| Jim Halperts off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Michael| Hey. Can you make that straighter? Thats what she said.
Phyllis| Did you plan it?
Michael| No.
Pam|  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Michael| Blowing up balloons I thought.
Pam| You might want to trim it a little.
Phyllis| Michael...
Kelly|  Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Pam| Yeah, he is.
Kelly| Oh.
Michael| Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Angela| What do you want?
Dwight| To give you this .
Angela| Oh, what is that?
Dwight| Its a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and Im giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Angela| Her name was Sprinkles.
Dwight| And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.  Dont you Garbage?
Angela| I cant believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before shes even in the ground.
Dwight| You havent buried her yet?
Angela| Dont rush me. Im grieving.
Dwight| Garbage can be very helpful. OK, hes a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him.
Angela| I dont want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
Pam| Hey Toby.
Toby| Hey...  you two.
Jim| Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those were dating things for the company.
Toby| Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know  relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, theres no need, really.
Jim| Oh.
Pam| Well, I dont wanna speak for Jim, but, its like pretty official.
Toby| Uh huh.
Jim| Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Toby| Lets just wait and see what happens.  You know?
Jim| What?
Toby| Lets just wait.
Jim| Oh, OK.
Pam| OK.
Jim| Great.
Pam|  Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Ryan| Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! Its great to see you. Is Michael in?
Michael| Hey!
Pam| Yeah.
Michael| There he is! There he is! Hes back! And hes with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. Im Tubs.
Ryan| OK. Should we get started?
Michael| Ohh, yeah, lets get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Ryan| Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Michael| ...business meeting --
Kevin|  Fire!
Ryan| Stop that! Stop that!
Michael| Thats right! Thats right!
Ryan|  You scared me.
Michael| Fire guy. Dont start any fires, Ryan.
Andy| Fire guy
Kevin| You werent here for that.
Andy| Here for what?
Kevin| When he started the fire.
Michael| Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. Youre like our little man...
Kevin| Little old man boy.
Ryan| Michael and everybody, umm...
Michael| Beard.
Kevin| Bearded man boy.
Ryan| ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. Id like your respect. I am your boss now. Youre gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Michael| Oh, wow!
Ryan| So...
Michael| Thats a little kinky. I dont swing that way.
Ryan| OK...
Michael| Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Ryan| Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Michael| Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Lets get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
Ryan| Perfect.
Michael| Sounds good. OK, alright.
Michael| Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, were friends. Im doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And well always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
Ryan| Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Jim| Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, Im not really sure whats wrong with it.
Ryan| This is a massive overhaul. Were getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Michael| OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Ryan| Ill stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Dwight| What if we dont want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Ryan| This is company-wide, Dwight.
Dwight| Got it.
Ryan| Andy.
Andy| We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Ryan| Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor.
Kelly| Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Ryan| Thank you everybody.
Michael| Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.
Creed| Thats some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Ryan| As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Creed| Cool beans.
Creed| Were screwed.
Michael| Who is?
Creed| Us? You and me. The old timers.
Michael| I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Creed| Youre over 40, thats the cut off. Are you listening to what hes saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. Im telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, were goners.
Jim| Swore I wouldnt tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Pam| No..
Jim| Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Pam| No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque.
Jim| Wait. What?  You knew? And you didnt say anything?
Pam| You didnt say anything to me?
Jim| Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Pam| Can you believe that...
Phyllis| Sorry, I didnt know you guys were in here.
Jim| Oh no, were just sitting here.
Phyllis| I couldnt see your hands.  Hey Pam, by the way, its great that youre dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You cant base who gets new clients on who youre sleeping with that week, OK?
Pam| OK.
Phyllis| OK.
Jim| OK.
Jim| And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Ryan| OK, whats up?
Michael| Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Ryan| Well it is business, but not as usual.
Michael| Yeah, I know I understand... were making great strides and were updating, but business as usual, no?
Ryan| No.  Were throwing out the entire playbook, were starting from scratch, were implementing a brand new system.
Michael| Good, so, were on the same page?
Ryan| No. Were not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Michael| We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And thats who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
Ryan| So, how are you?
Kelly| Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Ryan| Good.
Kelly| A lot. Black guys mostly.
Ryan| Kelly...
Kelly| What?!
Phyllis| Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Stanley| I dont know.
Phyllis| Did you even try?
Stanley| If the kid wants to set mine up, Ill let him.
Phyllis| I cant see half of the things.
Stanley| Its too little. Use the phone.
Kelly| I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Ryan| Kelly, Im your boss now, OK? You cant keep talking to me like Im your boyfriend.
Kelly| Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I dont think you ever cared about me.
Ryan| I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Kelly| Well, I hope youre still committed because Im pregnant.
Kelly|
Kelly| And guess what buddy,  I am keeping it.
Ryan| OK. OK.
Kelly| Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Ryan| I can... I cant talk about this right now, OK? After work, well go out to dinner, well talk about it then, OK?
Kelly| We have a date!
Dwight| Hello.
Angela| Hello, Dwight. Ive been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Dwight| Really?
Angela| Yes.
Dwight| Ill make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Angela| I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Jan| Hi, Pam.
Pam| Hi.
Jan| Is Michael in?
Pam| In his office. You can go right in.
Jan|  Hey.
Ryan| Jan.
Jan| Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Ryan| So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Jan| Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Ryan| Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Jan| Different salary.  Youll get there, dont worry.
Ryan| Well... you look great.
Jan| Thank you, thank you.
Ryan| Scranton suits you.
Jan| Best decision I ever made.
Ryan| You were let go.
Jan| You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
Michael| Hey.
Jan| Hey.
Michael|  Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
Jan| What?
Michael| I dont want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Jan| So, whats Ryan doing here?
Michael| Oh, I dunno, theyre launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. Hes being a real twerp about it, so, its all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Jan| Hes such a snake.
Michael| Well...
Jan| I hope hes gets hit with an ageism suit.
Michael| What is that... word?
Jan| Ageism? Companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Michael| So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Jan| Yes, Michael, they do.
Oscar| Creed?
Creed| Yes, sir.
Oscar| Everything OK?
Creed| Everythings cool, dude.
Creed| Im thirty. Well, in November Ill be thirty.
Ryan| Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Pam| Michael told us to wait in here. We dont know why.
Ryan|  Ohh... man.
Michael| Good, were all here, we can get started.
Ryan| Michael.
Michael| Have a seat.
Ryan| Were not doing this today.
Michael| Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Ryan| OK. This is...
Michael| Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Toby| Technically, hes right.
Michael| Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Creed| Because theyre lame.
Michael| No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "wheres the Beef?"   Yeah.
Jim| Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Pam| Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
Michael| I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Pam| Oh.
Robert Dunder| Michael Scott?
Michael|  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Whos this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
Dwight| Oh, yeah. Yes!
Robert Dunder| Thank you everyone.
Ryan| Michael,  can I talk to you a second?
Michael| Sure thing.  Scuse me.
Ryan| We have actual work to do.
Michael| Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
Michael| Bob, how old are you?
Robert Dunder| Im 87.
Michael| Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
Robert Dunder| Well, I, I, I havent been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
Michael| Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
Dwight| Im gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
Robert Dunder| I started this company in 1949.
Michael| Wow.
Robert Dunder| Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
Michael| Oh, boy.
Robert Dunder| And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
Michael| Great.
Robert Dunder| And he was, he was  at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
Michael| Great.
Robert Dunder| And...
Michael| Thats great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Robert Dunder| Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
Michael| Perfect.
Robert Dunder| Well, cou, could you get me another...
Michael| Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks, because its illegal, and you will go to jail.
Pam| I think that I should help him get home.
Michael| No, No. Dont help him. He doesnt need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
Michael| Good night guys.
Ryan| Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Michael| I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Ryan| Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Michael| I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ryan| Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go?
Kelly| You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Ryan| Kelly, come on.
Kelly| You know what, youre right. Im feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.
Dwight| Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Angela| Very much. Hows your meat?
Dwight| Dry. Delicious.
Angela| I heard a joke today.
Dwight| Oh, thats funny.
Angela| Yes, it was.
Dwight| Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Angela| I cant do this. I cant be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles stiff lifeless body.
Dwight| Then dont look in my eyes. Look right here , its an old sales trick.
Angela| Im sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Dwight| No, please dont do this, monkey.
Angela| I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
Toby| Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Pam| Hi.
Jim| Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
Pam| Nice to meet you.
Jim|  Nice to meet you.
Toby|  This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
Amy| Yeah, sure. Ill, uh, Ill see you tonight, right?
Toby| Absolutely.
Amy| Whoa.  Easy tiger.
Toby| I just really like you.
Amy| Okay.  Bye guys.  Nice to meet you.
Toby| Have a great day!
Pam| Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  Youre going to violate your own PDA memo.
Toby| I wouldnt want to do that now would I?
Michael| Smell that. Do you smell that?
Dwight| Dry rot?
Michael| No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Andy| Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
Michael| Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. Ill explain, later.
Michael| Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IMs, but I think hes forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
Dwight| Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Angela| Thank you.
Dwight| Youre welcome.
Angela| Is that all?
Dwight| Yes...  I miss you.
Angela| Elevators.
Angela| Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Dwight| Fine.  Then I just want to be friends.
Angela| Good.
Dwight| Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Angela|
Kelly| I dont understand what the big deal is.
Ryan| You dont?
Kelly| No!
Ryan| You lied about being pregnant.
Kelly| Right, so?
Ryan| You really dont understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Kelly| No!
Ryan| Were never getting back together.
Kelly| Why not?
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| Alright I just have to ask now that were public, um, is the magic gone?
Pam| Its funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Jim| I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Pam| I think... I mean, I dont know what it is but...
Jim| Be honest.
Pam| I now find you repulsive.
Jim| Thats honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?
Pam| Eh...
Jim| For me, it was.
Pam| OK.
Jim| Alright.
Michael| Hey boss, I didnt know you were coming in today.
Ryan| Whats, uh, going on here?
Michael| I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
Ryan| With gift baskets.
Michael| With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? Thats what people like.
Michael| Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I cant do things. "You cant be on the team", "You cant move on to second grade". Well, now theyre telling me that I cant win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  Well see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
Michael| OK. Were gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
Stanley| Im not driving with him.
Andy| Ill go with you Stanley.
Stanley| Or him.
Jim| Why dont we just go by ourselves?
Michael| Why dont we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Phyllis| Michael.
Michael| Yes?
Phyllis| This is stupid.
Michael| OK, thats not helpful Phyllis.
Phyllis| How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Michael| Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
Andy| What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... its kind of the best gift ever.
Jim| What about a gift basket full of cash?
Andy| Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Michael| Fine, Im just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
Dwight| Michael, wait. Let me go.
Michael| No, this is my quest.
Dwight| Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please.
Michael| Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Ryan| Good luck Michael.
Michael| We dont need luck.
Dwight| Yeah.
Michael| But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Dwight| Thank you.
Michael| Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
Ryan|  Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand thats confusing.
Creed|  Hey brah, Ive been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guys gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
Dwight|  Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Michael| It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Dwight| Ah, thats a pain in the ass.
Michael| I know. So whos next?
Dwight| Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
GPS| Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
Dwight| Why do you use that thing? Lets them know where you are at all times.
Michael| Who?
Dwight| The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
Ryan| Next night, Im out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure Ill get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night.  I run into Vince Vaughn.
Kevin| No way!
Ryan| Literally.
Andy| Dude, you are so money, but you dont even know it, but you do.
Ryan| ... Later guys.
Kevin| Yeah, later dude.
Andy| Later man.
Kevin| Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
Jim| Yeah, hes definitely something.
Kevin| What does that mean?
Jim| That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Andy| Ha! Tuna...  Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Kevin| Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Andy| He has a killer job, hes rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Kevin| And he can get any girl that he wants.
Andy| So, sorry Tuna but if you dont know why thats awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
Kevin| Tuna. Check you later.
Michael|  Wow, those things are heavy! Theres a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
Larry Myers| You know we closed our account with you right?
Michael| Yes we do.
Larry Myers| Were with Office Depot now.
Dwight| Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Michael| Well...
Dwight| And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Michael| Mmhmm.
Larry Myers| OK. I dont think were coming back.
Dwight| Please, come back.
Michael| OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Dwight| Remember what we had Larry?
Larry Myers| I mean, really its about money.
Michael| Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
Larry Myers| OK thanks.
Michael| Alright.
Larry Myers| I mean their website is really easy to use too. Thats a big deal for us.
Michael|  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Dwight| I dont know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Michael| That is true.
Dwight| Like Angela in accounting.
Michael| Yes, she is nuts.
Dwight| Ugh... no, shes wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
GPS| Make the next right turn.
Michael| How do they know? How does this know where to turn? Thats very impressive.
Ryan| Hey Pam. I havent settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know youre into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Pam| Uh totally.
Ryan| Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and Ill take a look?
Pam| Yeah.
Ryan| Thank you very much.
Pam| Thank you.
Ryan| Cool.
Pam| OK.
Pam| Yeah, Im gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I dont know what Im talking about but Im excited.
Michael| And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
Ex-client| You know I have heard it before.
Michael| Ah, well its still very good. I bet I know someone who hasnt heard that joke... your daughter Emily. Hows she doing?
Ex-client| Shes great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
Michael| Shes gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I dont want to take any more of your time, I know youre a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Ex-client| Oh, OK.
Michael| OK, OK! So youll reconsider?
Ex-client| OK thanks for the goodies.
Michael| Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Ex-client| It looks delicious? I dont know.
Dwight| You dont know?
Michael| Look, we want you back.
Ex-client| Can you offer lower prices?
Michael| Well, no.
Ex-client| Then were not coming back.
Dwight| Hes not coming back, its over Michael.
Michael| No its not.
Ex-client| No hes right.
Dwight| Accept it, why would he come back?
Michael| Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because youre definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Dwight| Thats not gonna change his mind. Hes moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Michael| Look... were also coming out with a website soon. Its a state of the art thing, itll be up and running, its gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
Ex-client| Oh, OK. Well when its up, Ill check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe well come back.
Michael| Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Ex-client| That I dont care about as much. Let me know when the sites up.
Michael| OK, good. Dont let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, shes alergic.
GPS| Proceed straight.
Dwight|  Well were O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Michael| I dont get it, I really dont get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Dwight| Thats how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Michael| That is a very good point, Dwight.
GPS| Make a right turn.
Dwight| Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Michael| No, it said right, it said take a right.
Dwight| No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Michael| Maybe its a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
Dwight| It cant mean that! Theres a lake there!
Michael| The machine knows where it is going!
Dwight| This is the lake!
Michael| The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Dwight| No, its--- theres no road here!
Dwight| Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael!
Michael| Let go, let go of me!
Dwight| I got you, I got you!
Michael|  You sure youre OK?
Dwight| Fine.
Michael| Good, that is whats most important.
Dwight| Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Michael| What a disaster, this whole thing.
Dwight| Ill call a cab.
Michael| These people just dont realize what a gift basket means, they dont get it.
Dwight| Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Michael| What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I dont even know if I want it. Theyre website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Dwight|  Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Michael| Hang up.  You know what were gonna do? Were walking back. Were walking back to that office and were gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Dwight| Yes!
Michael| Were gonna take whats rightfully ours! Were gonna take a stand, Dwight! Were gonna take a stand!
Dwight| Take a stand!
Pam| So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? Id love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
Ryan| I like it a lot. Its clear and subtle at the same time. Its really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Pam| Thanks.
Ryan| Id love to talk to you about it more.
Pam| Thatd be great.
Ryan| Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Pam| Oh... is it...
Ryan| Wear something nice.
Pam| No...
Ryan| What?
Pam| Um...
Ryan| I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Pam| Im uh, Im dating Jim.
Ryan| Youre kidding?
Pam| Were together.
Ryan| Thats... great, I... thats awesome.
Pam| Yeah, great.
Ryan|  So let me um, let me look at these.
Pam| OK great!
Ryan| Cool.
Pam| Great.
Jim| I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
Ex-client| Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
Michael| Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
Ex-client| Oh what is this?
Dwight| Its real simple. If you dont appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Ex-client| Maybe you should leave.
Michael| Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, lets leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
Dwight| Can you call us a cab please, Im gonna  Oops, sorry!
Michael| Look, my clothes are so wet!
Dwight| Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!
Ex-client|  Alright here you go, take it back!
Michael| Its been opened.
Ex-client| Yeah it was mine!
Michael| Whats missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Ex-client| Come on guys, get out of here!
Michael| WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Dwight|  Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Ex-client| I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, theyre gone!
Dwight|  Well bill you.
Michael| May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Ryan| That is not correct.
Michael| Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Oscar| You did what?
Michael| I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology, and look where it got me.
Jim| Into a lake.
Michael| Exactly!
Phyllis| Did you get any clients back?
Michael| Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
Michael| Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
Ryan| Im not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldnt be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Ryan| You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
Jim| I know.  I love it there.
Ryan| No.  You dont know until you live there.  Theres something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Jim| Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Ryan| No. You cant imagine it, though.  The energy when youre actually there.  Youre just part of something bigger than you, thats moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Jim| Sounds great.
Ryan| No.  It... eh... you cant... its not about how it sounds.
Jim| Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
