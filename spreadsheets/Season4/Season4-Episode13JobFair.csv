Michael| Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
Oscar| Yes.
Michael| Yeah, Im pretty excited too.
Michael| Today Im heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
Darryl| Hey, are we doing this thing?
Michael| Yup.
Kelly| Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody Im dating Barack Obama!
Michael| Why are you dressed like that?
Darryl|  Like what?
Michael| Like youre applying for a loan.
Dwight| Maybe hes going to church. Or court.
Darryl| Figured I look presentable.  You?  Went a different way.
Pam|  I think you look nice.
Michael and Darryl|  Thank you.
Michael| Okay, heres what were going to do Im going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We dont have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely aint going to college.
Darryl| What college did you go to Mike?
Michael| Lets go!
Jim| Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that Id like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that Ive never done before. Try.
Phil Maguire|  Whoa!
Jim| Mr. Maguire, its been a couple of years.
Phil Maguire| Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.
Andy| Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding!  Andrew Bernard, Cornell 95.
Phil Maguire| Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, 74
Andy| Oop, got some blisties.
Phil Maguire| Yeah, you do.
Andy| Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender.  Its actually not funny at all. Its incredibly painful.
Phil| Lets make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Jim| Great!
Kevin| What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Kevin| Im gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next months rent.
Pam| So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didnt have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didnt have to play basketball. Those were the days!
Michael|  A little over the top, dont you think?
Darryl| Show them what you brought, Mike.
Pam|  Um, thats all we brought.
Michael| This is all we need.
Oscar| Well see.
Michael| Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!   Hello!
Kevin| Andy, youre up, lets go!
Andy|  Giddy up, lets do this.
Andy| People assume Im great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on.
Andy|  Dammit!
Meredith| Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Phyllis| I mean, Michaels gone, cant we just go?
Creed| Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
Dwight| Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  Excuse me where do you think youre going? Oh no, no, no. Youre not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will -  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Phyllis| What consequences?
Dwight| I will tell on you.
Pam| Theres some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
Justin| Cool.
Pam|  Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Michael| Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Pam| This is Michael, my boss.  Justin.
Michael| Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest."
Pam| Hes nice and he seems interested.
Michael| Hes totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.
Justin| Hi.
Michael| How you doing? Listen, I dont think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
Justin| Sorry for wasting your time.
Michael| Oh, no problem.  And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Darryl| Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Pam| I only brought the one.
Michael| Are you mental?
Pam| Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Dont worry, its just allergies." Do you remember that?
Michael| I... dont.
Pam| Okay. Ill go look for another one.
Michael| And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Jim| Hey, so hows the direct mail business going?
Phil| I cant complain, people love their junk mail.
Jim| Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Phil| You know what Jim? Im not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why dont we just play, okay?
Jim| Absolutely, will do.
Jim| So I guess Ill just... work on my short game.
Michael|  Hello there.
Kid| What is this company?
Michael| Well its funny that you should ask, because its really more than a company...
Oscar| Dunder Mifflin paper.
Kid| Thanks.
Michael| Dammit, Oscar!
Michael| Yeah, Im trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
Dwight| Thank you.
Angela| Extension 128.
Creed|  Hiya Pumpkin, its Creed.
Creed| Say, were gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
Angela| No.
Creed| Are you out?  Pumpkins out, lets go gang!
Pam| My old art room.  Oh, maybe its still here!  No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Michael|  What do you want?
Dwight| Michael, I know youre swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Michael| Who cares? Im not there, Jims not there, why should they have to be there?
Dwight| So... what else is up?  Mich-
Michael| Thank you!  What, what is this?
Pam| A piece of paper.
Michael| This isnt Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Pam| Well I think theyll get the spirit of it.
Michael| Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! Were dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Pam| Are you serious?
Michael| Yes. And dont call me Shirley.
Pam| Okay.
Phil| Oh!  Ah, dammit!
Jim| You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Phil| Yeah Ill- Ill get it out. Thank you.
Jim| Yep.
Angela and Dwight|
Andy|   AH! Come on, Tuna!
Jim| Hey, cant really talk now, whats up?
Pam| Just checking in, hows it going?
Jim| Uh, you know, well see, well see.
Pam| I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Jim| Oh, I like you.
Pam| Talk to you later?
Jim| Yeah. All right. Bye.  All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Phil| You can try. But Ive looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesnt work. Its just- its not in the stars, Jim.  Six.
Kevin| Yeah.
Andy| All right, race to the next hole!
Kevin| Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Andy| Shortcut! Shortcut!   Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Dwight|
Michael| All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
Michael| Hey!  Game over.
Michael|  Just-in time.
Justin| Hi.
Michael| Just-in case. Whats your last name?
Justin| Polznik.
Michael| This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
Michael| Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and shes hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. Hes the most... important thing in my life right now.
Michael| I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
Oscar| Hey.
Justin| Hi.
Michael| This is Darryl Philbin. Isnt he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Pam| Excuse me.
Michael| Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Oscar| Why, why wouldnt you say that to her face?
Michael| So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didnt bring are even better. Justin, Im willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Justin| You didnt want me before. Thats what you said.
Michael| No, I didnt. You misconstrued me.
Justin| You were kind of a jerk to me.
Michael| I, uh, hmm.
Justin| And Im, Im gonna go now.
Michael| Why dont... hey.
Andy|
Dwight|  Ah-choo!
Angela| Bless you.
Dwight| Thank you.
Kevin| Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Phil| Lets open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.
Andy| Count me in!
Phil| No.
Andy| All right!
Jim| Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Phil| Ill tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, lets talk then. Sound good?
Jim| Absolutely.
Maguire| Good playing with you guys.
Andy| Right on.
Jim| You know its a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I dont quit either, and Id call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so Im feeling pretty good.
Woman on mic| The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
Michael| Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, Id like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I dont even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, thats not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, Im gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
Angela|  Thank you.
Dwight| Youre welcome.
Pam|  Beers? You closed it?
Jim| I closed it!
Pam| Yes! Oh!  Um, congratulations to you, sir.
Jim| Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Pam| Well done.
Jim| Thank you. You know what, screw this!
Kevin| Oooh!
Michael| Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
Michael|  Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.
Pam| Hi.
Graphics guy| Hello.
Pam| I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Graphics guy| Are you interested in graphic design?
Pam| Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Graphics guy| Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. Its really basic. Were looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.
Pam| I can do that.
Graphics guy| Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.
Pam| I dont know any of those.
Graphics guy|  Its actually not super-complicated. I mean Im sure theres some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if youre really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, theyve got amazing programs out there for design.
Pam| New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy| Yeah.
Pam| All right. Cool, well... thanks.
Graphics guy| Sure.
Pam| And uh, Ill look into those.
Graphics guy| You should.
Pam| New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy| Absolutely.
Pam| Okay.
Graphics guy| Its where the action is.
Pam| Thanks.
