Pam| Whats wrong Michael?
Michael| I got gum in my hair.
Pam| You do.
Michael| This just stinks. Dont touch it, please dont touch it.
Dwight| Youve got a ton of dandruff.
Michael| OK, let me be.
Jim| Howd you get gum in your hair?
Michael| I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanleys car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
Jim| But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Michael| Kill me... right now.
Pam| We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
Michael| I dont feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Jim| Nope. Not for you its for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Pam| No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Michael| Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair were talking about.
Michael| Smells good.
Dwight| Taste good too.
Michael| Oh dont. Thats disgusting.
Dwight| Wow! Lot of calories.
Michael| Well just dont leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, thats nice.
Dwight| Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Michael|
Michael|  I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women Im getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they arent nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
Oscar| I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Angela| Its ridiculous.
Ryan| Yes, Im having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
Ryan| My favorite branch. Hows everybody doing?
Jim| Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Ryan| Love it. Go.
Jim| Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I dont know that a websites going to be able to replace that.
Ryan| I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Jim| Thanks.
Ryan| David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Jim| Did I? I dont...
Ryan| You did. Yeah.
Jim| Hmm.
Ryan| Watch your back Jim. Im just kidding.
Michael| Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
Ryan| Ok thanks Michael.
Michael| Yeah.
Ryan| Im here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Dwight| Question.
Ryan| Dwight.
Dwight| Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Ryan| This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Stanley| I dont like when my clients call me to help them use the website, Im not seeing commissions on that.
Ryan| I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Stanley| When will that be?
Ryan| TBD. Phyllis?
Phyllis| Did the police solve the problem with the...
Ryan| Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
Ryan| Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Dwight| I dont understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Jim|  Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
Ryan| Its all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? Youre chatting with your friends, youre talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Jim| And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
Creed| I dont get the big fuss here, I like the site.
Kelly| If Id have created a website with as many problems, Id kill myself.
Ryan| Do you have a question Kelly?
Kelly| Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Michael|  Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
Michael| Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Ryan| You too.
Michael| Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
Ryan| Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Michael| Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
Ryan| Na.
Michael| Na?
Ryan| Sorry man.
Michael| Well you tried.
Ryan| But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Michael| Yeah.
Ryan| Unreal.
Michael| They sound great.
Ryan| Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
Michael| Would you have sex with Meredith?
Jim| What?
Michael| Do you think shed keep it quiet?
Jim| Im gonna go to my desk.
Michael| Jim, its not the horniness, ok its the loneliness that...
Jim| I know.
Michael| Lets go to New York. Well go clubbing with Ryan.
Jim| I cant.
Michael| Yes you can, youre single, Im single. Itll be awesome.
Jim| Im not single.
Michael| Who you dating?
Jim| Pam.
Michael| Thats still going on?
Michael| Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, were going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
Dwight| Yeah!
Andy| Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro time. Old ball and chains been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what Im saying.
Angela| Im right here.
Dwight| No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Michael| Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Lets go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
Angela| We get it.
Michael| I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
Dwight|  With sex!
Michael| Thats... I, I think that...
Jim| You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldnt have to come in at all tomorrow.
Jim| So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
Michael| Ryans assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
Michael| Place is packed.
Dwight| Fire hazard.
Michael| Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Dwight| Women look like white slaves.
Michael| No, theyre just hotties.
Ryan| I dont know man, when you think about it, Cabos really the third world. I dont go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Michael| Hey.
Ryan| Michael.
Michael| Hey!
Ryan| What are you doing here?
Michael| Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Ryan| That is so awesome man!
Michael| Alright!
Ryan| And you brought this guy!
Michael| Yeah.
Ryan| Aww!
Michael| Ryan, its Michael and Dwight.
Ryan| I know its you guys.
Michael| Ok.
Ryan| Im so psyched youre here!
Michael| Well.
Ryan| Woooo!
Michael| Alright!
Ryan| Lets get a drink.
Michael| Lets do it!
Jim| Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Kevin| Later.
Jim| Nice job everybody. Great work.
Stanley| Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Jim| Nope. I didnt, but lets go inside and I can call him right now.
Pam| You cant, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Stanley| Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If Im not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, youre both dead.
Pam| There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If Im dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."
Ryan| Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Michael| Hey, nice to meet you.
Troy| Hey, how ya doing?
Dwight| Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Ryan| Ah, he basically is man. Hes a regular banking wizard.
Dwight| No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Ryan| Bottle service yall?
Michael| Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Waitress| We dont serve food here.
Michael| Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Dwight| Do you live in a regular sized house?
Ryan| Yeah. Hes a normal guy, hes cool.
Jim| You really dont have his phone number?
Pam| I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
Toby| I might have it in here.
Pam| Aw! Thats great Toby.
Toby| Its so random that I have it.
Pam| Toby, youre the best.
Toby| When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Jim| Great, Its under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Toby| No.
Jim| Its ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Andy| Yes, its Eddie.
Jim| Its not, its not Eddie, its ah, Evan or...
Creed| Hank, his name is Hank.
Jim| No guys his names not Hank, its ah, is it Edgar?
Phyllis| Elliot.
Oscar| Elliot!
Jim| Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. Youre the guy who sits behind the desk... youre, youre the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean youre. Ah... Who, Whove I got here?
Ryan| Dwight Schrute man. Hows Schrute Farms?
Dwight| Good.
Ryan| This guy owns his own beet farm.
Troy| Insane.
Dwight| Well its weevil season but we were prepared.
Ryan| Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I dont even know what that means. What does that mean?
Dwight| They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Ryan| Crazy. Thats too much for me man, Im gonna hit the bathroom.
Dwight| Youve already been several times.
Ryan| Yeah.
Dwight| Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
Ryan| I dont know, maybe.
Dwight| Ill order you some cranberry juice.
Ryan| With vodka, youre the best.
Dwight|  Do you have powers?
Jim|  Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it.  Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and hes gonna let us all out.  He said it should just be under an hour, so...  we did it.
Oscar| We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Toby| Sorry guys, but I dont think I tipped him for last years.
Angela| Yeah, neither did I.
Phyllis| Jim was supposed to collect it.
Jim| Yup...
Kevin| Way to go, man.
Kelly| Now hes never gonna come.
Andy| By a show of hands, who thinks were a better couple than Jim and Pam?
Pam| Phyllis.
Michael| I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future."  "Back" because its on my back and "Future" because Im the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And its my second favorite movie.
Girl in Club| Ive never heard of that movie.
Michael| Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
Girl in Club| How old are you?

Dwight| Its a lullaby.
Michael| Shh. Ryan, Ryan, were going to take your clothes off.
Ryan| No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Dwight| I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Michael| Shh, just stop. Heres what you do. You tell him that youre his friend and that youre gonna help him and that everyones gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out whos selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people whos really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I dont understand a word of it.
Ryan| Guys, Im going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Dwight| OK. Good night Ryan.
Michael| Best night ever.
Michael| Like I said, its not about the horniness, its about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I dont, I disagree, I say... lets hear it for the boys.
Hank|  Son of a bitch.
