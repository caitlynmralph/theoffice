Michael| Yeah! Everything! Oh its all good, its all good. Phyllis!
Phyllis| Dancing babies!
Michael| Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
Michael| We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... its uh, not too shabby.
Andy| Best ad ever.  Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Jim| Nobody tell him!
Andy| What? No, why?
Jim| You got it, youre so close!
Andy|  Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Jim| Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I dont think...
Andy| Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Jim| Nope.
Andy| Football cream. Grr!
Michael| Okay, its football cream. Its football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
Pam| Im taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Michael| Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
Michael| Hello hello!
Ad guy 1| Hey, how ya doin?
Michael| Michael Scott.
Ad guy 2| Hey, Michael.
Michael| Regional manager.
Ad guy 2| Hey Michael, nice to meet you
Michael| Excited to talk ideas.
Ad guy 1| Lets do it, man.
Michael| You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
Ad guy 1| That sounds great.
Michael| All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
Michael| I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The Nard Dog. Who let the Nard Dog out?
Andy| Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Michael| He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Andy| Its true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got Nard dogged!
Michael| Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Stanley| Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Michael| Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
Michael| These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
Kevin|  Mama Bear!
Michael| Who else?
Jim| I think its great that the companys making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
Jim| You playing that game again?
Dwight| Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesnt have points or scores, it doesnt have winners or losers.
Jim| Oh it has losers.
Dwight| I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
Michael|  Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that shes in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the worlds largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the worlds largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
Ad guy 1| Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
Michael| Actually I dont get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Ad guy 1| That all sounds really, really ambitious.
Michael| Yeah, I know.
Ad guy 1| Why dont we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Michael| Mmm. Okay.
Michael| Thats what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.
Ad guy 1| Thats what we came up with.
Michael| Well we can do better than that.
Ad guy 2| Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.
Ad guy 1| Yeah, its the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
Michael| The waving?
Ad guy 1| Well, no, no. You dont have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
Andy| I need some advice. Ive been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But weve been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. Its just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. Its hot, Im not going to lie to you , but its a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
Dwight| We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
Andy| Well use code names.
Dwight| Angela can stay the same, but well change Andy to Dwight.
Andy| Thats not different enough.
Dwight| Dwike?
Receptionist| You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
Ryan| Hello?
Michael|  Shrek! Shrek, Im a donkey! Im a donkey, Shrek!  Im just kidding. Its me. Hello Ry.
Ryan| What?
Michael| Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
Ryan| I told you not to call about small problems.
Michael| Yeah, well when I call about big problems you dont like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
Ryan| Thats good. Theyre creative, youre not.
Michael| Im creative, Ryan.
Ryan| Its not part of your job, its like, maybe you can cook but it doesnt mean you should start a restaurant.
Michael| Well actually I cant cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mikes Cereal Shack. Im thinking well have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Ryan| Okay, Im not really interested in that right now. Im delegating creativity to creative professionals. Its a different skills set. Look, I wasnt good at sales, right?
Michael| Yeah!
Ryan| But Im good at managing people who do sales .
Michael| Are you? I dont think youre doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
Michael| All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldnt even talk yet.
Michael| Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
Ad guy 2| Okay, when should we come back?
Michael|  How about never hundred hours, sir.
Ad guy 2| We were sent here to help out.
Ad guy 1| Okay Im not going to argue with this guy. Lets go. Good luck dude.
Michael| Hey thanks. Thank you.
David Wallace|  Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Michael| Yeah, Im glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Ryan| Im on Michael.
Michael| Whats up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that its ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and well do it on my dime.
David Wallace| This is weird.
Michael| Im willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
David Wallace| Okay, Ill see it tomorrow.
Michael| Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
Michael| Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "Youre not creative"?
Dwight| Yes.
Michael| Well theyre wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
Jim| Who are you talking to, specifically?
Kevin| I kind of know what its like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.
Oscar| When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Meredith| Im excited about doing the ad, but Im not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
Michael| We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So lets get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, Id like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
Phyllis|  Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. Shes doing a book signing right now.
Michael| Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Phyllis| Okay.
Andy| Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Creed| Shes crazy hot.
Andy| Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say shes Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Angela| Thats not happening.
Angela| I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Phyllis| Bye everyone.
Michael| Line it up Phyllis.
Creed| Get her Phyll.
Darryl|  Out of paper, out of stock, theres friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl| Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
Darryl| Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly| The people persons paper people.
Darryl| Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly| The people persons paper people.
Michael| Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Darryl| Whats rap?
Michael| Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. Ill make you a mix.
Darryl| Great.
Andy| News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Jim| Hey.
Pam| No talk, Im animating.
Jim| Why dont we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you whats going on here.  Okay, this is Dwights Second Life. Hes on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. Its called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Pam| Are you serious?
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| Oh my God, hes really in pain.
Jim|
Pam| Whos that?
Jim| Oh, its just my avatar guy. Whatever.
Pam| He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Jim| Not much, its just for tracking Dwight so---
Pam| Right... youre a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
Jim| Yep.
Pam| You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
Jim| I... why dont we go back to this animation.
Pam| No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Jim| Ah, show me how this works.
Pam| Oh boy.
Darryl|  Out of paper, out of stock, theres friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly| The people persons paper people.
Darryl| Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly| The people persons paper people.
Michael| Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Darryl| Youre right, its better than you! Its us!  Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly| The people persons paper people.
Michael| No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I dont hate it, I just dont like it at all. And its terrible.
Darryl| Youre on your own, Mike.
Michael| Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
Darryl| You just said you hated it.
Michael| No. I said I hate the, the style.
Andy|  Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Michael| Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Andy|  Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Michael| Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we dont get this, if we dont nail it, were going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
Phyllis|  Well, I got in line to buy Sue Graftons book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasnt supposed to take no for an answer.
Michael| Thata girl.
Phyllis| So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Michael| Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
Phyllis|  No.
Michael| Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
Jim| I hope youre not killing yourself on this, because Im sure its good enough for Michaels ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Pam| Maybe, but its not good enough for me yet.
Jim| Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Pam| No no, you can go home. Im good.
Jim| Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So Im pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Meredith| You comin?
Jim| I, ah...
Meredith| Piss or get off the pot!
Pam| Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Jim| Good morning.  Yeah Im sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Pam| Thank you.
Jim| Youre welcome.
Pam| I worked until about 245 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
Andy| Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
Dwight| Andy, I cant hear this right now.
Andy| No, no no no, this is good. You know how we havent really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. Were makin out, Im kissin her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and shes not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and shes like, "Oh D, oh D."
Dwight| She called you D?
Andy| Yeah. D for Andy.
Dwight| Oh D.
Andy| Oh D.
Dwight|  Oh D.
Andy| Oh D!
Both| Ohhhhhh D!  Ohhhh D!
Michael| Im about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. Theyll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
Pam|  Yes?
Michael| Pam, please clear my phone lines.
Pam| Certainly.  Okay, clear.
Michael| They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.
Michael|  Well, its been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
Everyone|  Oh!
Bartender| Hey it seemed like a big hit.
Michael| No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. Its not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
Jim| Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Jim| Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott directors cut. Hope you like it.
Michaels Ad|  It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up.  Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world.  And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time , and bad news isnt always what it seems.  Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance.  To score.  Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world.
Everyone|
Jim| Animation? All her by the way.
Bartender| Really?
Jim| I just thought you should---
Bartender| The animation was cool.
Pam| Thanks.
Bartender| Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?
Jim| Ahh.
Kevin| Michael, that was fun.
Michael| That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
Andy|  Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet.  Its gotta rhyme with "piece." Fancy Feast!  Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! Its the cat food. Nailed it.
