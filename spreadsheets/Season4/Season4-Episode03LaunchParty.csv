Michael| And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  Theyre just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesnt have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
Jim| Theres this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
Pam|  I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didnt see it?  Did Jim say that I didnt see it? I saw it!
Michael|  We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
Andy|  Dah!  Come on!
Michael|  Yeah!  I know.  I know.  Its bland.
Oscar|  Its never gonna happen.
Kevin|  Dude, you gotta believe.
Michael| Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Jim|   Wait for it.
Michael| Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a "Wheres Waldo."
Everyone|  Oh! Yes!
Michael|  Alright. Alright.  Lets quit while were ahead.
Kevin|  That was so awesome.
Michael|  That was awesome. Thank you.
Michael|  Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
Meredith|  Hey... there he is.
Jim| Hey Meredith, how you feelin?
Meredith|  I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Jim| Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Meredith|  Well, I really appreciate you coming. Im singling you ouuuut.
Jim| Haha...
Meredith|  Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
Jim| Uh-huh.
Meredith|  And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
Jim|  MmmHmm...
Meredith|  Can you write where I can read it?
Jim|  Oh yeah.
Meredith|  Ill read this when I get home.
Jim|  Alright...
Pam|  Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Michael|  Oh, does he?
Pam| He does.
Michael|  Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
Jim|  Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Michael|  And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Michael|  Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York Citys finest, and I do not mean policemen...
Michael|  The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 600 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
Dwight|  Thats ridiculous.  Im not going to be beaten by a website.
Jim|  Actually it sounds like you are.
Dwight|  Really?  Cause Ryan says so?
Kelly| If thats from Ryan, does it mention if hes seeing anybody?
Michael|  No.  It doesnt.  Ill find out tonight.
Stanley|  Yes, please let us know.
Dwight|  I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Angela|  Waste of time.
Michael|  Whats that, pipsqueak?
Angela|  Waste of time.  The websites going to win.
Dwight|  You believe a computer can beat me?
Angela|  I dont care, but yes.
Dwight|  Well I will prove you wrong.
Angela|  I dont care, and you wont.
Dwight|  Well see.
Angela|  I wont be watching, and I wont.
Pam|  Dwight mercy killed Angelas cat.  Its very complicated.  Its caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Phyllis|  Stanley, youre dancing!
Stanley|  No Im not.
Ryan|  Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I dont want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Voice of Thomas Dean|  I told you I dont want you doing these things in here.  You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
Ryan|  Convergence.  Viral marketing.  Were going guerrilla.  Were takin it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I dont want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin paper just became fun.
Andy|  And this is where I will record your sales.
Dwight|  Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Andy|  And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Jim| Or zipadeedoodaah.
Andy|  I cant tell if hes mocking me.
Dwight|  Just ignore him.
Andy|  Ehh, cant do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
Jim|  I was... mocking.
Andy|  Thank you.
Dwight|  I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Andy| Yes like a chime or a bell...
Jim|  Or a gong.
Dwight|  Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Andy|  Yes!
Kevin|  Isnt 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Angela|  Lunch party?  Its supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Phyllis|  Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this.  So were gonna try out some new things today.
Phyllis|  So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Angela|  I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Phyllis|  Im so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Angela|  It is awful.  Youve made this day awful!
Kevin|  Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Angela|  Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Michael| Ohh, lunch party.
Angela|  Its supposed to say launch!
Michael| Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Angela|  I care!
Angela|  Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And heres $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots wholl do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cats still dead.
Andy|  Twenty seconds to go time.
Dwight|  Got it.  Carb up.
Jim|  Really?  Power gel?
Dwight| Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
sAndy|  Okay.  We start.  As soon as I make... this shot.  Aaannnddd go!
Dwight| Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
Jim| What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Dwight|  Today Im prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Jim|  What?
Pam|  Hes going through a break-up.
Jim|  Yeah, Im aware of that.  But hes also being super annoying.  And Im not a perfect person.
Andy|  Yeah!
Dwight|  Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Pam|  What kind of prank are you thinking?
Dwight|  What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  Ill hold.
DunMiff/sys|  Who am I?
DwightKSchrute|  You tell me.
Jim|  Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
DunMiff/sys|  Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
DwightKSchrute|  How do I know this isnt Jim?
DunMiff/sys|  What is a Jim?
Dwight|  It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Michael|  Okay.
Pam|  Yes its too tight.
Kelly|  Waaay too tight.
Michael|  Really?
Oscar|  This is why Im here?
Kelly|  Why is it so tight?
Michael| Its the European cut.
Angela|  Is just looks bad.
Michael|  Umm... hey.  Ah, whats hanging?
Tech Guy|  Setting up the web-cam for the party.
Michael|  Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Kelly|  Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Michael|  I had um, one of those danishes.
Pam|  Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Kelly|  You had carbs?  Thats awful.
Pam|  Uh, just one second.  Were in a meeting and Ill see if hes available.  Its Jan.
Michael|  Why dont you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  Itll be fun.
Jan|   My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Michael|  Just...
Jan|  Is it really that important to you?
Michael|  Yeah.
Jan|  Alright.
Michael|  Thank you.
Jan|  Go by yourself.
Michael|  Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think Im a big loser.
Jan|  Well...
Michael|  Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
Jan|  What? No Michael!
Michael|  Im sorry. Im sorry.  Its just the first... girl that popped into my head.  Ill find somebody I havent slept with.
Dwight| Ohhhhhh!
Andy|  Website check please.
Meredith|  Three hundred and five.
Andy|  Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
Meredith|  Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
Andy|  You my friend are in a very close second.
Meredith|  Four-oh-two.
Andy| Okay, uh why dont you just lay off, lady?
Meredith|  What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Michael|  So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Jim|  Sure well go.
Michael|  Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Jim|  Oh Im sorry.  What?
Pam|  One of the tickets is for him.
Michael|  Just let me know who the winner is.
Pam and Jim|  Not it.
Jim|  Nope.
Pam|  I won.
Jim|  Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Pam|  Tie goes to the girlfriend.
Dwight|  No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what Im suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  Thats exactly what youre not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh.
Jim|   Hows it going?
Dwight|  Fine.  Good.
Jim|  Yeah?
Dwight|  Yeah.
Jim|  You look a little worried.
Dwight|  I do not look worried.
DunMiff/sys|  You do look worried.
DwightKSchrute|  Heres a suggestion computer.  I assume you read...
Pam|  Heres a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why dont you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Jim|  Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Angela|  I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Phyllis|  I want to understand what youre saying but its difficult for me when you use that tone.
Angela|  Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Phyllis|  Yes.
Angela|  Goodie.
Jim|  Hey man.
Darryl|  Whats up man?
Jim|  Whats going on?
Darryl|  Make a delivery.
Jim|  Oh yeah?
Darryl|  Kelly ordered this online.
Dwight|  What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Kelly|  But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."
Dwight|  Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
Darryl|  Who knows?
Dwight|  Return it!  Return it now!
Darryl| Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin multiple reams like a man.
Dwight|  Y... You dont understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, Im gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Darryl|  Whos it?
Darryl|  Here you go.
Kelly|  Thanks.
Darryl|  So you still missing Ryan?
Kelly|  Not so much anymore.
Darryl|  Mmmmm.
Dwight|  I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Dwight|  Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than youre paying right now?  Its not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Michael|  Alright.  Im ready to go and Im callin shotgun.
Jim|  Im driving?
Michael|  Yes.  Thank you.
Jim|  Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Michael|  Oh yeah, youd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I love ya Pam... okay.    Im leavin inside Jims car, I dont know when Ill be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow Ill be back.  Ill be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why dont you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
Angela|  Because theres a party! A party for the website Ive been planning for two weeks.
Michael|  If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Dwight|  Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
DunMiff/sys|  Oh.  I didnt realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
Dwight|  Im sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Dwight|  Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered womens shelter?
Andy|  No !
Dwight|  Huh?!
Angela|  Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
Dwight|  Did you see the board?
Angela|  Theres still an hour.
Michael|  You ever read this?
Jim|  Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Michael|  Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places Youll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
Jim|  Yeah.
Michael|  Same sort of stuff in here.
Jim|  Its not.  Its different.  But its a good book.
Michael|  Mmwa.  Mmwa.
Jim|  What was that?
Michael|  Leaving Pennsylvania.
Jim|  Oh.  Two kisses.
Michael|  One for me one for Jan.
Jim|  Gotcha.
Michael|  You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  Thatd be fun.  Friday?
Jim|  That would be fun.
Michael|  Wanna come over Friday?
Jim|  Uhhh.  Cant.
Michael|  After work you guys...
Jim|  Oh, no cause... youre gonna let me know when were close, right?
Michael|  Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  Its a club called Chatroom, and theres a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
Jim|  Mmmkay...
Michael|  What are you doing?
Jim| Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Michael|  No.
Jim|  Yep.
Michael|  No, Im sure thats not.  Na...
Jim|  Are there, uh, three ws at the beginning of the address?
Michael|  Yes.
Jim|  Yep.
Michael|  Well the invitation says VIPs only.  Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?  Were already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay Im going to throw up.  Im throwing up.  Youre making me throw up, Ryan.
Michael|  You know what this is like?  Ill tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldnt let any of the Seniors go.
Michael|  Doesnt it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Jim| Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Michael|  Yeah.  I withdrew too.
Andy|  Four!  Three!  Two!  One!
Dwight|  Yes!
Andy|  Woo!
Dwight|  Woo!
Andy|  After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in its path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
Dwight|  Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Andy|  Fifty-two reams!
Dwight|  No no no the first part.
Andy|  Dwight has defeated the computer.
Dwight|  Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Angela|  I didnt ask you to do it for me.
Dwight|  You didnt have to.
Angela|  How do you tell someone its over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Angela|  Hello, Pam.
Pam|  Hello.
Angela|  Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Pam|  Um... uh... Ill get back to you.
Angela|  Let me know.
DunMiff/sys|  You beat me.  You are the superior being.
Michael|  Alright who wants to party?
Oscar|  Why arent you in New York?
Michael|  Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
Stanley|  You said you werent coming back and we could leave early.
Michael|  I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Angela|  Thank you.
Michael|  Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party youve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybodys gonna come.  Whats wrong with Dwight?
Andy|  He beat the computer.
Michael|  Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela Id like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
Michael|  This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasnt as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, Im not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
Michael|  How we doing on time?
Angela|  The party starts in an hour.
Michael|  Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Angela|  Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Michael|  Mmmhmm.
Angela|  Something made of ice?
Michael|  Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Angela|  Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Michael|  I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
Angela|  Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Michael|  Yes
Angela|  Cool music.
Michael|  Uh...
Angela|  Confetti.
Michael|  I want it...
Angela|  Go-Go dancers?
Michael|  I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
Angela|  I cant do this.
Michael|  Yes you can.
Angela|  I cant do it.
Michael|  Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldnt say that if I didnt hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Angels|  Okay.  Okay.
Michael|  No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we dont have a lot of time.  Ill get the pizza!
Andy| What do you think of Angela?
Dwight| I think shes efficient.
Andy| No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
Dwight| I hadnt noticed.
Andy| You hadnt noticed shes a woman?
Dwight|
Andy| I hear shes single and ready to mingle.  Im thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
Dwight| I think its inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Andy| Isnt that part of the fun?
Dwight| No.  I think you should date Kelly.
Andy| She works here too, how is that any different?
Dwight| Uh, she works in the annex.  Youre also welcome to date Toby.
Andy|  Okay.
Michael| Good news.
Stanley| We get to go home?
Michael| Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
All|
Kevin| Wait! Alfredos Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Michael| Same thing.
Kevin| No, no.
All|
Michael| You know what?  I dont understand when you all talk at the same time.
Kevin| Oscar, talk to him.
Oscar| Michael, theres a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Michael| Pizza by Alfredo.
All|
Michael| Okay, okay, whats better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
All| Medium amount of good pizza.
Michael|
Kevin| Oh no, its bad.  Its real bad.  Its like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Phyllis| You can pick one of these things.  Its unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
Angela| It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Phyllis|
Angela| Ow!
Phyllis| That seemed to shut her up.
Andy| Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because youre not going to find it in that box.
Andy| Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Andy| Angela, are you hearing words that Im saying?
Angela| What?
Andy| Hello.
Angela| I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now Ive got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now theres no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing thats made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and its itched all day, and I cant reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
Andy| They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Michael| Yup.
Pam| The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
Michael| You dont have to say it like that.
Pam| I said it normal.
Michael| Hey
Pizza guy| Hey.  Sixty-three fifty, and thats not including tip.
Michael| Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Pizza guy| The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
Michael| Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
Pizza guy| I dont care what you told them on the phone, thats our policy.
Michael| You didnt actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Oscar| Its not pizza.
Michael| Okay, it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon, and if its policy, it should say it on the coupon.
Pizza guy|
Michael|  What do you mean hmm-um?
Pizza guy| Not my problem.
Michael| It is your problem.  Thats no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Pizza guy| Great story.  Its sixty-three fifty, and thats not including tip.
Michael| Im not giving that to you.
Pizza guy| Well then youre not getting youre pizzas.
Michael|  No, no youre not going anywhere.  Youre staying here until we figure this out.
Pizza guy| What?
Michael| You know what?  This young man needs to learn thats not how you treat people.  I dont care if its pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You dont just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
Pizza guy| Im not going in there.
Michael| Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
Pizza guy| This is stupid.
Michael| No, you dont even know what stupid is.  Its about to get all stupid up in here.
Stanley| You find anything?
Kevin| We think its a straight forward kidnapping.
Oscar| Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"?
Stanley| Why cant you guys do it?
Oscar| Because were looking up jail time.
Stanley| Fine.
Dwight| Ive seen this kid before. Hes one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Pizza guy| Yeah, I know that guy.  Hes that farmer that grows really crappy weed.
Michael| You ready to give me my discount now?
Pizza guy| No.
Michael| Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Pizza guy| What kind of business is this?
Dwight| Were a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Michael| Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
Pizza guy| You better think about what youre doing.
Michael| No!  Im an adult, I dont have to think or do anything.  Youre a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks hes better than everyone else, because hes some hot shot, and you dont know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Pizza guy| Sales?
Michael| Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked thats called sales.
Pizza guy| Youre such a loser.
Dwight| What did you just call him?
Pizza guy| A loser.
Dwight| What did you say?
Pizza guy| A loser.
Michael| Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Dwight| I can make him talk, Michael.
All| Michael, Michael
Michael| Stop talking all at once!
Jim| You need to let him go.
Michael| Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Jim| Yes.
Michael| You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Jim| Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Michael| Im not kidnapping him, Im keeping him until I get what I want.
Jim| As a hostage.
Michael| I think youre over-thinking it.
Jim| I think youre under-thinking it.
Michael| Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that Im keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Jim| Ransom.
Michael| Trouble.  Okay, alright.
Jim| What did he say?
Michael| He said no.
Jim| So, we should let him go.
Michael| No, no.
Jim| Okay.
Dwight| Listen up kid.    I dont like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Angela| I have to hang these.
Pizza guy| Why are you looking at her like that?
Dwight| Hey!
Kevin| Whats going on?
Jim| Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Michael| Mister Overdramatic, whats up Kevin?
Kevin| Were getting hungry out there.  Were all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredos Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Angela| I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
Meredith| I think it looks good.
Angela| Thats why youre not in charge Meredith.
Andy| Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
Angela| How did you, um, where did you...
Dwight| Its just ice, itll melt all over the floor.
Angela| Will you help me put it over there?
Andy| Yes I will.
Angela| Okay.
Andy| Excuse me.
Andy| I stole it!
Oscar| Thank God.
Pam| Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Michael| Ill just wave and introduce myself.
Jim| Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Pam| Im all over it.
Jim| Okay.
Jim| What have we got here?
Kevin| Good pizza.
Jim| Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Kevin| Different stuff.
Jim| Which ones this? Perfect.
Jim| Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Pam| Yeah, enjoy this moment, because youre never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
Jim| And thats when I knew. You?
Pam| You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and theres no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt youre about to eat has expired.
Jim| That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Pam| Yep.
Jim| Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Pam| Nope.
Manager| Can I start talking?  Is this thing on?  Give me a signal when you want me to start.
Ryan| And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Michael| Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
Ryan| Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Pizza guy| If anyone out there is listening, Im being held here against my will.  Im a minor.
Angela| Ow! What are you doing?
Andy| You said your upper back itched.
Angela| I didnt ask you to scratch it.
Andy| Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now Ive repulsed you, but I like you.
Angela| Im not dating you.
Andy| So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, shes giving off fairly strong vibes that shes not interested.
Dwight|
Andy| But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I cant back down.
Dwight|  If youre going number one youve got ten more seconds!
Michael| Hey, have you seen Jim?
Kevin| I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Dwight| Ahh-chaa!
Michael| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Dwight| Im just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think youre going to do something to him.
Pizza guy| I can hear you, man.
Dwight| Shut up, or Im going to punch you in the throat!
Michael| Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Dwight| You had to, what other choice did you have?
Michael| I could have paid for the pizza.
Dwight| Well, yeah.
Michael| Oh my God, oh my God.
Michael| This is Michael.
Ryan| Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Michael| Youre breaking up. I cant hear you.
Ryan| Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that hes being held against his...
Michael|  Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
Dwight| What will you do?
Michael| I will open the door.
Dwight| Yeah.
Michael| And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Dwight| So, Im paying full price?
Michael| Yes.
Dwight| Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  Theres two more.
Michael| See ya, drive safely.
Michael|  Okay.
Dwight| Now what?
Michael| Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
Dwight| Alright.  Oh, I assume Im going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Michael| Not now Dwight, please, its not the time.
Jim| A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Pam| Ah-ha.
Andy|  Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
Andy|  If you change your mind, Ill be first in line.  Honey, Im still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if youre feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey Im still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that aint no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, thats all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
Voice 1 on phone| Hey howd it go?
Voice 2 on phone| Yeah, whatd she say?
Andy| I dont know yet, I have to call you back.
Voice 1 on phone| You have to give us something...
Andy| Ill call you back.
Angela| I have to go clean up after the party.
Michael| What a horrible day.
Dwight| Blah.
Michael| Bluh.
Dwight| Uhh.
Michael| Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  Id really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
Dwight| What?
Michael| Im going to get it.
Dwight| Coopers has calamari.
Michael| Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
Dwight| Tokyo?
Michael| New York.  Wanna go?
Dwight| Yes.
Michael| Alright, you drive.
Dwight| Okay.
Dwight| Nice.
Michael| Here we go.
Dwight| Woo-hoo.
Michael| Mmm.
Dwight| Yum.
Bartender| Im sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.
Michael| Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, lets go.
Man| Hey, youre the Scranton guy.
Michael| Guilty.
Man| I liked your statement tonight.
Michael| Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
Man| Oh, very cool.  It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
Michael| Yeah.
Man| See you later.
Dwight| Later on.
Michael|  Im Ryan, and tonight didnt go the way that I thought it would, because it didnt work out for me, and Im very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
Dwight|  And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Michael| I never sold any paper, because Im an idiot.
Dwight| I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Michael| I made it with my cheese pita.
Dwight| I date Indian girls.
Michael| I started a fire, I started a fire.
Dwight| Now Ive got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and Im your boss.
Michael| And Im hot, Im so hot. Thats why everybody...
Dwight| I dont get that, I dont understand that.
Michael| Well, its part of it, its just the... uhhh.
Michael| Wanna head back?
Dwight| Yeah, lets go.
Ryan|
