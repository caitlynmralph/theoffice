Stanley| This is ridiculous.
Phyllis| Do you have any idea what time well get out of here?
Michael| Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
Jim| Nope I dont, remember when you told us not to make plans cause were working.
Michael| Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, Im - God, Im so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we dont want to work. No we dont! Its not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! Were not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Dwight| Thank you Michael.
Michael| All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
Jim| I think you did.
Michael| I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
Jim| Oh, I-
Michael| You said you didnt have plans. Thats what you said.
Jim| Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time weve been able to get out of it. But Ive got to give him credit, he got me. Because Im starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Dwight| Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Michael| Dwight, its couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Andy| Hey-o!
Dwight| Does it bother me that I wasnt invited to Michaels dinner party?
Jan| Hi.
Michael| Hello.
Jim| Hi.
Jan| How are you?
Michael| Come on in. Good to see you.
Jan| Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Michael| Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Jim| Lets see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Michael| Yeah.
Jim| I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Michael| Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
Jim| Really?
Michael| Except driving.
Pam| We got you this.
Jan| Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Michael| Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I dont know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Pam| Its really nice.
Jan| So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Jim| Tour, lets do the tour first.
Michael| Okay.
Jan| Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Michael| Totally your call babe.
Jan| Alright, well, lets go then, I say upstairs.
Jim| Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Michael| Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
Jan| Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, were still a work in progress here.
Michael| Well, thats...
Jan| This is my office.
Michael| Yep, never been used.
Jan| Not super exciting.
Michael| No.
Jan| And this is my workspace.
Michael| This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
Pam| Uh-huh.
Michael| As you can smell theres a lot of different odors going on in here.
Pam| So you have an office and a workspace?
Jan| I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, Im sure that youre the same with your doodles.  Smell.
Jim| Its fire.
Jan| Uh-huh, Bonfire.
Michael| Bond.
Jan| Men love this one.
Michael| James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
Jan| When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Jim| Just like that.
Jan| Just like that.
Jan| So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Michael| Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
Jan|  Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Michael| Well, I-
Jan| Shame on you.
Pam| What a cute bench.
Michael| Thanks, thats my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Jim| Really? cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Michael| Its actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
Jan| See, he fits perfectly.
Michael| I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.
Jim| Wow.
Michael| Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
Jim| What is that chestnut?
Michael| No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Jan| Its pine.
Jim| Michael, Im just terrible at all this stuff, so thats really cool.
Jan| Really?
Pam| Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didnt have audio for a week.
Michael| If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Jan| I bet you are.
Jim| Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. Im surprised theyre not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Jan| It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies."
Michael| Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
Jan|  Oh, excuse us just a second.
Michael| Ill get it.
Jan|  So glad youre finally able to be here.
Angela|  No, no.
Michael| Okay.
Andy| Tuna! Whats up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner?  I bet youre sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna!  These are for you.
Jan| Oh, how thoughtful.
Michael| Very nice.
Andy| Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Jan| Aw.
Angela| What am I supposed to do with this?
Jan| How bout we do the short tour and then Ill start dinner?
Pam| Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Jan| Oh no no no, its just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Pam| Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 400?
Jan| You know Pam, in Spain they often dont start eating until midnight.
Michael| When in Rome.
Jan| Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
Michael| Whatever you say babe.
Jan| Follow me.
Michael| All right.
Michael| How bout a toast. Shall I? Heres to good friends.
All| Cheers.
Michael| Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Jim| What was that?
Jan| So music, should we turn some music?
Michael| Yeah that sounds good.
Jan| Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Hunters CD| You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
Michael| You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Jan| Well I think hes probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Angela| Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Pam|  I dont care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
Andy|  No its a... hump. Theres a hump.
Jan| Joe Camel!
Andy| Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Pam| Montana.
Jan| Oh!
Pam| Joe Montana!
Andy| Yes! Yes.
Pam| Why didnt you just say 49ers quarterback?
Michael| All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Jan| Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Michae| What, no, Im just making people laugh.
Jan| No.
Michael| Yes, I was watching Jims face.
Jan| I was watching Jim.
Michael| And he was laughing.
Jan| No smiling.
Michael| Look at him, hes laughing.
Jim| Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and its called Lets see how uncomfortable we can make our guests and theyre both winning. So Im going to make a run for it.
Jim| Youll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Pam| Oh okay.
Michael| Well you dont need two of you to do that.
Jim| Thats true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam Ill see you at home, thank you so much.
Pam| Oh Jim, I dont think youre going to abandon this party here all by itself.
Jim| I dont know because I everything I own is there.
Pam| You can buy new stuff but you cant buy a new party.
Michael| Thats true, thats a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
Andy| Michael, youre up.
Michael| All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
Jan| No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Michael| All right, Okay, okay, youre getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
Angela| I dont know.
Jim| Katie Holmes.
Michael| No, Baah! But hes married to her!
Jim| Oh, Dawsons Creek.
Michael| No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, Im gonna pass, Im gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
Jan| No rhyming!
Jim| Not really a rhyme.
Angela| Another clue, another clue.
Michael| Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
Angela| Those arent helpful.
Jim| Tom Cruise!
Michael| No!
Andy| Time!
Michael| God, does anybody read the paper?!
Pam|  Oh, thank you.
Michael| Youre welcome.
Jan|  Im so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. Its actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Michael| I dont like that story babe.
Jan| Come on, its a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Michael| Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, dont. I shouldnt say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
Jan| You are so right, youre so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Michael| Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! Im in hell! Aaahhh Im burning, help me!
Angela| You shouldnt joke about that.
Pam| Is there more wine in the kitchen?
Jan| I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didnt get. Its okay, I dont mind. In fact you know what, girls trip, Angela come on. Girls trip.
Jan|  Uh, not even close.
Angela| So you keep a very tidy house.
Jan| You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I dont have to tell you Pam.
Pam| No, yeah. What?
Jan| Oh well dont tell me that hes really changed since you guys dated.
Pam| Oh, are you joking?
Jan| Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Pam| I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
Angela| Ive noticed how you look at him at the office.
Jan| Mmhmm.
Michael|  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jans candles.
Jim| Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Michael| Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
Andy| Thought about it, Im in.
Jim| Im sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jans company?
Michael| Im sorry.  What now?
Jan| Coming!
Dwight| Hello.
Jan| What are you doing here?
Dwight| We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Pam|  Awesome.
Jan| What is he doing here?
Angela| Yes, What are you doing here?
Michael| Dwight is my friend.
Woman| We werent invited?
Michael| You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didnt have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Jan| Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Michael| Whatever I want? Its never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
Jan| We saw Wicked.
Michael| When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasnt so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didnt want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
Jan| I am so sorry that I dont want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Lets have a ing kid.
Michael| Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
Jan| I hate my life.
Dwight| So can we come in?
Dwight| Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Jan|  Im just gonna check on dinner.
Dwight| Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Angela| I hate beet salad.
Woman| Its actually really good.
Dwight| Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. Ive seen you eat it many times.
Angela| The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Michael|  Pam... I hope she didnt do anything to the food.
Pam|  Like... like what?
Michael| I cant prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
Andy| Yeah it does.
Pam| I know Jan didnt poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldnt it be me? Michaels former lover?
Jan|  Can you not do that? Its disgusting.
Michael| You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Jan| Oops.
Michael| Excuse me for a second.
Jim|  So... how do you guys know each other?
Woman| I was his babysitter.
Pam| And now you guys are dating?
Dwight| Purely carnal and thats all you need to know.
Jim| Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Woman| E-mail?
Jim| Nevermind.
Michael| Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
Jim| Thats nice.
Michael| Everybody enjoying their meal?
Jan| Hey babe?
Michael| Yeah?
Jan| How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Michael| No. No. Im gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Jan| Ok.
Michael|  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I dont think hes that good.
Jan| At least hes an artist.
Michael| BFD. Im a screenwriter.
Jan|  AND IM A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DONT HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael| NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Jan| FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Michael| MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Jan| YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Michael| OH GOOD. ILL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
Jan|  AND YOURE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Michael|  THATS WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
Woman| Im gonna get going.
Dwight| Fine. Get outta here.
Jim| Its getting late.
Michael| You know what guys, shell be out of the bathroom soon.
Jim|  Of course
Dwight| Get out of my way, Ill take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Officer 1| Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
Michael| Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Officer 2| The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Michael| Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Officer 1| You wanna press charges?
Michael| Would she get into trouble?
Officer| Yes.  Shed be charged.
Michael| I will take the fall. I did it.
Officer 2| You know you dont have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
Jan|  Michael!  Michael. What are you doing to him?
Officer 1| Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?
Dwight|  Michael can come home with me.
Michael| Jim? Pam?
Jim| Oh... my apartments on fire
Pam|  Flooded.
Jim| Flooded.
Dwight| You people.  Come on. Youre sleeping with me.
Michael| No.
Dwight| Im gonna take you home Michael.
Michael| Nope.
Dwight| Alright.
Jan| Bye Babe!
Pam|  This is the best burger Ive ever had, babe.
Jim| You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Pam| Hmm?
Jim|  I stole this.  For you babe.
Pam|  One night...
