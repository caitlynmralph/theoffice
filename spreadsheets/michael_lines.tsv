 All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
 So youve come to the master for guidance? Is this what youre saying, grasshopper?
 All right. Well, let me show you how its done.
  Yes, Id like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. Youre a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, Im sorry. OK. Im sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So thats the way its done.
 Ive, uh, Ive been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
 If you think shes cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
 Any messages?
 Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? Theres a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
 Its called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
 People say I am the best boss. They go, "God weve never worked in a place like this before. Youre hilarious." "And you get the best out of us."  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
 Whassup!
 Whassup!
 Whass...up!
  What?
 OK. All right. See you later.
 Back to work.
 Corporate really doesnt really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because Im scared of her. Because Im not. But, um... Yeah.
 Um... Me no get an agenda.
 I didnt get any agenda.
 Really? I didnt...  Did we get a fax this morning?
 Why isnt it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So whats the problem, Pam? Why didnt I get it?
 Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brothers, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesnt work great with faxes.
 Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
 OK...
 No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
 All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
 OK. No problem.
 Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldnt wish that on Joshs men. I certainly wouldnt wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
  Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
 Oh, thats not appropriate.
 Uh, I dont know what you mean.
 Oh, my God! Oh! Thats... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
 No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.
 Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I dont see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
 Hey.
 Guilty! Guilty as charged!
 Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
 Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. Its a guy thing, Pam. Im sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  Im Hitler. Adolf Hitler.
 Relax. Everythings under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Thats important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
 Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, dont you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
 Im sorry?
  If youre unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
 I think Im a role model here. I think I garner peoples respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
 People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that its really beyond words. Its really incalculable.
 Now I know theres some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
 Assistant to the Regional Manager.
 Im about to tell everybody. Im just about to tell everybody.
 You dont know what it is.
 I dont need your permission.
 Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
 Not gonna happen.
 It wont be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
 No.
  Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, Im a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
 I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
 Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
 No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then theyre gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Joshs people, but Im the head of this family, and you aint gonna be messing with my chillin.
 Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
 Introduce yourself. Be polite.
 Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
 Thats his profit.
 OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
 What is that?
 No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
 Discipline. Kinky!  All right, heres the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
  And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwights personal effects into Jell-O.
  Nice. Thats the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
 Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
 Pudding. Pudding... Im trying to think of another dessert to do.
 So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that Ive created here is that Im a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punkd and all that kind of stuff?
 You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
 Just follow my lead. Dont pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I dont want to...
 Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
 Why? Well, theft and stealing.
 Post-it Notes.
 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  youve made a profit... margin. Youre gonna run us out of business, Pam.
 Yeah. I am.
 But the best thing about it is that were not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. Im sorry.
  You been Xd punk!  Surprise! Its a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
  I dont know about that.
 What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. Its the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didnt work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
 Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
 Gotcha. Good. Id go with the rows. Thats a good idea.
 Today is diversity day and someones going to come in and talk to us about diversity. Its something that Ive been pushing, that Ive been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think its very important that we have this. Im very, very excited.
 Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
 Did you have a good weekend going there?
 Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
  Right. See? I dont even know, first-name basis!
 Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, lets do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
 Its diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
 Come on people, lets get em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
 You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I dont look at you as another race.
 Exactly, were not...
 With tolerance.
 Ignorance.
 Lets celebrate.
 Celebrate good times. Come on! Lets celebrate diversity. Right?
 You know what? Heres what were going to do. Why dont we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
 Yes.
 OK.
 Hey, hey why dont you run it by me and Ill run it by him.
 OK. Why dont we just defer to Mr...
 Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
 How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because Im white and Chris is black?
 I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
 OK, I will play guy listening.
 OK.
 Kevin is a great guy. Hes a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
 OK. Im sorry. Im sorry. Hes ruin... Hes butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!
  They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
  What you want a cookie?
  I dont think I can sign this.
 Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
 Sure.
 Heres the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and its probably more advanced than youre used to. Thats probably throwing you off a little bit.
 OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
 OK.
 Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you dont.
  I wont.
 Yeah, yeah.
 "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."  Hes going to lose it when he reads that.
 "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I dont. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didnt see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, Im going to have you all in tears.
 All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. Its time. Lets do some good.
 Get out.
 No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, lets go. Lets do it. Come on. Lets have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as Ive always said. But dont take my word for it. Lets take a look at the tape.
  Hi. Im Michael Scott. Im in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but Im also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If youre a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
 OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
 Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but Im going to add on to it later on.
 Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
 Yeah, well, if you leave well only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, lets get down to business and why dont I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
 Two fifteenths.
 Well, you know what, its kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Lets get this popping. Come on. Whos going? Whos going? Lets go here. Oscar, right here. Youre on.
 Oh, yeah...
 Wow.
 Wow. That is... That is a great story. Thats the American Dream right there, right?
 Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
 Well, it has certain connotations.
 Like... I dont... I dont know.
 No. Now, remember that honesty...
 ...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!
 I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Dont look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isnt just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get er done.
 Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. Theres this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. Im not going to do it but its...
 Oh this is a good one.
 Push it.
 Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
 No, that was inadvertent. We didnt actually plan that.
 Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Lets do it. Lets get ugly. Lets get real.
 Youll notice I didnt have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the balls in their court.
 OK. All right. No. Its good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
  Kelly, how are you?
 Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my...
  All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what its like to be a minority.
 I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
 Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldnt it? If Id brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
 What?
 That doesnt really make sense. Because you dont call them collared people, thats offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, its after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
 Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
 Lets go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
 Lay them on me. What?
 Thats not what you said earlier.
 The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? Thats what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
 I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
 I think it was you who didnt look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
 Well, Id recommend it. Its very good.
 You gotta crack these things open.
 Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It wont be popular decision around the old orifice.
 Well, its a suicide mission, you know.
 There, there...
  When have you ever done that?
 Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
 Theres a decision that needs to be made, and Im having an unbelievably a busy day. So Im going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
 Yeah!
 Really?
 Ah, none. Youre picking a health care plan.
 You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
 Nope, you cannot use it.
 Temporary workspace. You can use it.
 If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and weve talked about that already.
  Pam, Michael Scott. Hows tricks?
 Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears Im busy, busy, busy. Cant step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybodys doing. Everybody cool out there?
 Pam! Whoa, whoa, Im sorry, Im sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. Im getting a call.
 I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just dont let anybody in my office under any conditions today. Im just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
 Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
 Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
 Ah, what? Which memo?
 Is it a good plan?
 Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
 No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why dont you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
 OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, theres some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
 Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesnt matter. The point is, theyre not unhappy anymore. Theyre out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. Hes cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...
 You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
 Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldnt find the knob.
 So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
  Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
 Its says here that its a 300ft drop.
 So its not a free fall?
 Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
 OK, so I dont know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
 Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. Its all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why dont you take two? Because you dont get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
 Why dont you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
 There you go.
 Uh, nope. Nope. This isnt the surprise. Its surprising, um... because you didnt expect it. But you will... youll know it when you see it.
  Oh, Christ.
 Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
 Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
 Oh come on! Thats horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, its after five. Oh, oh its awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
 Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
 All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
 When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
  God, yeah... Ah! This...
 Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  "Hi. Im Mork from Ork." Well, Im Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
 Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
 Theres no downsizing.
 Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
 Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing, okay?
 But theres no downsizing, so just dont...
 Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
 It looks like theres gonna be downsizing. And its part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "Youre fired."  "Youre foir-ed. Uh, youre foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office cant function that way. No way.  "Youre foir-ed."  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "Youre hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But thats unrealistic, so...
 Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
 Who is it? Whos the birthday?
 Next person on the...
 ...calendar.
 Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
 Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, itll be a surprise.
 Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
  Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
 These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing 80s party last year. Off the hook!
 So I was thinking, if you havent already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
 Shes not the only one thats going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. Its not, uh, its not just about her, so...
 Mint chocolate chip! Thatd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
  Can you get her? Shes right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Merediths card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, lets see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard youre turning 46, but, come on, youre an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I dont appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, heres the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. Ive already set the bar really high. And theyre all worried about their jobs, you know. Its kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. Youre great. Love, Michael."
  Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Dont bring that lamb to work or itll poop on the floor.
 Hey, Oscar! Come on in. Whats up?
 Oh, not at all. Come on in. Whats going on?
 What?
 Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
 No, Im always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
 Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. Thats what I say, so...
  Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
 Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
 Theres not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
 I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
  Which one is that again?
 Oh God! Dwight, no. Im trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
 You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. Ill work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
 Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Lets go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
 Its surprise Meredith. One, two...
 Find a key.
 And many more!
 You were surprised, werent you?
 You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hells goin on here?" Good cake. Why dont you have some?
 Come on. A little bit.
 Oh, right. God, too bad. Its so good.
 You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think Id kill myself. Cause this is way, way too good.
 Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
 Well, you know, money isnt everything Jim. Its not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe youll give more than three dollars next time.
 Is Oscar around?
 I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didnt think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
 I know...
 Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
 No, no, no, no, no. That wasnt what I wasnt, that wasnt... No. It-it-its not about the money. Its just... it... its the ethics of the thing, Oscar. Hows your nephew? Is he in good shape?
 How many miles did he do last year?
 Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
 Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
  I dont know about that.
  Huh! Thanks, downer.
 Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because youre gettin old.
  You didnt get the joke. So, thats cool. Thats, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didnt use. Um... Oh, wheres that? Oh, OK, heres a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." Cause Merediths been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
 Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
 Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
 "Shes so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
 That wasnt even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, dont get mad at me.
 This isnt my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
 OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think were losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasnt gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscars nephews... walkathon. $25.
 Per mile, yes.
 When I retire, I... dont want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
 A check for the kids, and for the team.
 I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I dont, I dont know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott."  "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because Im him."
 Come here.  Dont cash that till Friday, OK?
  Hey, you ready?
 All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent.
 Today at lunchtime were going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed theyd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun."  And so I started messing around and... Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, its really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
 Pam, Pam, thank you maam. Messages, please. Thank you.
 No. And thats not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
  When I let him come to my pick-up game...
  I vouched for you.
 I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, heres what Im going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
 Good. Excellent, itll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so were going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobodys gonna want to do it and I know everybodys gonna complain and bitch and I dont want to have to deal with that.
 Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
 No, its not. Its lower, so...
 All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But dont you call it that, Ive earned the right.
 And here we have "Mister Rogers Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. Hes temping upstairs.
 And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
 No, its Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
  And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
 You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her its part of the job!  Rapport!
 So, um, one oclock sharp and weve got a game on.
 Oh, I see, youre chickening out on me. Youre bailing on me.
 Oh, well, Im glad that some time is a busy time because whenever Im down here it doesnt seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you cant take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
 All right, see you at one.
 Are we ready for the game?
 I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
 Nerd. That is why youre not on the team.
 Uh,  "Ill help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
 OK, so, lets put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
 Um, what do you play? Center?
 Uh...
 Uh, I dont know. I dont remember saying that.
 Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
  Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
 Yes.
 Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
 I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
 No.
 No, no, ridiculous.
  Off the backboard!
 Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
 Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
 Oh, yeah right.
 Oh, yuck, thats worse than you playing. ... Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. Thats where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, youre on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
 Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
 Oh ho, oh, hes running. Hes running. Hes running, but he cant hide because you know what? One oclock, you better bring your A game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
 Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, Im gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
 What?
 OK. Cool, youre on.  Dont screw this up.
  Classic beginners mistake, eating before a game.
 Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, lets bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, youre fired. Thats a joke.  OK, lets do it.
 All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
 OK.
 OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
 Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
 Aw, come on Dwight.
 On. Just put it on.
 Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why dont you do the uh, jump ball OK?
 Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Whos on him? Somebody get him!
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Here we go. Three!  Lets go to the zone! Were going to zone!
 Whos got Roy?
  Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those.  Dwight, I was open. All right, lets go.
  OK, foul. Charging. Charging. Thats a foul.
 OK, Ill take it.  OK.
 When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. Its gone, Im in the zone.
  What is wrong with me today?!
 Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I dont know... I might just be a basketball machine. Whats Dunder Mifflin? Ive never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, thats probably gonna happen, actually.
 Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!
 That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
  Nice! Come here!
 Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
 You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
 Football is like rock and roll, its just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? Youre kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. Its all downbeat, its in the pocket, its like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
 All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
 Whats going on? Whats going on? Youre playing like a bunch of girls.
 All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
 Shoot, shoot it.   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
  Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
  Yes!
  Watch the long passes, you guys!
 Dwight!
  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, whats the score?
 Yeah, baby, here we go!
  Jim! Jim! Right here!  Ow! God! Hold it!
 Foul! Foul!
 Oh, that hurts.
 Whats your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
 No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
  Yes, it was. You know what, Im just being fair.
 Game over. Game over. That is it! Im sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, thats just... were having a friendly game. Its a shame. This is a damn shame, but were like a family here and that just, that wont fly.
 Thanks Dwight.
 Well, lets just say whoever was ahead won.
 It was us? Really? I didnt, I didnt know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
 Um... well, you guys, you know, Im the boss so...
 Hey, hey...
  You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that wouldve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. Im embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, were coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
 Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
 Come on. Lets not be gloomy here man. Were all in this together. Were a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobodys coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
 The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you dont win. But we did because we were ahead.
 Affirmative.
 You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
 Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
 Okay
 Uh, huh.
 Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. Thats cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
 Um, question Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman thatve been promoted to...
 I didnt mean me!
 Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
 Its illegal. Cant do that.  Next best thing.
 Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. Thats just stupid.
 Pam!
 Burger with cheese!
 And fries!
 And shake! What? Go ahead.
 No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
 Pam. Pam. Come on, Im busy. So just tell her to go away.
  Oooh, alright Ill talk to her.
 All right girls break it up, youre being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
 Dont say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
 Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh youre like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
 Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. Im  against violence in the workplace.
 Nobody cares what you think.
 So uh, you know what? I usually dont allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. Its yours. All day.
 Well, lets put em in the hallway. Give em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
 I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, thats the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when shes in Phoenix. Illuminating.
 This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, Im right on the other side of this wall.   used to be a window here. Theres not anymore. So, thats where I will be.
 So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just dont hesitate to ask. Im right here.
 Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the bucks.
 Its like a slang for Starbucks. Theyre all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we dont have the good stuff here.
 Nah, its not. its spppplllibbb
 No, heres the thing. Yknow I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and theyre always putting up walls and Im always tearing em down, just breakin down barriers, thats what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
 Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
  There ya go. Nice steaming cup ojoe.
 I have an idea.  Why dont I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
 Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
 Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
 You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that were all millionaires. Im probably closest. So heres Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
 Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
 I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe hed never heard that before he worked here?
 I know, its unbelievable.
 Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
 Toby, Katy.
 Tobys divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
 You and your wife, and you have kids.
 Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
 Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit.  Oh, shes cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
 I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule Just do it. Nike.
 Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?   So hows that uh, coffee from earlier?
 Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
 Busted.
 Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
 Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
 Oh, I know what youre thinking. Youre not prying this out of my hands, but dont tempt me because Ill give it to you!
 Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. Its a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. Its not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
  Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? Whats the matter?
 Oh, oh! God. Im sorry. Is there...?
 Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
 Seriously. No, really.
 God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean Im out of here at five sharp.
 I can go earlier. Cause Im the boss. You know, whatever. Im out of here slaves.
 What?
 Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five oclock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
 Excellent.
 Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.
 I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
 No its not. Because I could just click on the icon and then Im onto---
 No, no, no its not against the rules.  Shes not a permanent employee so its not.
 But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
 She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
 Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
 No. I cannot promise you that.
 Listen, Dwight.
  Dwight, no. I dont know. Its too early to tell. I dont know how I feel.
 Espresso?
 Youre welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
 Ummm-hmmm...
 Very easy to clean.
 Okay. Like hes going to win anyway, right?
 Did we get any mail?
 Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin. Just checkin, double checkin, checkin on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
 Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
 Ryan.
 Would you like to help me with a special project?
 Alright.
  Okay, just throw out all the empties.
 Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
 No.
 Uh, what flavor?
 Blues not a flavor.
 Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
 What, stop! Whoa! Thats my Drakkar Noir.
 No, it is a perfect smell-alike. Im not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
 Not its not, theres some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out.
 Thats over several months, Ryan.
 I think in order to be a ladies man, its imperative that people dont know youre a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I dont know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I dont know. I dont know. Maybe theyre right?  I dont know.
 Sure you dont want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
 See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
 Where you going?
 With us?
 Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
 Alright, have fun.
 Dont drink and drive.
 Take it easy.
 You too, have a good night.
 Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? Id pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
 Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybodys favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here dont get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, whos gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin Donuts? Plus, bonus, its really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and hell tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbors house. Neighbors hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
  Hey hey hey! Its Fat Halpert.
  Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.
 So why dont I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why dont you show of your Dundies to the camera?
 Oh, thats a good idea.
 Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
 T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, its just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Dont go there" but thats... lame.
 And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, arent you Stan? Why dont you, ah, show them some of your bling.
 Oh, no you di-int.
 W-why did you...
 Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
  To Oscar Martinez its the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
  He has the award-ah! ...its a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
  A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
 ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
  ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
  Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
 Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
 Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
 Um...
  Could you...?
 Yeah, Im here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
 Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
 ...come on, Jan!
 Youre dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
 Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
 No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
 ...it happens once every billion years.
 Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
 Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
 This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carsons classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."  Heres the problem. Theres no open bar because of Jan and its the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. Itll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
  The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley.
 Pam, everybody!
 Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? Thats what I have to say. Ah, Roys accepting.
  Thank you Roy. Are there any words youd like to say, on Pams behalf?
  Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
 Im not changing that, its the best one.
 Thats why its funny. Every year that Roy and Pam dont get married, it gets funnier.
 Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.
 Yes.
 Okay, well, thats just ridiculous, so just dont, I-I dont have time for this right now.
 Just dont, dont talk-
 Dont talk-
 Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
 Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Cant you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
 Yeah, not bad, right? So lets make this the best Dundies ever.
 "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. Im psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  Youre just a name and number and no one even says hello."  Card!
 "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
 Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
 Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, were going to be doing separate checks.
 I did. And why didnt ya Stanley?
 Well, Im looking forward to meeting Terri.
  Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
 No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
 And I was about to take her bra off...
 ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
 No!  God.
  Alright, so lets get this party staaaarrrrted.
 Um, guys, where you going? Pam, shows just getting started.
 And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
 ...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
 Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
 What? I told them busiest...idiots.
 Well, well fix it up. You dont have to display that.
  Herro everybodeeee. Im gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
  Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
 Right? You know wat Im talking bout.
 This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
 Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
 Yeah.  "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go.
 And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybodys favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down.
 The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
 Um, not everything means something, its just a joke.
 I dont know, its just...
 I know. Its ju- they didnt have any more businessmen. So...
 Just sit down Kelly.
  Its so freakin hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.  Here we go, hes early with the cue. Here we go.
  "You have won a tiny Dundie."
 Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
 Oh, alright, yeah.
 Uh, you know what guys, were just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
  Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
 Lets cut it.
   I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, Im just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened.  This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Dont Go in There After Me" award. Its for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
 There you go.
  Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, well keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
 You know you did.
 And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
 ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
 It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
 Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go.
 Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
 Was this years Dundies a success? Well, lets see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
 Great work tonight.
 Excellent.
 Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
  Hey, whats up?
 Any emails today?
 No? Um... Check your spam folder.
 What?
||
 Kay.
 I am king of forwards. Its how I like to do business, everybody joking around. Were like Friends. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
 Thats funny! Thats funny. Not offensive. Uh... because its nature. Educational.
 Um, I...
 Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, well see. Because I... I dont know if its...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
 Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
 Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
 Uh oh.
 Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
 Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
 Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade A gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
 Really? Here we go! Buckle up. Its going to be a bumpy one!
 Oh, yeah.
 Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, theres a lot of dumb people out there.
 Oh! Wow! I didnt say it! I didnt say it!
 Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
 Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan?
 Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
 Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. Im going to forward it like its hot.
 Forward it like its hot. Forward it like its hot. "Old School".
 Yes, Toby?
 Um... literally two seconds?
 Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So hes really not a part of our family. Also hes divorced so hes really not a part of his family.
 No, no, Toby. No.
 It is a big deal. Its a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
 What?
 NO!
 What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
 There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. Thats why its a joke.
 Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know youre all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.
 I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just cant wait to see how you handle it.
 A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is whats at stake.
 Time to bring out the big guns. Im heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke thatll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. Im looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
 Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
 Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
 Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
 What?
 I dont feel bad.
 No, I dont.
 Okay.
 Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
 Thank you.
 Hi, is it over?
 No.
 I know, I know. Its good. It is not over. It is not over til its over.
 Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didnt because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what were losing? Seriously?
 Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
 Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirls outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
 I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
 No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
 She would have definitely slept with me.
 Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
 What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?
 What if they made out? In front of everybody?
 At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
 Okay. Well, then lets act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! Well use the doll. Pam. Pam?
 I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Tobys video that hes showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
 Thats what she said. Pam?
 Thats what she sai   Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
 Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video were watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
 So you are the lawyer, Mr. OMalley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
 Well, its probably because you dont get em.
 When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I dont come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldnt arrest a guy whos just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
 The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I cant say anything.
 Wheres the line? Wheres the line, Jan.
 No, Ive seen the video.
 No, I didnt.  Huh, what?
 Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
 Mmmhmm. Yes.
 THATS WHAT SHE SAID!
  Come on.
 Mwah!
 You would have done the same. You just didnt think of it first.
 Its... Thats...
 Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. OMalley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
 I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
 This guy does it all.
 What?
 So Im not in trouble?
 I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You cant be too careful about what you say. Mo money, mo problems.
 Okay. Well, lets get you out of here, James. Um... I think were under an hour still, so...
 I know. Well talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
 No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
 Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
 No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
 I dont know about that.
 Well, I have a late birthday and usually Septembers a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? Theres a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
 Yes, your corner. Go.
 Mmmhmmm.
 They didnt get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  Cmere, cmere, cmon!  Come on! Come on.
 Oooh!
 Im not worried.
 You know what? The only thing Im worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
 Times have changed a little. And even though were still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy cant take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
 Im an early bird, and Im a night owl. So Im wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
 Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
 Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why dont you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
 Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
 Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
 Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and theyd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
 Maybe.
 Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
 Sign the papers at the condo.
 Uh, I dont need one.
 I dont need a representative.
 No, No.
 No. Dwight. Im fine.
 Well, this isnt about work. This is closing on a condo, its completely personal.
 Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
 Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
 As my associate.
 No it is not.
 Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because thats the way they talk in movies.
 We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why dont you have everybody work on their expense reports and Id like them in by the end of the day.
 Very good.
 We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
 Good. The Small Business Man?
 Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
 How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
 NO, well can you get on that, because I dont just read Cracked.  Thank you.
 Ok. See you soon.
 I dont know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
 What? No, Dwight. Its fifty degrees outside.  Dont... please...
 I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
 I do not understand what you spend your money on.
  Home, sweet home.
  Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, its this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
  Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? Hed always get rolled over by something.
  Nice to meet you too.
  Yeah, small. Im buying it and Im not renting it. So, its still an upgrade. He doesnt know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
  Oh. Good. Thats good. Its good to be accommodating of that.
  This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
  Im putting my bed right over here.
  Well, then I will get a warrantee.
  Well then I wont get a warrantee.
  So thats the problem, is solved. What?
  Uh... Ten year.
  What? Wha? You said ten.
  Ok, ok, ok.
  Alright.
  Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
  Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
  Um. Im going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
  Oh, man.
 Uh.
  The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I dont... I dont...
  ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
  Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
  As far as I can tell, Im the best-looking person here.
  Theres a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. Its just sorta common sense, because if you are, then youve no place to go but down.
  No, no, no.
  I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
  Ehhhh....
  I made the right decision. Im glad I signed. Im a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. Were having fun.
  Theres something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
  No, no. I insist. I insist. Because youve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
  Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
  Im thinking, lock into a four year commitment, well go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then youre, you know, youre gone.
  What the hell is a terrarium?
  Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
 We take separate cars.
 Why would we do that?
 No.
 EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. Im sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. Im ... Ok.
 Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
 Nobody likes beets.
 Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why dont you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. Id love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
 Stop it!
 Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. Whats going... Whats going on?
 Oh. Thanks. Thanks. Its very cool. Its a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
 You know.
 Really?
 Whats this?
 I dont really know what to say. Um, Im not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
 Get up here, Dwight.
 Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?
 Oh.  What the hell is that?
 Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and hes kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
 Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!
 Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
 Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
 That is ridiculous.
 Ryans about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. Im like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
  Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is?
 Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
 There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
 And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
   Hey!
 Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, Ive heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
 Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
 Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? Thats rule number two.
 So what was rule two?
 Okay, well, lets... . lets kind of take it a little slower.
 Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
 Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
 Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
 Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or Im seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
 Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
 Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. M is for Murder, P is for...
 ...for Phone. What?
 Um, oh, thinking about business school?
 Really?
 So you think you know a lot about business?
 Uh huh.
 Yeah. Quiz me.
 Come on, egghead. Lets do it.
 Quiz me up.
 Uh...
 When I was Ryans age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
  Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, its equal.
 Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
 Okay, Dwight.
 You know what, Dwight? You dont need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then youd know what youre talking about.
 For instance, why dont you go to business...
 Stop. Dwight. You know what? Youre acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! Hes not your five year old brother, Dwight. Hes a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
 I did not go to business school. You know who else didnt go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so its not the same thing. At all.
 Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
 You are so smart. You are so eff-in smart. You should be teaching me.
 I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? Im very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
 Nah, Im okay.
 Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
 Oh, I play this at home all the time while Im falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
 Aaaall right. Whos next, whos next, whos next, whos? Jim? Youre next. Who would you do?
 Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. Cause he is going to own his own business.
 Whos, uh... Whos next? Who we got? Whooo...
 Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
 Whats that?
 Yeah.
 Dwight. Hey!
 Dwight, dont! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
 I didnt say it to him. I said it about him.
  How long does it take to find a cell phone? I dont know either.
 Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. Itll make it easier for him to find.
 I gave it to you in the car.
 I saw you program it in.
 Okay. Alright.
 Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir...
 Dwight!? Great goin. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
 Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they dont teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
 Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
 Toaster Oven 101?
 Hey! I know whatll impress everybody, Ill start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
  ...since the world was turning.
 Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. dont burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
 Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
 Ill give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
 Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... thats great!
 Ohh... OK.
 I know why shes calling. Its the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow Im supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.
 Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
 Well, Im gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said its best to wait till the end of the day.
 I dont know... yet. I will have to call her back.
 Okay... Sherri?
 If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
 Thanks.
 Ill call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
 Okay! Im sorry.
 No?
 Bye.
 I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. Its... these are peoples lives youre talking about.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yeeesh.
 Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing Ive ever had to do.
 Because its very scary stuff.
 Youre worried about the party? Theres a mans life at stake here.
 No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
 And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
 I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
 Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
 Hey.
 You guys excited about the party?
 Its gonna be fun.
  Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
 All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
 Well, you know what? Go buy some more. Ill approve the overages. Sound good?
 Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, Im  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. Im going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
 Well, thats not what Im saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
 Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
 "Bend It Like Beckham."
  Yeah. That would be perfect.
 Well, I dont really have two heads. So...
 Who do you think it should be?
 No, Jim brings in money.
 Eh.
 Its not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
  What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
 Youre right, I didnt even think of him.
 Yeah, thats actually a really good idea.
 Yeah... I could.
 Im not saying thats what he said.
  What?
 That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
 Are you kidding?
 I agree. Hed land on his feet.
 So. How did it go with Stanley? How... howd he take it?
 Ahh, come on.
 I dont wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. Im certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...
 Oh, God.
 Fantastic!
 What?! That wouldve solved all my problems.
  Oh, you idiot.
 If you left, I wouldnt have to fire anybody.
 Big deal. Oh, it wouldve worked out so well. Can you get it back?
 You can call. Can you call em?
 Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
  Can I speak to you a minute?
 Help. Me.
 I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
 Yes.
 I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
 No, no, no. Thats just the first thing... came... in head.
 Yes, thats a good idea.
 Aaaahh! Im gonna kill myself!
 Im going to kill myself, and its your fault!
 Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And theyre saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
 I... this is Creed.
 Im improvising, so just try to keep up.
 And Im very angry, and I want...
 Im gonna kill you. Im going to kill you for firing me.
 Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
 Uh, hey... Creed?
 Could I talk to you for a second?
 You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that youd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
 I... were gonna have to... You... you want something better.
 No, you wanna leave.
 Why... why are you making this so hard?
 I think youre right.
 No, of course  you cant go. We havent even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think youre a great guy, and I like you, youre... youre, goodbye.
 Hmm?
 What old days? What are you talking about?
 Its right here on the desk, yeah.
 I cant, I cant...
 I cant change anything. This is the way...
 I dont... okay, just listen.
 Dont...
 Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
 I have to fire someone today, okay?
 Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, youre always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
 Dont...
 Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
 Well, he...
 Well, maybe I did.
 Huh. No! I cant, no. I cant go back. I would look like an idiot.
 No.
 No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
 I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
 Devon, wait, please.
 Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chilis. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
 I  love Halloween. You know, its just, its just fun. Every year, its just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jacksons boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
 He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
 You look great! And youre a princess?
 A fairy princess. Youre very... .
 Youre a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, thats all yours. Thats all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
  I dont want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
 Uhh, yes, I did, heres the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
  Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
 Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
 Last year they were out of order, werent they Pam?
 Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. Thats pretty good. Um, actually, Im sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
 Is it a priority? Oh I dont know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? Peoples legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I cant because we dont have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasnt a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. Thats the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
 Catch-22. Yes. Why dont you give me your contact information to start with, ok, whats your cell?
  Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
 This is Tito.
 Calling from...
  Pick up.
  This is Mike Tyson.
 And this is more a ying-yang thing. The Michael all cursive, the Scott all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
 Yeah, yeah, I dont think that would happen.
 Because I would kick his ass.
 So? Ive beaten up black belts.
 They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, Im just lucky I got out.
 And after that, nobody ever messed with the Damn Rascals ever again.
 You were a Jet?
 Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some ts and dot some is. Alright, Im going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. Thats my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
 Im friends with everybody in this office. Were all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that arent dentist appointments. And thats when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
 Just hit me. Youll see.
 Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. Thats a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
 Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
 Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented Armageddon...
 ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
 Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
 Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
 Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
 Yeah.  Thank you.
  Go away.
 I havent signed them, ok?
 Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight cant stop you from being mugged. Hes just not tough enough.
 Oh, I could beat up Dwight. Thats ridiculous. I could murder him.
 Oh, so thats what they are saying?
 Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
 Ok.
 Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
 No, Really?
 Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
 Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.
 Really?
 You know what? Youre just lucky that we are at work right now.
 No, they must have class.
 Look...
 Hey, Toby.
 Ive got an idea why dont you leave right now. Why dont you walk away from the room, kay? Fine. Well go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
 I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
 I think it is. A guy told me about that.
 Oh.
 Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didnt have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
 Hey!
 What the hell was that?
 No.
 Alright, thats the way you want it.
 Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
 Im comin atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
 I got his pants.
 Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!
 Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
 You cant see. You cant see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points.
 Open your mouth.
 You talkin to me? You talkin to me? "Raging Bull." Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. Thisll be hilarious.  Oh, were playing phone tag.
 My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
  Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
 He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
  Yeah.
 Yeah, just throw them on the chair. Ill take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
 If youre doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
 Alright, bye.
 Dwight?
 This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
 Well,  busier. Making the time.
 Well, you dont even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
 I know, but Ive been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, itd might help me out. What do you say? Lets gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
 I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
 And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
 I know, I know, I know, I wouldnt be offering it if I didnt think you could handle it.
 No, no, title change only.
 No, no. Three month probationary period. Lets not tell anybody about this right now.
 Absolutely but not really.
 Yes you do.
 And, ditto.
 I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
 Wow, graphs and charts, somebodys really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
 I changed it.  To Chilis.
 Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, Im doing business at the Radisson".  Its kind of snooty.  So.
 Heres the thing. Chilis is the new golf course.  Its where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
 It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
 Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
 Ok, lets do this thing.   Wish us luck.
  Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
 Well...
 No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just dont get very much work done when Im not here.   Thats not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when Im not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.   Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what were gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesnt matter, its an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.   Adios!
 Uh, Ill drive.
 Its just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really dont know Scranton, do you?
 At all!
 You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
 Dar de dar.
 Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasnt moving, you might think she was dead.
 We should come up with a signal of some sort.
 Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
 Well, I... it could be either of us.
 Yeees.
 Hello?  Christian?
 Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
 No Gould?
 Uh, Jan, what happened?
 Is Gould dead?  What uh-
 Wow, youre kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
 When did this happen?
 Ok.
 Alright, after you.
||
 Awesome blossom.
  I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
 Ok, its done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now its done.
 I heard a-
 Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
 Ok.
 Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if its just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... lets see... choo choo choo.
 Pam, its Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
 Yes.
 No.
 Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
 Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
 First guy says "Well, Im an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn".  And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort".  And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, Im a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".
   Yum! Yum yum yum!   Thats delicious!  I love it!
 Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
 Thats why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldnt have to just shout non-sense words.  Thats her fault.
 Did somebody say "baby back ribs"?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back
  Chilis baby back ribs...
 Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
 Oh, so youre not gonna play?  Shes not playing.
 Shes not playing the game.
 Check please.
 No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
 You know?
 Its true.
 Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  Its home, you know?  I know the challenges this countys up against.  Heres the thing about those discount suppliers.  They dont care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once were all gone, they jack up the prices.
 Its bad.
 It, you know what, it really is.
 Well, corporates gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
   See ya.
 We did it!
 Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
 What!?
 Goin. Ok.  Where we goin?  Doesnt matter.  Goin to the go go.  Oh-ok.
 Morning, Pam.  Hey.
 No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, Im, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, Im not, I dont want to go into it at all.  Its off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.
 Hello, Dwight.
 Who.
 Uh, no, no, no Gould.
 This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
 And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I dont think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.   Jan, I defend your honor.    Is that all?
 I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I dont know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  Its, uh,  Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  Hows traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No.   Would you excuse me?  No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no.  This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights were gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I dont understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think youre still a little bit drunk  Excuse me?  Excuse me?!   I think youre, yes, why dont you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didnt slip you something!
 Pam, could I see you in my office?
 Pam, youre trustworthy-
 And a woman-
 And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, its Jan. I guess I missed you.  Ill, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope its understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."  First impressions?
 My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that well be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didnt want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didnt want it, we both didnt want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say somethings mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
  "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
 But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".  That doesnt mean anything, those are just words.
 Ok. Yeah, what, what?
 Ohhh, great.  Well, now Im in a terrible mood.  Lets do your performance review-
 Ah, why, thats great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
 Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, lets listen to that again.  "Michael, its Jan.  I guess I missed you".
 Really?
 God, Stanley, thats frickin brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
 No kidding.
 Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
 Yeah?
 Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
 Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasnt so mutual after all.  Yeah?
 Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
 Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chilis.
 Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chilis.
 Oh.
 Been thinking about you.
 Um, I dont see how thats unprofessional. Just-
 Yep.
 No.
 They are not.  Yes, they are.   Thats my girlfriend.
 Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A "Michael-idea" folder?
 Thats unfortunate.  How bout the suggestion box?  Theres tons of ideas in there.
 The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe theres prizes?
 Why dont you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, Ill tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinsons coming, very soon, and so, were going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
 What did I say?
 Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. K?
 Hi, Jan.  How are you?
 Good to see you.
 Ok.  Ok, why dont we just step into my office?  Were gonna go in here.
 Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous.  No calls.
 Alright .
 Its nice to see you.
 Really?
 Oh, well.
 Alright.
 Yep.
 Absolutely.
 Im a little confused.  Cause first its all like kissy-kissy.  And then its like all regret.  Because "Oh, I regret that."  But, "Wait, Im still gonna call you."  But, but, "Were just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you dont do your job."  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.
 No, no, no, I finished all of that.  Im very fast.  Im not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya maam.  But I do say thank ya maam.  But, Im, Im not like wham-bam.  Not that theres anything wrong with wham-bam.  If its consensual.    Were talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
 This is a business question. Its nothing personal, I promise.
 Are you wearing a new perfume today?
 Well, youre wearing it at the office. And  it, Im sorry, but no offense, but its really sexy.
 I dont understand-  Hold on.  Sorry.   Yes, Pam.
 Im kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldnt interrupt.
 I did not, not, not use those words.
 No, its in like ten minutes.
 Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of dont think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, lets, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"
 Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
 And, um, one down.  Next suggestion "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
 Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
 Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
 Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
 Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
 Ok, I dont know who this suggestion is meant for, but its more of a personal suggestion and its not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
 Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
 Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when were on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think its something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that weve learned this, lets continue.  See, this is good, were learning and were figuring some stuff out.  "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
 Ok.
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I dont think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
 Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
 Ill work on that-
 Lets keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebodys piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I dont wanna have to read these tomorrow.
 Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
 "Dont sl-", ok, thats blank  Dont, just put it-
 I dont understand why youre so upset.
 Let me ask you-
 Ok, let me ask you this.
 Let me ask you something.
 Where did you get your outfit?
 I just dont understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
 Look-
 Oh my God...
 What do you want Dwight?
 Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
 You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
 Why on earth would we give you a raise?
 You do?  How do you get in?
 That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a mans heart.
 Ok, third wheel, why dont you do that?
 That was deer!? Gross, oh!
 Oh, did not!
 What do you say, Jan?
 Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
 Thats from Superman?
 Wait.
 Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
 Ok, so youre saying that there is a different time or place?
 Well, ok, well never as in never ever ever, or never as in theres still a chance?
 I just want to know, from the horses mouth, what is the dealio?
 Am I too short?
 Really?
 I appreciate that, thank you.
 No, I wasnt, I didnt cry-
 So my looks have nothing to do with it?
 Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesnt matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; Im good.  I can go home now.
 Hey, its 1220; where the hells Dwight?
 Never missed a day, my ass.
 It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.   Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend youre not here.
 Theres no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody.
 The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
 Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
 Oh...
 Oh, umm...
 Yes.
 AH! Guh-oood.
 Please dont do that.
 I cant tell you.
 I dont have to tell you anything.
 Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  Im in the best shape of my life.  Look at this.  Brrr!  Thats strong!
 Im not going get a brain-
 Stop it.
 Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why dont you just go... away?
 There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that Ill be reading their e-mails.
 So how do you search?
 Try "profits".  No! Try "Michael Scott".  "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  Oh my God, wow!    E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.    "Sorry I didnt write back sooner; I cant go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."  Well, Stanleys an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
 Oh, no, everybody; Oscars gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That Im a robot?   I will destroy everything in my path-
 Beep! Bop!
 Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.   Oil can. Oil can.
 Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
 You know what the problem is?
 The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think its scary or bad, but I dont. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
 Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jims tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... . No.
 Theres always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just natures rule.  Its intimidation mostly, its the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
 Of course.  Hangin with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
 Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybodyd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
 Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
 Hey there.
 Almost quittin time.
 One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I dont know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya dont, we could hang out.
 You have plans.
 I do, too. I do, too.
 I do, yeah. Big plans.
 Tonight, I cant do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
 Yeah.
 Its the best.  Its the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
 It is. Ok.
  What?
 Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
 Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
 Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
 Ok, alright.
 Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin off to?
 Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
 Liar!
 You are a liar.
 Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why dont we watch that show that youve been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
 Thats, whatever stupid show you want-
 To watch tonight
 Were watching it.
 I didnt know you played soccer, Dwight.
 You, too, Dwight?
  Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
  Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  Im with the FBI.
 Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun.   Thats why I always start with a gun, because you cant top it, you just cant.
 Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom!   Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didnt you?  Didnt ya!?  Well, you didnt, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.    Boom! Boom! Boom!
 Boom! Boom!
 Boom! Boom!
 Why
 Well, if you hadnt stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
 Boring.
 I could of-
 Ok.
 Yehhhehh.
 Im in.
 No, no, no.  Im looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
 What are you...
 Nothing.
 Good, its good.  Good work, everybody.
 So Bernies, huh?  Were all going to Bernies?   Go to Bernies?
 Right, right, right.  Well guys, Id love to go to Bernies with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Cant get out of it.
 Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
 Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  Im just driving by, thought Id drop in.   Theres some wine. I would love a glass, if youre gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!   Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, lets get this party started, ha! Ok?  Wheres that wine?
 Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.    Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I cant explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin on.  Tender love is blind---
 Were making love!
 Talk! Just talk!
 Shut up!
 Funny story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey youre funny, youre the funniest guy Ive ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."   And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
 Here we are.
 Oh god.
 No, no, turn it around.
 Youll break it.
 You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Dont break the branches, Dwight.
 All right.
 Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
 On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
 Merry Christmas!
 Did it work?
 A, thats what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
 Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. Thats what Christmas is all about.
   Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. Im kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
 Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
 It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 Gs. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
 I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And Ill be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
 Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
 No! No way! It... no.
 You wanna be Santa?
 Have you ever seen Santa?
 Okay.
 Well, Im sorry. It just doesnt work.
 That makes sense because he has elfish features.
 You get something good this year?
 Yeah? Who did you have?
 I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
 I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
 Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
 It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
 All right, lets count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
 Not great.
 No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, lets do Secret Santa.
 Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. Its like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
 No, dont!
 Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
 You dont know that.
 I did?
 What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesnt matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
 Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
 An oven mitt? Okay.
 So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitts worth." I gave Ryan an iPod.
 I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
 One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that persons gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose a new gift.
 Well, I call it fun!
 Because its better. Because its more special.
 Shut it. No, its not. Okay, just give it a shot.
 Okay, Meredith is up first. Heres the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten, like the oven mitt.
 Yankee Swap! Thats what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
 I think this is going great.
 Everyone wants the iPod. Its a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
 Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
  I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. Its beautiful.
 Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
 Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I dont know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
  "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
 Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
 Last gift. Kevin.
  What is she so upset about?
 Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think its a success and Im the one who ended up with Dwights stupid paintball pellets.
 Well, I didnt. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
 It wasnt. It wasnt that much. It was $3,000.
 Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your partys so lame.
 All right, now, youre the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
 Cool, cool. Box it up.
 Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
 This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
 Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, its a party. Come on. If I cant throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
 Go, here we go!
 Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, hows it going in here?
 No, no, no, no. Well find some, dont leave the party.
 Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
 Not bad. And if it couldnt go to Ryan, you are the guy Id want it to go to.
 Youre welcome.
 No way. Oh, youre kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
 Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
 Oh, lets fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Tobys gonna fix you up.
 Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
 No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
 Hey, Merry Christmas.
  Lampshade on head! Its happening!
 Yeah, that sounds good.
 Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. Whats better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. Its really the greatest day of all time.
 Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richards?
 Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, lets head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
 Okay!
 Hello, everyone.
 Ah! Ha ha ha!
 Yeah?
 Stanley! Bo banley.
 Banana fana fo fanley.
 Be my mo manley.
 Stanley.
 Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isnt it?
 Maybe, I dont know.
 Well, no. But... okay, dont spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
 Its cheaper.
 This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? Im going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
 It is now time to unveil the destination of this years retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. Its a booze cruise!
 No. This is mandatory. But dont worry, you know what? Youre gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
 Well, this...
 Yeah?
 To throw you off the scent.
 Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
 Well, thats not my fault, okay? Just.. were not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what youre all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
 I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasnt the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And Ive incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
 Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But were all in the same boat. Teamwork!
 Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
 Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
 All right, lets not get hung up on the furnace. This just... its the sales... I see the sales department down there. Theyre in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
 Titanic?
 No, Im Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
 No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. Theyre happy down there in the furnace room. And theyre dirty and grimy and sweaty, and theyre singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
 The... no, no. No, I didnt... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what Im saying is... leadership. Well talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
  A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
 Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
 Id rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
 Okay.
 In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? Its nebulose.
 Hey, look! Im king of the world!
 And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
 Okay! So...
 Right.
 But dont worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
 Im your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
 Rock it!
 If the boats a-rockin, dont come knockin!
 Yep.
 Were all gonna have a good time tonight!
 Hm? Okay. Yep.
 Having fun?
 Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
 Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
 So, okay.
 But before that, I have to do my presentation.
 All right, well have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
 Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss thats always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
 Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
 No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
 Okay, well, obviously you dont know anything about leadership.
 Okay.
 Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
 I dont want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
 Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
 Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
 Then Ill give you away!
 Captain Jack is a fart face. Im on medication.
 Vomicillin. Okay. All right. Its time to be boss. Its time to motivate. Lets blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? Were going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, its my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there arent enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? Its a scary... its a...
 Its a predicament, and its something that each and every one of us has to think about.
 Im in the brig. See? The boats not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
 Is somebody there?
 Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
 He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
 Well, its nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
 Roy said the first one didnt count.
 Really? Youre kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
 Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
 Well, if you like her so much, dont give up.
 BFD. Engaged aint married.
 Never, ever, ever give up.
 Its a fake wheel, dummy.
 Pam! Its Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
 Im hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
 Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
 No, I want you to pick me up.
 I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
 I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up.
 OH GOD!
 Oh God!
 OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
 I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I dont have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, its good for me.  Its the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... thats it.  I dont see whats so hard to believe about that.
 Pam, could you come get me?!
 Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
 Theres no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell em that?
 I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
  No one wants to pick me up!?
 Im not sick! Im burned!
 Dont... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
 I dont want Dwight!
 I dont have a girlfriend.
 It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
 Hellooo? ... Please dont send Dwight!
 Morning everyone.  Dont freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that Ive been through.
 Did you explain why?
 Burned my foot, Pam.
 Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
 Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
 Thank you.  Pam, messages please?
 Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
 No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
 What?
 I dont want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member whos undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I dont think thats too much to ask.
 No, I dont want some aspirin, yeah Im a little fussy.  Aspirins not gonna do a damn thing.  Im sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
 What?  Part of your duties are to what?
 You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
 Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
 Where is my cornbread?
 Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
 Where are the yams?
 Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
 And they had no yams?
 How strange.  Because they always have yams.
 Pam... PAAAM!?
 Come here please.
 I want you to rub butter on my foot.
 Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
 Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
 No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, Im not gonna call Jan.  Shed just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?
  No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
 I fell off the toilet.  Im caught between the toilet and the wall.
 Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
 Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
 No, hes not.
 I just saw him.
 Ugh, forget it.  Ill just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
 Can I have everyones attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, whos supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what its like to be disabled?  Oscar?
 No, never heard of it.  No, a
 Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although Im sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
 Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!
 Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
  I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybodys in there!
 While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
 Good question.  Forrest Gump mentally challenged, Philadelphia  AIDS.
 I dont think so, no.
 He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
 What you mean uh hmmm... ?
 Ok.
 Yes, right in here, come on in.
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
 You are so brave. You are so brave.
 But its hard for you! Right? Because youre in a wheelchair.
 Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
 Oh my God, thats three times as long as it takes me.
 How did you get in your wheelchair?
 Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
 Well, thats good, he still has a sense of humor.
 Well they notice it.  Dont you?  You notice it.  Its the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isnt it?
 Ok...
 Ignore him.  You know what?  Were not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
 Yeah...
 Ok.
 Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
  Hey!
 You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
 Did you get the yams?
  Ok, Ill just have the pudding.
 Yeh.
 You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
 Yeah, baby, I am feelin better.  My bodys literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
 Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
 Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
 Why dont you go with him?
 I cant take you, I dont have my car and yours is all vomity.
 Oh, ok, thats, great.  No, I cant drive.  Jim why dont you drive.
 Well go.  Im still recovering. So lets just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
 Shotgun!
 The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout "shotgun" when youre within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  Thats how  the games played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
 Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Merediths problem?
 Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  Shes not gonna find one driving this thing around.
 Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, Im so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
 I know, just sayin.
 Dwight, what are you drinking?
 Give it to me.
 Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.   Give me the bottle or youre fired.
 Give it to me Dwight.
 Give me the bottle!!
 Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
 Just give it!
 Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!
 Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
 Dwight, what is your middle name.
  Something with a "K".
 What do I write under "reason for visit"?
 Nothing.  I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
 No... you know what Jim, this isnt about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.
 Hi Dwight.
 Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
 Well, you dont have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
 Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
 Ok, what kinda machine is that?
 Thats my joke, damnit Dwight.
 Its ok, theyre with me.
 Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
 Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  Well, see you when you get out.
 Fine. Fine.
 Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Wheres the funny? Give it to me.
 Whats up-dog?
 Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, thats brilliant!
 Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
 Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
 I dont know, nothin, whats up with you?
  No, damn it!
 What does what mean?
 Just forget it.
 Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
 Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin how ya doing?
  Damn it.
 Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you dont have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...
 No, thats not... no, thats not what I was going to say.
 Yes.
 On a Friday?
 I will do all the talking.
 What difference does it make whether your here?
 Hi, Oscar its Michael.
 Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
 Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know its cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
 What are your symptoms?
 Umm, hmmm.
 I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless youre still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
 He sounded sick.
 Thats exactly what I was thinking.
 Yeah. Drop what youre doing. Make this a priority. Because an office cant function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
 Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why dont you wear your hair like that all the time.  Its much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.
 Hey Jim-bag.
 Really?
 Who else knows?
 Wow!
 Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
 My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.
  Can you hear me, they talk about us...
 Hey, whatcha gettin?
 Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
 Any of em?  So, uh, whats the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
 P-A-M. P-A
 No its okay, were talking code.
 Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
 Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
  Peach iced tea. Youre going to hate it.
 Its Grrrrrrape! Soda.
 Not so much.
 Nothing.
 Fact I love grape soda. I always have. Fact Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
 Um, I dont know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
 Ok.
 Good.
 Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin for lunch?
 Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why dont, why dont I take you out to lunch? My treat.
 Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some za. Talk about you know who.
 I know just he place.
  Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
 Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
 Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 oclock. Hi.
 Were not worthy. Were not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
 Im his boss actually.  And I treat him well. Im taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
 Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
 Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
 No, Im gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
 What do you like best about Pam?
 Is it her boobs, or...
 Really?
 Never gets any of my jokes.
 Her boobs, definitely.
 Oh, thank you.
 Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
 Woo! Yeah!
 Thank you very much.
 Hilarious. Hey.
 Just go to his house and see if hes sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
 Just do it.
  Expenses.
 No. Its... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
 Yeah, its a business lunch.
 No he did not. I dont need his permission.
 Uhhh its ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they dont understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
 I put a cigarette through a freakin quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
 Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
 Youre not his friend, you dont know. He is in love with a girl he works with whos engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
 You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
 I know, I know, I know.
 I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. Im just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesnt affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
 Ok, Im fine, no I know, Im good, Im good, its just.
 Yeah Im good.
 Yeah Im fine. Look, about you and Jim.
 No, I feel its my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
 It wasnt that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
 Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. Im done. Thats it. Im out.
 People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I dont, I dont want to live like that. I like it here. I dont want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
 Spamster!
 Hamster.
 Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
 Yeah?
 Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
 I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay.  Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
 Wow!  What happened in there?
 There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
 Is it a bird?
 Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
 Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
 Check it out.
 Check it out.  Dont be a wuss, just get... no, Im not holding your coffee.
 What is it?
 What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
 I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
 How do you know that?  What is it, then?
  Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great.
 That is worse.
   I am a big Fear Factor fan.  Im a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um...    I cant stand it , I cant stay in here another second.  No!
   Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
 Oh... Its ...
  Yeah ...
 No, no, no!  Seriously, I dont mind sharing.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
 Dont ape me.
 This is great.
 The pressures of my office are insane.
 I just... you couldnt understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
 Yeah.
 Ed Truck.   Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work."  What a jerk.  Hes... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
 You know who used to sit at that desk?
 Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
 Yeah.
 He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  Hed come in and sit there sometimes.
 When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office .  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that
 I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
 Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
 Another time, Packer held this guys head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasnt hired.
 Charley horse!
 Charley horse!
 Oh, okay.  Gah.
 Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.   It was hysterical.
  Dwight.
 Lets send up Accounting.
 Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
 Hey guys.
 Ahem.  Whats up?
 Yeah! Oh ho ho
 No, no, no, no.  We dont do that.  We dont do that.
 Watch out, Pam. Youre next!
 Maybe!
 Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I dont know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesnt do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.
 You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
 Stop.
 Stop it.  Stop.  It.   Dont.  Dont.
 All right.
 Hi, guys.
 Im just walking around.
 Well, yeah.
 Oh, and Im not?  Why would you say that? Because Im having fun?  You guys just are workin for the weekend, arent you?  Im workin for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what were gonna do.  Im gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, Im gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
  Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and Im going to ...  ... Im gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jims clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Lets see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
 Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
 God, this is gonna be fun.
  So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that!   Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  Thats my sale!
  Nothing.
 No.  Just ...
 You know what, guys?  Its none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
 Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
 Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
 This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.
 You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  Were... were not... were not doin this today.
 You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and Ill explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
 I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what Im talkin about.
 Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, wed be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.
 Youre all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly.   No.  NO!
 Do you remember Ed Truck?
 How would I know?
 My biggest fear is turning into him.
   I wasnt talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
  Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin back.
 Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really dont wanna be up there right now.
 Oh, no, no, no.  Youre good.  It was clerical.  Youre good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
 I didnt get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
 Really?
 Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
 Well... s-sure I can.
 Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
 Well, okay.  Different management styles.
 Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I dont have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney."
  Yes.
 Who is this?  How did you get this number?
 Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin?
 Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
 Really?
 Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
 Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
 Are you kidding me?  Oh!
 That was Packer!  Oh, youre... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
 Oh.   Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
 It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I dont expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  Its ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun.  We just have fun!  Oh, Im just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
  Hey, whats going on?
 Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
 Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that todays woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
 No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
 They did this up in Albany...
 And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
 Well, Im their boss, so I feel like...
  Anybody want any coffee or...
 Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. Women of the workplace. About what? I dont know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
 Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. Youre a guy... too... sort of. Lets do this!
  Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Lets just clap.
 Lets just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!
 Thats what Im talking about!
 Just having a little guys in the workplace thing.
 Why cant boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
 We have nowhere else Jan. This...
 OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? Theres another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, theres another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real mans work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
 Oh, I think its going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I havent been there in months.
 So lets meet the warehouse! Lets get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
 You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. Theres Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, shes our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
 Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
 Roy and Pam. Its a Ram. Its a Ram thing.
  Uhhuhhuh. Just in case theres someone down here who shouldnt be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I dont see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
 Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I dont think... You.. Youre... My job sucks compared to this. I dont think youd like it up there.
 Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
 Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
 Hey, youre going to, going to hurt yourself.
 Stand clear.
 Im fine, Im fine. Im fine.
 Oh, oh, oh!  Well get somebody to clean that up.
 We ought to have this thing serviced.
 So! Guys gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. Thats going to happen, you know. Were guys, so...
 No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
 Stay or...
 Lets start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
 OK.
 OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
 I... That was just...
 I was breathing.
 I hate shushing. You know, thats the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
 OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. Thats what guys do... and we love it.
 I feel you.
 Yes.
 Ah, you do. So...
 I know. God! What is that?
 It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
 No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
 You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
 Dockworkers?
 Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
 The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
 Yeah-es.
  This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
 Dont get hysterical.
 Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
 Lets... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
 Dont talk to me that way please. Just... theyre going to want to hear this from you.
 But were bonding down there!
 I mean I just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear.
 Ok. Come on Jan. After all weve been through...
 We have a history...
 ...between us.
 I wont
 Im just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
 Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
 Hi.
 Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
 I have essentially. Yes. Ive taken some...
 Im just going to put this over there.
 You did uh... okay.
 Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
 Hey. Um... look guys, Im sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
 Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
 Thank you to our hosts.
 Ahhh! Excellent.
 Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
 Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
 Nope. The opposite of that.
 Ok, good.
 I probably will, why do you ask?
 Yeah.
||
 This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentines Day. Its New York. City of Love.
 Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
 Alright.
 Dude, Im gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
 Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
 The meeting isnt til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And Im gonna go get me a New York slice.
 Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when youre in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, thats pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
 Everybody takes the subway in New York. Its fast, its efficient, gets you there on time. Its a way to  Okay, theres a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
 This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and its, thats Tina Fey . Thats Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, Im sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasnt. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
 I would love to live in New York someday. Its a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. Itd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, thats either the Hudson or the East, so were back,  should be back this way. Theres a lotta pressure on me right now. Its like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as its over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Lets do it.
 There they are. Whats up? Hey hey.
 Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
 Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.
 You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
 So whats going on? What I miss?
 Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...
 Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, thats not. Cool it.
 Maybe because shes my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. Shes... we hooked up and...
 You know, months ago, just once, Its, just stupid. Just forget it,
 Yeah, yeah.
 Ditto.  How are you Jan?
 What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.
  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And thats the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, were not just in the paper business, were in the people business. Lets meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanleys dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business were hoping to build our bases on.
 Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably wont. You know, not what this is about.
  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What its like to walk a mile in Oscars shoes. Or try on Phyllis pants.  Maybe even one of Angelas famous brownies. And youll know, that youre home.
 Questions?
 Yes, thank you.
 Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...
 Oh, ok. Alright.
 No youre not.
 Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
 Yes. Im sorry. I will fix this. Ill talk to him. Ill talk to David.
 I am serious. And dont call me Shirley. Airplane.
 No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, heres the deal. Its my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.
 I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, hes not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
 I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, Im really sorry. It will never happen again.
 Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
 Yeah, Happy Valentines Day.
 Oy vey... schmear.
 Lets think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
 Could go either way. We dont know what they are going to say.
 Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
 No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I dont like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
 Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
  Hey, Dwight.
 You all right Ryan?
 Pam!
 Thats what she said!
 Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
 Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
 Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, youre awesome! Heres a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Heres a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
 That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
 Thats because youre incapable of doing it because you dont know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, theres no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
 But I can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company.
 Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
 Dont. Dont try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
 Insult.
  But seriously, whats the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
 Its a joke, Dwight. Its not a Sex Ed class.
 Yeah, youre right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
 I do. Both of them.
 No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesnt matter what you say. It just matters that youre saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
 Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
  Congratulations.
 You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
 No, no! Its not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. Theyll eat it up. Theyre a great audience.
 Hes kidding. Dwight was kidding and I dont know why because it wasnt funny... and it was just horrible.
 Yeah.
 All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Lets go. Lets do it.
 As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. Were all going to go around the room and were going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
 Pam! Im public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
 Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
 Oh ho hokay. You know what? Thats not a toast. Youre not standing up.
 Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
 Well, its mostly made up. So...
 Dwight is not going to do a job. Its sad. And theyre expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
 Confidence, Dwight.
 Its time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
 All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. Its a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. Were down here. Right.
 Dwight, they called your name.
 All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. Im going to cover for you.  All right!
 Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
 Im very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the Police Academy movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?
 Car starting.   All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
 Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
 I got thirsty. Howd it go?
 You would not believe what happened here.
 Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
 Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like I dont have my ID, please give me one. And he was like I cant do that. I cant serve you.
 She might have been. So she says Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. Ill show you my ID. She hasnt come back yet. Shes probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
 Dwight gave a great speech. Thats the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
 Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
 ... Oh, God is that today?
 Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kids environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what Im going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still.
 Well, Ill be in my office.
 Theyre cool.
 Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. Im Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, whatll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
 Okay, Im Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
  I work with a bunch of nerds.
 Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, youve really grown up. You know what? Dont mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
 Oh.
 Yeah, middle schools amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
 Its not that children make me uncomfortable, its just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? Ive never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
  They want how many spiral pads?
 Okay.
  Just compare last years order to this years. Uh-huh. Yeah, Im looking at it right now.  ... Yes. We--yeah, theyre very--theyre different.  Yeah, we can stick with last years, youre just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
  Yes. Well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? Ill call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. Thats--- thats alright.  Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My names Michael. Whats your name?
 Nice to meet you.
 Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like Im the conductor.  But Im sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?
 All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!
 Dwight! Dwight!
 What the hell are you reading to them?
 Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids dont want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
 Whats a Nazi?
 Dont!
 Dont! Dont! Dont talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? Theyre going to have nightmares, so why dont you just shut it?
  Why dont you just leave? Okay?
 Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
 Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.
 This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? Thats paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
 No, we dont actually cut the paper. Thats a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
 Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
 Im not just a middle... man...
 You are describing Office Depot, and theyre kind of running us out of business.
 ...Theres Creed! Lets take a look at what hes doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
 Say hi to the kids.
 Yaaaaay.
 What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
 No no no, were not gonna see--- were not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
 You know, theres something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
 Its true. I did.
 I am totally serious. There was a show called Fundle Bundle and I was the star.
 Its true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mothers house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled Fundle Bundle. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
 I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
 Oka--
 Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
  Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
 I dont get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... Theyre adults, for Gods sake.
 I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called Fundle Bundle. Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
 That... is Miss Trudy. Cant tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
 Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
 Yeah.
 Uhh, I dont know.
 Can everyone please shut up, please! So you dont miss it.
 Oh! Thats me. Shh. Shh.
 Coulda sworn there was...
 ...uh, no.
 Uh, just never happened.
 Uh, nope.
 I do okay.
 Yes.
 Okay! Alright, okay.
 ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and Im going to go do my work. Bye.
  Yeah?
 Oh, thats okay, she can keep those.
 Thank you.
 You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
 Well, sure, playing the field is great, dont get me wrong, but theres more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
 Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
 What about...
 ...Jan. Kay.
 ...Or biologically.
 Thanks, thats, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
 Oh... kay.
 Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
 Hey, uh, no, please? You cant leave yet. Theres still one more thing we need to do.
  You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
 One more time.  You...
 So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
 Dont worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
 You know what? Thats a nice attitude, Ryan, Im just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
 Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
 You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
 Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money were all going to make. Its not a pyramid scheme, it is a... its not even a scheme per se, its...  ... I have to go make a call.
 Oh ho ho! What?
 Thank you! Thats really nice.
 Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I dont know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
 Whats up?
 Ah, thank you sir.
  Yeah.
 Ohh, god.
 No no no, no, new suit, please.
 Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
 Good luck. One of a kind.
 Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  Theyve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
 Dont! Nope! Please, dont want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
 Lets get the party started.  Not the way I taught you!
  Yeah?
 Oh, great, put her through.
 Hey, you.
 It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
 Really? Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
 Thanks.
 Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
  ...You can take a five, if you want.
 Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
 Thanks.
 Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
 You didnt know it was my birthday.
 Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
 Mmm.
 Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
  Okay. Im so nervous.
 When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
  Stop it. Stop! What is that?
 Yeah, well, its on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
 Youre making it worse. I bet Luke Perrys friends dont treat him like this .
 What?
  Ohhh, God.
 Ohhh, no.
 Ohh, no, no, no! I cant... Ryan, come on. Lets do this.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
 Get in here... everybody.
 Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
 The best.
 Yes.
 Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
 Just the bread, its fresh baked.
 Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
 When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasnt even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
 Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
 Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
 Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
 ... I asked for trick candles.
 Okay. Well, when she comes back well do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Havent had a hug all day.
 ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, thats good timing. Thats... thats, sorry, thats terrible. Terrible news. Thats terrible... terrible news for both of us .
 There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
 Yeah, but its not brain cancer. And it shouldnt stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
 And laughter... also.
 Why are you here? I didnt even invite you to my birthday party.
  Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesnt speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
 Well, youre pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
 Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, were going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
 How dare you sir. You are gross.
  That should not be there.
 No, its alright. Its already up. Just leave it. Wheres Kevin? Come on! Lets get our skate on!
 Yeah, Ive been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, youre on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
 Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, its pretty scary. And Im thinking that uh, next time youre in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
 Kevin. You heard anything yet?
 Okay. Well. Live strong.
 Alright.
 Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
 Oh, these... all your kids?
 Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
 Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin now!
 Push. Good! Thats great. You got it.  Excuse me.
 Oh... God...  God!  Were gonna beat this, okay? Were gonna... come here .
 Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
 Okay, whos this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
 Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
 Thank you... Dwight. Thats great. Thanks.
 Yeah.
 Oh! You didnt need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
 Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, youre totally harshing the office mellow.
  Narc!
 I wasnt attempting to compliment you.
 Uuf, well...
  Okay...
 Why dont you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, wheres my office?  I totally lost it, cause I was half-baked. Smokin doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
 Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
 Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Whos he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
 Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, whos in trouble?
 Waa... what? What are you talking about?
 Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I dont know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and Im sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
 Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
 I can do that, it is my office.
 It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
 No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, hes right? What hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
 I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
 Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
 Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
 Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
 Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
 Yes it is.
 Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Tobys urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
 I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
 Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? Im going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
 Really?
 Jim its okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  Its okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, hes doing it, okay.  Its okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.
 The point Im trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all dont quite hate em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
 Yes, I will not be.
 Okay, well Dwight just know that Ive been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasnt planning on going to the bathroom and I dont even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
 So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
 Just forget it.  Just the urine.
 Just. I need your urine.
 Yes in a cup, were not animals, Dwight.
 Its none of your business.
 Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
 I need clean urine for the lady.
 Dont think of it that way. Its like, urine goes all over the place. You know, theres no controlling it. It just... goes
 A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
 No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
 Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
 Whats wrong? Wheres your costume?
 Why?  Wha...
 Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and Ive decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
 Yes, sir.
 So you wanna? Thanks.
 Okay.
 Good.
 No. Oh. Uh...
 Alright.  Well, Thank you.
 Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sams. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. Were doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
 Thats a nice tie.
 That is... who makes that?
 Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
  Whats the dealio?
 Whats the problem?
 So what, youre having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
 Yes.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
 Okay... what?
 Yeah, well... thats not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we dont get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
  A mediators tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
 No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
 Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
 Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
  Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
 Come on, seriously, that?
 Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
 Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
 Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
 Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
  It is done!
 Yes.
 Are those all the other complains?
 I would like to see those please.
 You cant do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
 Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
 Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
  This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
 You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
 How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
 Thats what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
 Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
  All right, Pamela. Come on down! Lets do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
 Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldnt she do that at home?"  Who else? Why dont we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
 Here is a Kelly complaint "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.
  Makin progress.  Yes?
 What?!
 Stanley.
  You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
 Someone complained that the mens room is "whites only". Stanley, you know thats not true.
 Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angelas giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
 And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
 Oh... ok.
 Okay, well... all settled, then.
 OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
 All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
 Uh. Dwight.
 Okay! Calm down.
 Hey, hey!
 Stop.
 Okay...
 Dwight...
 Stop...
 Oh... kay...
 Okay.
 Yes.
 Mm-hmm.
  You know your I.D. says youre a security threat?
 Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
 Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didnt work, everybody would still be in the cage.
 Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."  "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
  "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."  "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the womans room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."  Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
  "Every time I typed my name, it said Diapers."
 "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
 The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. Ive never had one. They sound awful.
 Hey, theres like, 300 more of these. Lets get to them later.
 Maybe, I havent decided yet. Lets get to work.
 Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrows not good. How about later in the week?
 Good. Okay.
 Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while youre here?
 Well... thats... what, a computer camera, right?
 Itll take like two seconds.
 Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
 Come on, everybody.
 We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
 Good, lets check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. Well take one more.
 What?
  You just press the button.
  Okay, good. Check that out.
  Thats terrible.
  Lets pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.
  It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
  One, two.. Didnt say three, did I?
 But, Im sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You cant outrun your problems.
 And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But heres the thing about cage matches sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
 Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know its illegal in Pennsylvania, but its for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. Its just... Its nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good.
 I try not to think of it as lagging behind. Its more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
 Top 80 percent!
 Yeah?
 Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
 Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but were having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
 I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
 Oh, come on. Come on.
 You know, itd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
 Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but weve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
 Okay, everybody. Tonights event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
 Well, they need our money. They dont have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
 Well, Oscar, if you dont like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
 So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
 Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
 Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
 Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? Were gonna...
 Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesnt exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
 No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
 What?
 Thats a dog.
 Thats a shawl.
 No. Humans with AIDS.
 Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
 There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. Its one of my dreams.
 I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
 Its Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
 Well, actually, its my warehouse.
 Why are you here?
 Not. I said, not that.
 Thats ironic.
 That you are afraid.
 Dinkin flicka.
 Give me some.
  Yes
 Who?
 Do I know a Carol Stills?
 Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
 Hi, Carol. How you doing?
 Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
 Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. Its okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
 Actually, Im sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
 Yeah, itll be good. You know what? Why dont you come by? Bring the papers, Ill sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
 Yeah. Itll be fun. What do you... What do you...
 Oh, Im sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
 Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
 Hey, Jan. How you doing?
 I am?
 Oh, okay.
 AIDS.
 Okay, sounds great.
 Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
 Right.
 Yeah?
 What?
 Okay.
 Problem. Good.
 Good, All right. Sounds great.
 Bye.
 Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
 Hey, hey.
 Hey, Carol.
 You look great.
 Oh, well... Kiss.  Thats how we do it in the paper biz. Its European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight
 Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
 Okay.
 Billy, your nurse is hot.
 Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
 Chilis is great.
 Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
 Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Lets get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
 All-in.
 Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because Im not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
 What are... Thats insane.
 Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesnt that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So dont be stupid. Just take it back.
 Okay, all right, whatever.
 You really screwed that up.
 Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck werent involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 Jan.
 Look, okay, I think were all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
 After you said you werent coming, I invited Carol to come and I dont think that I did anything wrong.
 Um...
 Hey. What...
 All right!
 Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!
 Yeah!
 So close. So close.
 Hey, okay.
 Thank you.
 Okay. Thanks for coming.
 Okay. Talk to you Monday.
 Good night. Shes a good boss.
 Oh, shes great.
 Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, Ive got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
  No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive?
 Thats what faggie means!
 It wasnt just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
 Exactly!
 Yeah, I know.
 OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
 I would have never called him that if I knew.  You dont... You dont call retarded people "retards".  Its bad taste.  You call your friends "retards" when theyre acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.
 Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
 No.  No its not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I dont know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  Im just... I, I cant even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
  Can you tell whos gay and whos not?
 What about Oscar?
 Well, he
  There could be others...  I need to know.  I dont want to offend anybody else.
 Yeah, Im sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
  Hey, what about Angela?   Shes hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
  I dont know, I can imagine her with another woman, cant you?
 Do some research.  Find out if theres a way to tell by just looking at them.
  Thats ridiculous.
   Lets call him and get the website.
 Well, theyre sold out.
 I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
 What?  What does that even...
  Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  Its not like gay... shame festival.
 I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
 I dont kn--
 Anythings possible.
  Well, Im not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
 The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
  Trick question!  Cause you cant always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
  Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, its all goooooood!  I dont particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.
  All right, everybody in the conference room!  I dont care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!
  Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
  Were all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays arent necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  Im doing this for you.
  Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
  Yes, thats a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
  Thats great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!   See?  Everybody has a chance!
  But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
  Right!   And I take that as a compliment.
  Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
  No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
 No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is
  Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
  You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, Im gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you cant catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
 ...and I just dont care who sees it, doesnt bother me!
 All right, um... sorry.
  Im sorry I called you faggie.  Youre not faggie.  Youre a a good guy.
  You know what, Im going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.    I did it.  See.  Im still here.  Were all still here.
    Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
  We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe its supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
  I am glad that today spurred social change.  Thats part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didnt, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...thats what she said.  Or he said.
  Oh, theres Gill.  Oscars roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
 Pam?
 Did you see Oprah yesterday?
 I, uh... I am going to be a father.
 Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
 I know.
 Well...
 Just do it, okay?
 Um... find out if theres a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
 Eight months?
 I dont even know if Ill want a baby in eight months.
 You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I havent had a baby, and you havent had a baby...
 Twenty years.
 Thirty.
 Its a deal.
 Yesh.
 Right there. Ah.
 Per diem.
 Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. Hes been stuck working under Josh, the poor mans Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
 Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
 Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
 Yeah, do it!
 Really? Okay. Well, word of advice unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
 Um. Okay, um.
 You got that?
 Write it down.
 Um.
 Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
 Good to see you. There he is! Theres the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
 I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. Its like the firemen. You dont leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
 Yeah! Wow, I didnt expect that. Its good to see you too!
 Hey!
 Ah.
 Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
 The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. Im still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
 Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
 I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
 That is crooked on that side.
 Hey hey!
 Yeah.
 Well, thats how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There aint no party like a Scranton party, cause a Scranton party dont stop.
 Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
 Wish I was. I love inside jokes. Id love to be a part of one someday.
 All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
 Ugh, that would be gross. Its not even lunch yet.
 SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
 Check it out. Hi, Im Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
 You know what? Im having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
 Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people youre gonna be there?
 So maybe. See ya.
 Because hes afraid to fly.
 Do you remember me from last year? Theres a party in my room, 308, cant miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
 Yep. Yeah, shes up front.
 I dont have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
  See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?
 I need you to do something for me.
 I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
 And?
 Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
 Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
 I will call him later with that message.
 Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
 Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
 Hey, Jan, Jan? Dont worry, I have got the tip.
 Youre welcome.
 No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
 I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
 The party Im having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
 Any messages for 308? All right.
 Hey hey, fellers.
 Whats up?
 Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
 Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
 Okay! Excellent. Oh...
 Shut it.  Hey, Pam, whats up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!
 Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
 You first.
 Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
 Well, lets...
 Come on!
 Come on!
 Fine.
 Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think its talking and being friends, and Jim thinks its moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, Im done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
 Okay, let me tell you what were looking for.
 Sorry, my meeting ran late.
 Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
 Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
 Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
 Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
 This is the party.
 Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.
 People have been filtering in and out.
 What?
 Sure. You like Cosmos?
 Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
 I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And thats just...
 Im not better than Josh.
 Oh my God. You dont even know. Shes single now.
 Im sorry, man. Im sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
 Yeah.
 I will. Ill talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how youre feeling.
 Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
 Evan, this is Jim.
 Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
 Best friends.
 Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, Im popular." But not me. Im very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, youll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it cant be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
 Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.
 Whoa. What are those stains?
 Oh, God, I hope its urine.
  Ahhhhhhhhh.  Im hungry.
 Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
 Lets gooooo! Lets go, lets go, lets go!
 Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
 Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
 Entourage!
 Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
 Dont whine.  Get the window.
 Previously on Varsity Blues...
  Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
 People work faster after...
 No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
 Ok.
 Ouchy.
 Three hours, wow.  Have fun.
 Hi.
 Oh.  Thats nice.
 ...what?
 ...you were at the dentist?
 Ok.
  What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  Shes my ex-lover!  ...ish.
 Hey Dwight.
 Do you want an M&M?
 No seriously.  You should have an M&M, theyre really good.
 Theyre good, huh?
 Hey.  I thought you werent supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after youve had a crown put in.
 Sounds like a good dentist.
 Whats his name?
 Your dentists name is Crentist.
 Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
 Let me see your teeth.  Let me see em.  Let me see em.
 You should... floss.
  Well then... I am glad youre ok.
 Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?   Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tigers head.  We dont have the technology.
 Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
  Wow, this is tough.
  Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!
 Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
  Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
 And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
 I know.  I told her I didnt know whether youd wanna do it... because youve always been so loyal to me.  Youve been my most trusted ally.
 Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
  Perfect, well, were settled.
 All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
 Ohh..
  Cant you?  Thats so nice.
 Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
 Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
 You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
 Because, Dwight... never lies.
 Because thats all it takes.
 Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
 Oh, Ill be fine.
 No, no, I dont, but---
 I... wont.   I wont.
 Well, I guess its time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
 Its a corporate lease Dwight, youve earned it.
 What?
 But you said you liked it.  Youve always admired it.
  Take it back.
 Thats my car.
 THATS MY CAR.
 I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
 Jan called me about your little meeting!
 I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
 Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
 Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
 Not.  Good.  Enough!
 I have a laundry machine!
 I dont know if I can trust you anymore.
 You can get up.  Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.
 Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And theyre done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesnt translate.
  Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and Im making him do my laundry for a year.
 Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
 Oh, its okay, Im going down.
 All right, Ill be right back.
   There you go.
 Youre welcome.
 Dont mind if I do.  See you in a minute.
 There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
 Theres coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
  All right.  Okay.
 I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.
  All right.
 Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
 Oh, wow.
 Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
 Yes, I am.  Its very sad.  Because he was my boss.
 Thats right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, Ill be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
 So did you hear the news?
 Yeah.
 Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  Its... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
||
 Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
 Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin.
 The older you get, the bigger the chance is youre gonna die.  You knew that.
 What?
 Oh my God.
 That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, Im sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
  So, Im not exactly sure how to say this...
 What are you doing?
 I didnt... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And thats when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
 I dont understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didnt even work here.
 You really dont get it, do you?  You dont understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
  A statue.
 Yeah.
 Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
 We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
 I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
 Life-size.
 Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
 Mm hm.
 Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
 But Ed truck cant because he is---
  DEAD.
 Thats perfect.
 Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
 What?
 Well, you know what?  I didnt wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I cant stop picturing it.  He leaves work, hes on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
 Well, you know what?  Theres something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you dont wanna talk about it, you dont wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
 There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad.  And thats   hard.  And its making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then Ill have done my job.
 I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and Im crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
 Okay, fine.  Hurry back.
  Okay, we can start.  Um...
 Yeah.  Pam, youre a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
 Okay, why dont you throw the ball to somebody else.
  Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
 Okay... Im going to toss the ball to Pam.
 Wow.  If you wanna cry, thats okay.
 Do you want to talk about it anymore?
 Wait a second.  Thats Weekend at Bernies.  Do you think that this is a game?
 All right, were starting over.
 You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
 Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk.
 How do you know?
 That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
 Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didnt.  Youre not a veterinarian.  You dont know ANYTHING!
  Oh, God!
 Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
 Oh shhhh--oot!
 No, hes not.
 No, hes not.
 Well, you cant get diseases from a bird!
 We dont know if its dead.
 Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
 Well, Im sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
 No, no, no!  Thats enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.
 Its okay.  Its okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. Its been a tough day, but its good to let it show.
 What are... What are you doing?
 No, God, no its not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
 Glad you could all make it.
 Dwight, do you have the box?
 You made this?  Wow.  Thats... thats very nice.
 Yes.
 Shhh.
 Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, thats baloney, because grief isnt wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
 Uhhh... nothing.
 Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
 Wow. Well. Ok. I dont care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
 I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
 Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
 Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
 Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So Im just going to have my soft pretzel, then Ill get to work, and Ill be super productive. Look out for me.
  Oh, shhh... Come on.
 Uh huh.
  Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
 No, I think youre cutting in line.
 No, Im not going to settle down.
 Get in the back please.
 Boooooo. Thank you. . Thats right.
 No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman Id like to see. You read my mind.
 I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. Youre an angel.
 Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
 Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. Ill be back.
 Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
 Thank God.
 Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
 All right! Thank you!
 Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. Whats going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Lets make a deal. So what is the deal?
 Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
 Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
 And I will be taking questions.
 Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, Im going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think were getting a lot done, dont you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
 Hey, what time is it?
 AM or PM?
 Oh, good.
 Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
 Yes. Right. Good.
 Goodnight!
 Nice dress, Ryan.
  OK.
 Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  its ada blah blah blah, its so super fun and its going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
 How come you didnt get me one?
 Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
 Its important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
 Wha? Really? You should! Its fun.
 I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... dont really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I dont want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
 Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, Im a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
 Kelly?
 Um... why dont you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
 All right, all right, all right, all right. This isnt Lord of the Rings.
 Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and thats true, but its also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense, Sig...
 Okay. Spoiler... alert.
 Just stop it.  Whats the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from?
 And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Whos seen that before?
 Thank you, Kevin.
 Well, I find it beautiful.
 No...
 No, Youre not going to collect them.
 No. This is delightful, charming culture.
 My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. Its just sex. People... everybody does it. Im doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
  What does that look like to you?
 No ones even going to notice.
 Hey, Kevin. Its a costume. Why dont you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
 Ill have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
 Oh, yuck.
 No. These smores are disgusting.
 Do you think they have any smores?
 All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
 Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
 Wow.
 Oh! Shes not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, were not married... yet!
 She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. Its still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
 Im going to be.  Hi, Im just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? Im sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know youre all thinking who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about? Well, Im not crazy. Maybe Im crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
 What do you say?
 I didnt hear you.
  Oh, youve got to be kidding me. Okay.
 No. I get it. I get it. Youre not ready. Well wait. This is a classic...
 Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like Ive known you many lifetimes. Maybe Im Hindu after all. Okay, Im not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
 Yes.
 Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why dont I come with you. Cause Ive got this book called the Kama Sutra.
 All right. Good night.
 Oh, God!  Oh. Wow.
 Thats so spicy.
 Oh. You waiting for a call?
 Wow. Pam. When Carol said No. tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
 I was in that marriage arena, though.
 Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
 Were so alike. So alike.
 What are you doing?
 Im... what? I didnt
  Can I have a ride home?
 These are not my shoes. This is just like that show Taxi Cab Confessions.
 Sorry.
 This is going out to Indians everywhere. Its a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, its time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But its not Christmas, its Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Dont invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If youre Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
 There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
 ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
 Yes.
 I dont understand.
 On whoms authority?
 What?
 Youre welcome.
 Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
 Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I dont really get it cause were not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
 Well...
 Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
 Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
 It is an outrage, thats all. Its... heyre making a huge, huge mistake. Lets see Josh replace these people. Lets see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they dont. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
 Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.
 Dont say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
 Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
 Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
 Nothing. Just checking in. I cant tell you, so...
 Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make?  Well be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
 What?
 Do I have any messages?
 Ok, ok...
  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
 You knew about this all along, didnt you?
 Traitor. You are a traitor.
 I dont know. Probably not. This is the worst.
 Darryl. Noble Darryl.
 I know, I know. Well, Ill land on my feet. Dont worry about me.
 So, youll be okay too. Youre a warrior. Youre smart, capable. Youll find something else and...
 Awesome.
 This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
 All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Lets go.
 Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
 Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him hes making a mistake... save the branch.
 No... way.
 No. Theres no one else.
 Okay, okay. Um...
 Why?
 You sent him cards? You never met him.
 Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and hes like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. Youre a bad person." Its very dramatic.  Although, I cant say I was a big fan of  Bowling for Columbine, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like Kingpin. And it wasnt. It was something else.
 I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
 All right.
 Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
 Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
 Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. Hes not going to say any of that.
 Because hed be intimidated and I, just... lets start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
 Dont touch me this time.
 Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
||
 The office.
 No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
 Anything?
 What if this doesnt work? What is the office actually goes under?
  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
 That was hilarious. The foam ...
 Oh, right. Okay, thats enough. Thats good.
 Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
 God, Dwight!
 What are we still doing here? Its over. Lets go home. Get the car.
 Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybodys jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
 What?!
 We did it? We did it.
 Right here! Right here!
 Yeah, baby!
 We did it!
 How did we do it?
 I dont understand.
 Here... Whos here?
 Yes, please.
 Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
 Okay.
 My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. Thats all Im going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.
 Whos next?
 Andy Bernard.
 Saint Bernard.
 What?
 Im not...
 Im not firing somebody on the first day.
 Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man whos way out of your league.
 Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
 Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
 You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as Im concerned,  this says Worlds Best Dad.
 Ah! There he is Tony... whats your last name?
 Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
 Well, theyre just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
 Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
 Welcome.
 Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
 Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
 Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
 A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
 Oh.
 They are nifty! Theyre nifty gifties.
 You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
  No way. Get him out of here. We dont want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
 Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
 Right.
  I present the orientation video.
 Not now.
 I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
 It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
 I dont care! Dwight! You all report to me! Thats all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
 Work it out amongst your selves!
 Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
 Will you?
 Please?
 Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why dont we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
 Yoko shack.
 Nope, no. Guests only.
 Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
 Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
 No, its not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
 Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
 Lets face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But its not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. Its funny. Its got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what were all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what were all about here in Scranton. So lets just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
 Sittin in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin.
 So check out how we live
 They call it Scranton.
 The Electric City. Scranton.
 The Electric City. Call poison control if youre bit by a spider.
  I am so scared... when people dont label their personal food.
 You like coal mines and you wanna see em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
 Well, so far, I think it is killin. I thought it would either be an A or an A+ but I completely forgot that theres an A++.
 Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
 All right.
 Okay.
 What is that? A squids eye or...
 How did you...
 People hate people that are different from them. Thats natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the Integration Celebration. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
 I know what a lot of you must be thinking. Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. Theres supposed to be music and its... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
 Ssshh stupid! Um...
 Thats it!
 Yes, yes! Okay!
 Okay, here we go.
 Oh!
 Oh! Oh! Oh!
 Scuse me! Scuse me!
 You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
 You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, whys my nose so itchy!
  Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
 Okay! Okay!
 All right, all right, Im on a roll.
 Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
 Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
 I understand. Were all friends.
 Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
 You know what? Ill help. I will...
 Dont be shy! Dwight! Lets do this!
 Come on. Were doing this thing! Lets get up.
 Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Im under this... Im under this hock here. I dont know what Im grabbing here.
 Weve almost got it. Push it! Push it!
 Im right in your crack!
 Up and over.
 Up and over.
 Youve got it.
 Youve got it, youve got it.
 Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
 Easy.
 Dont...
 What...
 I dont understand.
 Well, well squeeze you in.
 You cant quit! On the first day. Thats  heresy, my friend!  Okay, lets talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause hes... what?
 My management style? So... didnt you think Lazy Scranton was funny?
 Okay. Well, dont bother quitting because youre fired.
 You are fired! Im sorry, but we dont have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
 Dont try to apologize to me, man! Its too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
 Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
 Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
 No. We do have to get along. Cant we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
 The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
 Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
 Yeah! They punkd us! They punkd us good! Come on. Come on!
 Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
 Yeah.
 Go home, Toby. Just...
 Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. Its so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
 No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. Youre playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Dont, oh...
 THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
 See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although thatll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!
 Hi, Jan!
 I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
 Yes.
 But do you realize that that was actually Dwights idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
 What?
 Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
 So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
 Uh... that I have not decided yet.
 Thank you, Andy. Thats... very kind. Thanks.
 Shut it...
 Shut it! Thats...  suck up!
 Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
 Ohh. May I?
  Hey, look at me, Im a baby! Im one of those babies from "Look Whos Talking." What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! Whats a stapler!? I dont even know, Im a baby! Hey, Mom, Im thirsty! Im thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
 Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I dont know.
 I didnt hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... Im just kidding.
 Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
 Hannah?
 Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
 Because you think hes black.
 Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
 Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guys lake.
 In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
 Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
 Good. All right.
 Just... try to be cool.
 Okay, are you cool, really?
 Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
 Hey Martin, hows it going?
 Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesnt is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
 ...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
 Who?
 Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
 Yup.
 Apollo Creed.
 Close your eyes. Picture a convict. Whats he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... yo, thats shizzle. Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
 No. Thats not cool. You dont have to tell them.
  That is awesome.
 Well, we are running a business, so.
 Ah. Well. Thats not true.
 No you would not.
 This place is not prison. Its... way better than prison.
 Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So lets go!
 Why dont we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
 Its uh... two and a half. Im not going for bulk, Im going for tone.
 Yeah, its... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, youve got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
 Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
 Ah. A ten inch black and white?
 These people dont realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
 All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, theres somebody Id like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . Im prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
 Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, thats just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebodys bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Dont drop the soap! Dont drop the soap!
 Internet.
 And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what Im saying. Its not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
 I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... presidents son. And held him for ransom.
 And I nevah got caught, neither.
 Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
 The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And theyd come down, and theyd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
 No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobodys bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesnt sound so great, does it?
 Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.
 No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what its like to have freedom. And if this doesnt bother them, then I am out of ideas.
 They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
 Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
  Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why dont you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
 Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
 Im looking for the toy drive box.
 OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope itll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
 Umm... I dont know? Average kind?
 Well, that is probably from the test drive.
 No.
 Oh, thanks.
 Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didnt have to do that.
 OK. Did everybody get one of these?
 Terrific. Good.
 This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  Ive got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, were leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
 There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  Youre about five hours early to the party. Youre such a blonde.
 Hey, everybody. I dont know who you havent met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show em, show em the other side.
 Turn around, turn around. Come on.
 No, you get outta here.
 Yes.
 Thank you.
 Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
 That is my Christmas card. Its a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
 I know.
 Right.
 Yes, but what you didnt realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
 And next to your kids. What?
 I dont understand?
 OK
 No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, youre not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaicas largest fresh water pool.
 I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
 And its all inclusive.
 Yes.
 No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
 Id like everybodys attention. Christmas is canceled.
 Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Years.
 Jim, take New Years away from Stanley.
 Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just dont think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
 Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
 Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
 It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
 Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
 And not that you didnt want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what Im referring to?
 Take it from Toby.
 Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
 Its all...  OK.
 What are you doing?
 Carol?
 I dont have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
 This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
 All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
 Hooters?
 Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. Cmon, were going to Asian Hooters.
 Why not?
 Ok, feel better.
 Cmon Jim, lets go.
 Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly shes not yo ho no mo.
 Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. Theyre on a date. They look very happy.
 Carol used to drink lattes.
 She would get this little foam mustache...
 And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And shed say, thats not funny.
 She totally got me. She understood that we didnt have to laugh to enjoy ---
 Im already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I cant, OK, Im gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
 Im just gonna call her.
 Nothing hes doing is cheering me up.
 Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
 Youre right. Thats good.
 I dont know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
 Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak.
 Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.
 I dont think... I love it!
  I dont know what hes doing.
 You know what we should do?
 We should invite them to the Christmas party.
 Oh, you are such mench my friend.
 OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
 The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
 Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, its yours.
 Oh.  Thats what she said.
 Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
 Oh, party in the break room! Lets go, lets go! Thank God! Lets go to the break room.
 Shhh... Shut it! Cmon! Party.
 Were going to ...
 I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree?
 Do you agree about what?  Wow. Youre  lucky youre so darn cute.
 Whatre you talking about?
 When you know, you just know.
 Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
 Its... its one of those two.
 Yeah... well, its been hard, theyre wearing the exact same uniform. And Ive been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
 I honestly dont see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesnt love his wife just because hes not sure what she looks like?
 Hey. Wheres my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I dont know where she is. Cause Im drunk, I cant even find her.
 Haha, I do! I just havent hugged you in awhile
 Oh, good. That felt good. Lets go. Party.
 Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
 No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
 Where do you wanna go?
 I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
 You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
 That waitress was the one.
 How can you be sure?
 Dont make fun... Youre making fun of me.
 I guess, I didnt know her very well. I marked her arm.
 I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I dont... I know, I know. I cant believe I gave her my bike!
 Oh, why do I feel like crap?
 I had rebound? Yeah.
 I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didnt score and Im not sure whos actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesnt matter. Its all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. Theres this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you wont be disappointed. Umm, Its all-inclusive...
 Hey, mon!
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
 Just relax, OK? Ill get to all of it later.
 Arent you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
 It was
 Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
 OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
 Well, I am just getting settled in. So, Im gonna...
 You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
 Feelin hot, hot, hot!  Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Feelin hot, hot, hot! Thats all I know so far, but Im gonna keep practicing.
 You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
 Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
 Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
 Inventorys at the end of December.
 I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
 Inventory is boring. In the islands, they dont make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
 Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
 The Jamaicans dont have a word for "impossible."
 How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. Thats all you need.
 Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
 No, no, no. No, thats a German woman named Urkel Grue.
 Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. Thats all Im gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
  Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
 Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
 Well Im looking at a photo, right now. And Im telling ya, could be in Maxim.
 Oh no?
 OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
 Check it again. Hit refresh.
 OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
 Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Wheres Darryl?
 OK, Hey, man, hows it going?
 Thats great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
 OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
 OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
 And you sent that out to everyone?
 I have a special assignment for you.
 A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
 Not important.
 OK, forget it.
 Not now, not ever.
 Aww, none of your business.
 That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
 This is probably the icebreaker you need.
 I bet you would love all the details, wouldnt you? Skeevy little perv.
 No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
 OK.
 Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her Im not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
 She bought it?  OK. OK.
 There an accident? Somebody hurt?
 Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
 All right.
 Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
 No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
 My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Lets be professional, all right?
 Feelin... feelin hot, hot, hot!
 Hey.
 Island living. You know?
 Did she say what its about?
 There are copies in the bathroom?
 All right.
 Guh.
 OK, yup.
 I...
 I... I... Yes.
 OK, yeah.
 Who is Dr. Perry? I...
 And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
 So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
 Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -
 Jan, you... complete... me.
  Jim, could you come in here please?
 Sorry, oh wow, thats so rude. Im sorry, I cant control him.
 You know what? Get Pam.
 Pam.
 Oh, that is gross.
 Damn it.
 Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
 Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
 Oh.
 Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
 Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
 Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
 You cant pass. Youve got to pick somebody.
 So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
 Dwight?
 Here ya go.
 Please.
 Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
 No, were just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
 Just bragging rights.
 Its just... brrrrrr... Its "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? Were in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Lets do it.
 Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
 Here we go.
 Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
 Hawkman.
  Lets go. The mens room was disgusting.
 Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
 You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
 You know what? Lets get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
 I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
 No.
 Stop it.  Stop it.
 Yes.
 Ah, no. Dont worry about it.
 What?
 I dont know. Who knows how words are formed.
 Yes, Andy.
 He didnt say.
 No, you are remembering it wrong.
 Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
 I knew it.
 Where were you this morning?
 Why do you lie, liar?
 You are lying right now.
 I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
 Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
 Dont. Dont you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
 Good luck.
 Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
 Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
 I said was.
 What does that even mean? That is impossible.
 But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybodys spirits.
 Hey, whats up.
 Yep.
 I dont know. Maybe.
 Bathroom.
 Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
 Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
 Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
 Yeah, do you?
 What did I say?
 Huh.
 Oh, no.
 No, hey, hey. Dont be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
 No, no, no. I mean, not because youre gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscars Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
 Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, lets get him one.
 Whos that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
 Hey guys. Hows the workload on all of Dwights old accounts? Handling it okay?
 Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
 Really?
 Dont - dont do that. Thats not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
 Nice to have Oscar back.
 Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
 Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
 Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
 Um.
 No. I dont want to do any of that.
 No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. Youre going to drive me crazy.
 Hey.
 Whats up?
 Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
 Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
 Hows this place treating you?
 Oh, well.
 No. Im sure.
 So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
 We can talk about that.  All right.
 Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
 Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. Youre gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
 Guilty.
 Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
 So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
 Wow. Thank you. Wow, thats-- thanks so much.
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?
 It takes a big man to admit his mistake and thats what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I dont want somebody sucking up to me because they think Im going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
 Hello son.  If youre watching this, that means Im already dead.  Life is a road---
 How, would you stop interrupting please?
 Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
 Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother wont be able to.
 To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
 Number eight, learn how to take off a womans bra.
 We will demonstrate on Pam.
 Come on.
  You just twist your hand until something breaks.
 Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
 And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
 Hes not going to be a murderer.
 You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
 Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
 Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis wedding.   So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you dont already have one.  This may be Phyllis only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.
 Im sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
 Im trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which wont be hard, because its going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, thats for sure.  Itll probably be on a boat.
 Whats up spinsters?
 No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 230 to 315.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guys night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, its more of a guys afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- its uh, not gay, its just a, its a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
 Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh!
 Oh God-
 No, no, no!
 I cant believe youre not going to be there.  Its going to be good, its going to be a great bachelor party man.
 You should get out of them.
 Its the only time he can do it.  230 to 315.  Its going to be great.  Were going to be doing some darts, were going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
 I did not order a stripper.
 Um, not personally, no.
 I cant get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
 So thats what that means.
 Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!
 Gay.
 Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
 Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
 Well get on it.  And make it happen.
||
  Gotcha, oh!  Yes?
 Im in the, Im in the sex shop.
 Squarepants?
 And you think thatd be sexy?
 Oh.
 Oh.  Hello!
 You wearing a thong?
 Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Whos a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
 Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
 Hes in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
 Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
 And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
 Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one.
 Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
 No.  Yes.
 But I got all the foot off of it.
 Guys, beef!  Its whats for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
 Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
 I call shuffle.  Here we go.
 Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody Id like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
 Nice outfit.
 Hes right there.  There he is.
 Okay.  Alright, Ill do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
 Alright.
 Okay.
 Here we go.  Alright!
 Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
 You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
 Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and Im sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!
 On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand Im afraid shes going to dump me.
 Really.
 Well, Ben Franklin, youre really kind of a sleezebag.
 Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
 Wow.  Thank you.
 Not really, look I dont know how to say this so I just will.
 I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
 No, today at work.
 Yes. I kind of arranged it.
 So you dont want to end our relationship?
 That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
 You are.  You are.
 So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth cant.
 Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
 Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her fathers wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like Im paying for the wedding. Which Im happy to do. Its a big day for Phyllis. But its an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
 There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
 How you doin? You excited.
 Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
 Youre probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? Its okay, if you did. Its a very natural reaction. Its your wedding. And youre nervous...
 Okay... umm... Im sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
 Here, let me...
 Just cover up that bald patch.
 Okay.
 You might be surprised to learn that Ive only been to one other wedding. Its actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
  I hate you!
 Long story short Jeffs dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said boo.
 This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies man, arent you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I cant believe Im actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Lets do it.
  Thats ok.
 This is bull****!
 Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
 I cant believe I pushed that... that guys lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. Thats... well... I got news for you, Albert. If thats your real name. The shows not over.
 Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
 Oh, shiii...
 Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! Thats what Im talking about!
 Congratulations, Bob. Youre a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
 Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
 Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
 Im already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
 I will take care of that.
 I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
 Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, Im Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, Im going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Websters Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who dont know me, Im Michael Scott, Phyllis boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige...
 The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
 Phyllis and Bob their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and shes kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was Easy Rider. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
 is a guy that...
 he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didnt say anything when Phyllis dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
 No. Im not going to...
 Ok. All right.
 Oh. Yeah. Youre out of here! Youre... Yeah. I hate you!
 Come... Come on!
 Dwight, just...
 Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. Im not even going to dance one song.
 OK.
  ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
 I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
 We are great together. We are a great team.
 Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I dont want this to ruin her honeymoon.
 Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
 Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. Im sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
 Yeah. Yeah. Hes kind of a weirdo.
 Youre... Youre welcome.
 They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say thats crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
 Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
 Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
 Huh?
 Pop quiz.
 Why is today a special day?
 Todays a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
 In business school, Kevin. Business school.
 A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
 Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing Ive ever said to you?
 Will they throw their hats, you think?
 A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
 Yeah, I know, I know. Im just saying if they did throw their hats Ive got a great line for that "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
 I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes youre such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
 We have fun.
 Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
 Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
 I cant hear what hes saying, but he looks like hes really into it.
 Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someones textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think youre inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
 So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?
 Okay, Im seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
 ...And products!
 Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
 We cant overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
 ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee youll come back.
 ...We dont want them back, cause theyre... stupid.
 Nice try, hows your Pollack-says-what index?
 Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
 ...Wait, Ryan said that?
 Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
 David will always beat Goliath.
 Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what were learning in business school?
 Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Cant you understand that? No, you cant. Youre too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks hes a tease. Well you know what? He doesnt know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!
 Business is always personal. Its the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
 You heard me, pack your things.
 Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
 A good manager doesnt fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
 Pam-casso! Sorry Im late, I had to race across town.
 Wow! You did these... freehand?
 My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
 I dont see a... price.
 Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, theres my... window, and theres my car! That your car?
 That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
 What?
 ...Chunky. Do you want half?
 Okay.
 It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
 Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
 And now, the chains.
 A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And thats why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. Its um, its really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
 MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I dont see how he can.
 No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
 I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
 No. Alright, this is getting hot. So lets just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
 AHHHH!
 Yes.
 I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magicians code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
 Alright.
 Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
 Pam, would you smell my breath?
 "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my bosss bosss boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So its kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
 Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
 Sure? Might be a good idea.
 Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
 Play some games?
 I spy?
 Oh, sure. Really didnt give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you.
 Hey, Buttercup.
 I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
 Thats what she said.
 Uh, yes you are.
 No problem.
 Ok.
 Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
 Ummm... I dont know.
 Maybe.
 Ok.
 Alright. Bye.
 Beauty. Thank you sir!
 Thank you.
 Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
 I dont care. Oh, wow. Here. Dont put my jacket. Dont give me that.
 Yes.
 Ok.
 Hi.
 Actually, its polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
 Oh, um, potato salad.
 No, its not.
 Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
 Its been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
 What are you looking for? You bring dip?
 Awesome. Im going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
 Over our love.
 You dont have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
 Its a heart.
 I love this woman!
 Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. Its weird. So...
 Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
 Ok.
 It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
 Yeah, but youre great now, right? Were all great. Arent we great?
 I could go for an appeteaser.
 Bagel bites or something.
 Dwight, wow. Thats not appropriate.
 David, how much did this house cost?
 Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.
 Yeah. Do you have any ice?
 How about some Splenda?
 This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
 You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
 Oh yeah, they dont allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But its fun. Its an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
 Crazy.
 Ok. Excuse me. Whats going on? What is it?
 What are you doing?
 Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
 What has gotten into you?
 No, no, no.
 Come on, lets go back to the party.
 Dont take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
 No, no, no, means please dont. Please.
 Im not going to slam you up against the wall.
 Youre acting inappropriate. Jan.
 Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. Its funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. Its just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
 Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
 You didnt have any of the potato salad did you?
 Well, if thats the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
 Im not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why dont you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
 I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
 Whatever.
 Thats all, you didnt mean it?
 I love you, Jan.
 No need for consternation, everything is under control.
 It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
 No...
 No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and hes just using this Roy thing as leverage.
 Yeppers.
 I dont... remember.
 Yeesh...
 Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
 Wikipedia.
 Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
 Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
 Hmm, well thats interesting Darryl.  I think...  that maybe you should...
 What Im saying is that,
 Ok, see what I did?
 By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
 Ok, lets try another one.  Um...
 Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
 Its a surprise.
 Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
||
 What?
 No, what did you say?
 Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
  Yeah.
 Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
 You know what?  Actually, lets go into the conference room.
 No, you know what?  Lets stay here.  No lets go... Yeah lets go to the conference room.
 Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws em off.
 Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
  I am declining to speak first.
 Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just dont think corporate is going to go for this right now.
 What?
 No, this is a power suit.
  I do not buy womans clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
 Ohh... kay.
 All right.
 Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a womans suit?
 No, I do, I, I wear mens suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
 There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I dont think that this is totally just a womans suit.  At the very least its bisexual.
 Uh,  MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... thats the mystery.
 Okay.
 Would you stop it, please?
 Its European, OK?  Its a European cut.
 No, they dont.  See?
 Italians dont wear pockets.
 No, I dont want to do that because Im twice your size anyway.
 Um, lets just do this in 15 minutes.
 Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the drivers seat.  And make one tiny mistake, youre dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore womans clothes.
 Lets get down to business.  Why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
||
  That was a very good point.
  You make a very compelling argument.
 I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
 Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
 Oh.  Come on.  Be serious.
 I... I cant give you that, I--- I dont make this much.
 I dont.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
 Plus perks, yes.
 Fourteen years.
 No, please, please...
 Ok, lets take 15, again.
 A bosss salary isnt just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Cant put a price tag on that.
 Oh, thank you.
 I didnt give you $40.
 Okay.  Okay, heres the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
 I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
 Well what am I supposed to do?
 Im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
  Thats true.
 You know what?  I should.
 I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
 You know what?  I deserve a bump.
 I am makin it happen, sergeant.
 No, Jan.  Ive never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
 Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  Ill leave right away.
 Yes, Im bringing Darryl.
 Mm-hm.
 Hey, Id rather kill myself.
  No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being Ive ever known.
  Fine.
 Toby, come on.  Lets go.
 Where?  Im gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, lets go.
 Yeah.  Fine.
  Dont ever touch a black mans radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
 Well...
 Mm, the Big Apple.
 Maybe Ill stay.
 Well...
  Oh, I...
 Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
 All right.
 Whos the boy toy?
 Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
 Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
 Pippity poppity.
 Six percent?  After all weve been through?
 I got you... jade earrings.
 No!
 No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex.   What are you writing, perv-ball?
 Why dont you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
 Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  Im not going anywhere.
 Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
 Well thats ridiculous Im not gonna make---
 Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Heres the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
 But you just said 15.
 Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  Its about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
 Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryls presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
  "Hey Darryl, hows it hangin?!"
 Bailer?  I hardly know her.
 Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
 Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
 Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  Thats like... a half an hour, every hour?
 Ok, you know what?  Youre making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
 Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.    Sorry, he is very lame.   Um, lets see.  "Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
 Ok guys, you know what?  I didnt--- I didnt interrupt when you were having your presentation.
 Yes.  Okay, lets do another one.  This is a good one.  "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
 Yes.  "Which can contribute to heart disease."  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
 Mmmm, no, no, its... sedentary...
 No.
 Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
 Okay.  ... What, Nerf isnt cool anymore?
 Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Mens Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  Id like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  "Hello, Im Michael.  Welcome to Mens Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example.
 Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
 Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
 I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
 Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You dont go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
 Indubitably.
 They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
 I dont know, I dont know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
 Nn--- Depression.
 Yes.
 You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?"  Well, I thought Id bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Heres the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, were going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, wheres Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, "Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?"  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."  But thats... not why Im doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin-da!
 Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
 Go buy some watermelons.
 Just...
 Lets do it!  Drop that sucker.
 BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
 Find out whose car that is.  If its Stanleys, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
 Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
 Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
 Yes, thank you for seeing that.
 I dont know if I wanna do this.
 No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, were not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
 Rock n roll!
 Thats right!  I am not thinking.
 Yes!  Yeah!
 Woo!
 Woo!
 I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point!
  My life!  Oh, my life...
 Everythings wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
 Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
 Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
 Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
 Okay... thats...
 Thats the whole point, dummy.
 Okay.
 Oooooh, my life!
 Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
 Dwight, you ignorant slut.
 And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
 What is it?
 Dwight, find out what the present is.
 Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
 You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
 What do I have to live for?
 Its complicated with Jan.  And I dont know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isnt nearly as good as it used to be.
 An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  Thats the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really cant say.  But, yes.
  It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, were going to recalling all of that paper.
 We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  Ive never been a fan.
 Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
 Crisis Management Squad.
 Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
 To save time, Jim.
 You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
 Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
 We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
||
 Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
 No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
 I want you to bring a partner.
 No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone whos actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
 No, no.  I need two men on this.  Thats what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
 No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
 Heres the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  Thats what happened to O.J.
 I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
||
 OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
 Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though shes a pretty unimportant client, really.
 And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
 So, let us consider this matter ended.
 I know, I know youre angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
 Well, we are extremely sorry.
 We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
 The watermark... its a one time thing.
 OK...
 What... can I do, for you?
 Well...  OK, well...  Um, wasnt really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
 The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
||
 No, Im a regional manager---
 No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
 Thats insane.  Well give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
 Doesnt matter.  Out please!
 Yeah, well Im calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?
 We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
 No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
 Youre right.  It will blow over.  But its not... going to take... a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?
  OK, I think thats good.
 "Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."
 Thats how devoted I am to this job.
 I know.
 I understand that, Dwight.
 Do you think youre taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now were wasting tape.  Im gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
 So Ill know where---
 Im asking Pam to do it, please.
 OK, ready?
 Five, four, three.  "There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldnt be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Lets not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasnt me.  Theyre trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day."
 Thats... they always give an ultimatum.
 Good, cut?
 Thought so too.
 Whats happening?
 Really? Is she OK?
 OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.
 Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
  Im sorry. Its pretty funny when you think about it.
 Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  Hes back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!
 What? Oh.
 Oh, Phyllis got flashed. Its, uh...
 Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but shes not even here, so no harm, no foul.
 Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe youre the flasher.
 Uh-huh. Prove it. Lets see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
 In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women cant have fun if they dont feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didnt hear me.
 Huh?
 I dont know. I feel... I drive a lot. Im spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
 Um, that... I dont know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
 I... uh, well, I dont know.
  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that cant happen. Not in my house.
 OK.
 This is the last
 Dwight, are those your pants? Thats a Polaroid.
 Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
 OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why dont you just take these women, put em in a burlap sack, and hit em with a stick? Because thats what youre doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
 See? Thats what were talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
 No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? Thats it. Conference room, five minutes. Womens appreciation.
 Oh, I dont know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
 That is not current.
 You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
 I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
 Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
 OK, no catfights. Please. Lets - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
 What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones arent really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesnt care. Society sucks. I dont even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
 Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
 No. Im being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
 Yes.
 Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
 I have to know whether youre serious or not.
 Ye - OK, yes.
 Youre right. Youre right, youre right. And you know why? Its because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where were gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
 OK, lets go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Lets go!
  I dont think shes gonna make it. Dont think shes gonna make it -
 Many women
 All right. Hope nobodys on a diet.
 Youre welcome. Youre welcome, youre welcome. OK. So, lets dish.
 Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
 What, um... what do you think of role-play?
 Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
 I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
 Jan says anything that doesnt scare us is not worth doing. I dont know. Maybe were different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
 No, its not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
 No, shes... shes fooling around. Its a woman thing.
 No... No, its all right. Im OK. Im OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?
 OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
 Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. Im unhappy when Im with her. Flat-chested.
 Shes totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
 Im unhappy when Im with her.
 Im happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
 Yeah, thats smart.
 That sounds good too. I dont know whos right. I just dont - I dont know. I dont know.
 I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
 Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
 Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.
 Lets face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. Theyre caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
 Mm. You dont want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
 Oh. Oh, no.   Its Jan. What do I do?
 OK, it stopped.
 Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
 Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Lets see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.
 Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
 Uh... you know what? Im going to... you take care of that. Im gonna do traffic... detail.
 OK, I am really going to do this.
 You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Lets do this. Lets do it.
 I love you guys.  Now Im getting her voicemail.
  Hey, Jan. Its me, Michael. Im just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so Ill talk to you later.
 Thank you.
 Abso-fruit-ly.
 No... No...
 Yeah.
 Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, its not me, its you. OK, buddy."
  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Theres a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
 Ughh... Blech.
 Just... all over. I dont want to do anything... Im dying...
 Right there.
 Maybe.
 Not it. I dont have eggs.
 Thats possible.
 Uh-huh?
 The CFO? Ohh...
 OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
 To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
 And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
 Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jans heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
 ...you just gots to get your freak on.
 Yeah.
 Hmmm.
 Really?
 Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
 May God guide you in your quest.
 OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
 Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
 Well, you cant swim in leather pants.  Im just yankin your chain.  Not literally.
 Oh, you know what? Uh, youre not going.
 Yeah, I know. Im sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
 I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then itll suck.
 Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
 We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about peoples character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
 What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. Its like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
 I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
 This way to the partay bus.
 Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
 If you dont like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
 Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
 Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasms turning people off.
 Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
 Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just dont...
 Well write it down before you forget it. Thats... Youve just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I cant stay mad at you.
 Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!
 Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. Americas eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
 Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
 Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
 Jim Halpert. Pros smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
 Im not playing.
 Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
 We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
 Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
 Then I will name your team the Red team.
 I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
 Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
 Andy Bernard. Pros Hes classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons I dont really trust him.
 It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
 Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
  Pam...youre missing things.
 Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
 Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so its not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest Im going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
 Like umm... ten minutes?
 Thanks a bunch.
 A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
 OK, whos hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
 No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
 Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Lets just... OK, its very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
 No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so itll slide down your gullet more easily.
 Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
 I cant say.
 The winner gets a regional managers salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
 The winner of today gets my job. Ok? Im interviewing for a job at corporate. And theyre only interviewing a handful of people and Im the most qualified and Ill probably get it. Alright?
 I didnt want to tell anyway. I didnt want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I dont know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
  Word.  There we go. Lets see it.
 Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
 13 hot dogs, everybody!
 Its very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
 Probably left them in the trunk of my car. Its alright.  Its alright. Here we go.
 Aaaaaand, go!
 Nice, Stanley!
 One. Two. Three.
 Excellent!
 I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... whos ahead in points?
 Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
 Please just check.
 What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
 Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
 Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
 No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
 Pointless.
 Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, youre up.
 Ji.. why not? Cmon.
 You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
 Whos next? Andy? Wheres Andy? Andy is never here today.
 Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
 Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
 Yes. Count to three, please.
 Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
 Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
 Okay.
 Dont, dont.
 Im not going to give it to you.
 Being the boss is also about image.  Ive never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I dont see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire."
 Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I dont want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
 God! Hes a comedian.
 Whos Amanda Bynes?
 Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
 You are being too modest.
 Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
 That is a very, very funny story.
 Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
 WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
  David!
 Are we all set?
 Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought Id drop in and say hello.
 Thought Id catch a show.
 Naaah. You know what? Since Im here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
 Um, how many people are you interviewing?
 Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
 Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
 Ah, great. No further questions.
 Okay.
 And Im really looking forward to working with you.
 I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. Ill be like three hours late.
  Yeah.
 Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
 Okay. Uh...
 Uh, okay.
 Stop crying.
 Ohhhhh...
 Why so you can do it?
 No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
 Moon each other.
 All right.
 Your loss.
 Cruise control.
 There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
 No. Not at all. I havent talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
 No, no, no. You know what? Its a done deal. I basically have the job already. Theres nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
 Yes, I...
 I have to buy another place.
 I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
 Who is D. Abramson?
 Why... are you here?
 Im good. How are you, Janet? Its good to see you.
 Why privately?
 Okay, sure, fine. Um, why dont you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
 Okay.
 Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
 Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
 No. Shes an alternate.
 So, how you been?
 Good.
 Yeah.
 Weird. Yeah, I didnt get both of your messages.
 Hmm.
 Sound good. Sounds fun.
 Hmm..
 Would you excuse me for a second?
 Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
 I dont know, thats why youre here, help me. Please...
 No, no. What do I do?
 What if she makes me?
 She made me do a lot of things I didnt wanna do.
 I wasnt.
 Youre right. Youre absolutely right. Im gonna go in there and tell her that we cant be together.
 Wow.
 Im in a very good place right now. Thank you.
  Okay.  Jan, we need to talk.
 Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
 Yeah.
 First got priorities.
 Lets get back together.
 No.  No, no, no, no.  Ill tell you this, it is
  Remarkable.
 Wait, wait. Check one more time.
 Very good
 Yes, indeed.
 So, I guess were getting back together.
 Your advice was good, but Jans was bigger.
 Heres the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didnt connect, I was miserable. Now, Im in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
 Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, Ill be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,   I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
  How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
 I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybodys names.  If you need to know somebodys name, just ask me.
||
 I am by far the most qualified person theyre interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  Theyre like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
  Hey!  Hunter!  Whas up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
 Jan in yet?
 Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
 Just say, "I want to squeeze them."  Its code.  Shell know what it means.
 Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
  Hello, hello!
 Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
 Why dont I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
 Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
 Thank you.
 Ive never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  Were GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"  I dont know, could be good.  Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper.  Its super duper."  I dont know, something like that.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 It is always a treat when
 Hey.
 Pretty good.
 Could have gone better I guess.
 Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
 Daaah, lets just run away together.  Lets just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  Wed have fun.
 I cant tell you.
 So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
 Good, Im glad were on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
 You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I dont think I could take... my girlfriends job.  Thats not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
 Good.  Very good.  Im glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
 Good.  Thats all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
  Ill be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
 No.  No, Pam.  Im baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
 Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  "Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in."  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
 Thats stupid.
 You shouldnt have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing Im baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.
 No, its for me, bimbo.  Kids.
 So Im back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
  Back to work.  Still waitin on that coffee.
 Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. Its soy.  This is why I do it, thats what I have to come home to.  She probably wont be up for a few hours.
 This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin the sales team. I feel very blessed.
 Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
 It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
 Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
 Yeah.
 Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
 Yeah, its only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
 It was an accident.
 No.
 My lord my liege.
 So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
 So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
 Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
 No, I was being negligent. But shes in the hospital, shes fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
 Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
 Oh, right, Im sorry. What is we are fine?
 Ok, I have an announcement.
 No.
 No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look Im just trying to take everybodys mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
 So, like a freedom tree.
 Pam.
 Pam.
 Ok, good good, so well just all go down there together at lunch.
 Excellent!
 Good work Pam.
 Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
 Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
 Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I dont know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally Ill hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, dont sue me. That is the opposite of the point that Im trying to make.
 Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
 No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
 No... Shes in a coma.
 OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
 Yeah.
 Brought you some balloons. Why dont we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For Gods sake!
 Nurse.
  I am going to be sick... Im gonna puke.
 Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
 Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
 Well, just shhhh... just just...
 Look, I just... I dont understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
 Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
 Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But its not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
 OK, you know what? Everybody, lets just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so lets just...
 Sprinkles?
  Oh, sh... Im sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, thats 3 things. Ill tell you whats going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
 Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. Im not superstitious, but... Im... I am a little-stitious.
 Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
 Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
 Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
 Dwight, you havent seen Meredith yet, have you?
 Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
 Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
 Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
 Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright lets just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
 OK.
 Alright.
 Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
 Are you sure?
 What are you?
 OK, 1 Sikh, and...
 You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And its not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesnt make any sense... God is dead.
 Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe theres some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
 Oh God, Rabies?
 I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
 This place is so cursed.
  I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Merediths life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
 Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
 Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus dad?
 Pro-Am.
 A woman shouldnt have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why Im hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
 Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
 Come on man, gotta step it up! Its for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
 That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, hows the rabies quilt coming?
 Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
 Yes.
 OK.
 Alright, alright.
 Shhh...
 I know that youre probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
 OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
 Well, youre going to have to run, or youre going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
 We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
 Hmm... Thats a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
 Yep.
 You didnt contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And hows that been going?
 What about a rabies nurse?
 Thats possible. Look into that.
 Have you met that kid? Hes not going to college.
 Come in.
 Hey, hey, hey
 What are you doing?
 No I didnt, just please dont...
 May I enter the room?
 See how I did that. Thats the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
 Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
 European offices are naked all the time.
 Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
 Thats not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam youre an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I dont want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, its not fair to people with rabies. And thats the point, right? OK, lets go have some fun.
 Check that out.  Look at me, Im Toby, Im stretching, I know what Im doing. Why is he even here?
 OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And Id like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
 No, dont give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
 Hes happy because hes insane. You know what, thats the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Wheres the nurse?  This is the reason were here.
 Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
 Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
 You got it?
 OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
 Just remember folks, its not about winning, it is about finishing.
  Beow!
 On your left!
 I am fast! Im very fast! Im like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
 No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
 Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
 That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
  Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
  Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. Im getting a stitch.
  Take bat bites seriously. Dont get bit.
  I am not going to finish. I cant beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.
 I cant finish. I feel so weak, I just...
 What do you want me to do Jim?
 No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. Theyre deformed, and theyre abnormal, and... theyre illiterate and ugly. Symphonies dont have any money. Public TV is bust. I cant do anything about it, I cant... you know. Theres just one of me, and theres a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
 Thats a good deal.
 Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
 You just dont think I am capable, of making a difference.
 You dont, you dont know me. Youve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, Im the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!
 Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. Thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And Im very, very proud of that.
 Hey Mer. How ya doing?
 Its ironic isnt it? I mean Im in the hospital for not getting enough water, and youre in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
 Thanks, Im not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?
 Im not really sick.  Nah, Im good.
 Hey Toby. Whats this?
  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
 Oh really.
 Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think. I dont think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I dont think its any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
  No way.
 Woooah! Wow!
 Awesome!
 You guys! Yes! Yes!
 Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
 I love you guys, so much.
 No, no, no Pam let em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
 Hey. Can you make that straighter? Thats what she said.
 No.
 Blowing up balloons I thought.
 Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
 Hey!
 There he is! There he is! Hes back! And hes with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. Im Tubs.
 Ohh, yeah, lets get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
 ...business meeting --
 Thats right! Thats right!
 Fire guy. Dont start any fires, Ryan.
 Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. Youre like our little man...
 Beard.
 Oh, wow!
 Thats a little kinky. I dont swing that way.
 Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
 Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Lets get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
 Sounds good. OK, alright.
 Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, were friends. Im doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And well always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
 OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
 Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.
 Who is?
 I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
 Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
 Yeah, I know I understand... were making great strides and were updating, but business as usual, no?
 Good, so, were on the same page?
 We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And thats who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
 Hey.
  Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
 I dont want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
 Oh, I dunno, theyre launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. Hes being a real twerp about it, so, its all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
 Well...
 What is that... word?
 So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
 Good, were all here, we can get started.
 Have a seat.
 Have a seat. Like everybody else.
 Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
 Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
 No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "wheres the Beef?"   Yeah.
 I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Whos this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
 Sure thing.  Scuse me.
 Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
 Bob, how old are you?
 Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
 Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
 Wow.
 Oh, boy.
 Great.
 Great.
 Thats great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
 Perfect.
 Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks, because its illegal, and you will go to jail.
 No, No. Dont help him. He doesnt need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
 Good night guys.
 I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
 I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
 Smell that. Do you smell that?
 No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
 Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. Ill explain, later.
 Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IMs, but I think hes forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
 Hey boss, I didnt know you were coming in today.
 I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
 With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? Thats what people like.
 Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I cant do things. "You cant be on the team", "You cant move on to second grade". Well, now theyre telling me that I cant win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  Well see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
 OK. Were gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
 Why dont we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
 Yes?
 OK, thats not helpful Phyllis.
 Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
 Fine, Im just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
 No, this is my quest.
 Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
 We dont need luck.
 But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
 Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
 It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
 I know. So whos next?
 Who?
  Wow, those things are heavy! Theres a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
 Yes we do.
 Well...
 Mmhmm.
 OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
 Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
 Alright.
  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
 That is true.
 Yes, she is nuts.
 How do they know? How does this know where to turn? Thats very impressive.
 And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
 Ah, well its still very good. I bet I know someone who hasnt heard that joke... your daughter Emily. Hows she doing?
 Shes gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I dont want to take any more of your time, I know youre a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
 OK, OK! So youll reconsider?
 Ah... .is that all you have to say?
 Look, we want you back.
 Well, no.
 No its not.
 Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because youre definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
 Look... were also coming out with a website soon. Its a state of the art thing, itll be up and running, its gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
 Great, the magic of the gift basket.
 OK, good. Dont let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, shes alergic.
 I dont get it, I really dont get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
 That is a very good point, Dwight.
 No, it said right, it said take a right.
 Maybe its a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
 The machine knows where it is going!
 The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
 Let go, let go of me!
  You sure youre OK?
 Good, that is whats most important.
 What a disaster, this whole thing.
 These people just dont realize what a gift basket means, they dont get it.
 What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I dont even know if I want it. Theyre website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
 Hang up.  You know what were gonna do? Were walking back. Were walking back to that office and were gonna reclaim our gift basket!
 Were gonna take whats rightfully ours! Were gonna take a stand, Dwight! Were gonna take a stand!
 Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
 Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, lets leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
 Look, my clothes are so wet!
 Its been opened.
 Whats missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
 WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
 May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
 Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
 I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology, and look where it got me.
 Exactly!
 Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
 Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
 Hey Toby. Whats this?
  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
 Oh really.
 Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I dont think.

 Bob, how old are you?
 Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
 Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
 Wow.
 Oh, boy.
 Great.
 Great.
 Thats great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?

 Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
 And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  Theyre just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesnt have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
  We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
  Yeah!  I know.  I know.  Its bland.
 Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
 Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a "Wheres Waldo."
  Alright. Alright.  Lets quit while were ahead.
  That was awesome. Thank you.
  Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
  Oh, does he?
  Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
  And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
  Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York Citys finest, and I do not mean policemen...
  The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 600 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
  No.  It doesnt.  Ill find out tonight.
  Whats that, pipsqueak?
 Ohh, lunch party.
 Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
  Okay.
  Really?
 Its the European cut.
  Umm... hey.  Ah, whats hanging?
  Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
  I had um, one of those danishes.
  Why dont you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  Itll be fun.
  Just...
  Yeah.
  Thank you.
  Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think Im a big loser.
  Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
  Im sorry. Im sorry.  Its just the first... girl that popped into my head.  Ill find somebody I havent slept with.
  So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
  Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
  Just let me know who the winner is.
  Alright.  Im ready to go and Im callin shotgun.
  Yes.  Thank you.
  Oh yeah, youd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I love ya Pam... okay.    Im leavin inside Jims car, I dont know when Ill be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow Ill be back.  Ill be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why dont you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
  If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
  You ever read this?
  Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places Youll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
  Same sort of stuff in here.
  Mmwa.  Mmwa.
  Leaving Pennsylvania.
  One for me one for Jan.
  You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  Thatd be fun.  Friday?
  Wanna come over Friday?
  After work you guys...
  Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  Its a club called Chatroom, and theres a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
  What are you doing?
  No.
  No, Im sure thats not.  Na...
  Yes.
  Well the invitation says VIPs only.  Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?  Were already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay Im going to throw up.  Im throwing up.  Youre making me throw up, Ryan.
  You know what this is like?  Ill tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldnt let any of the Seniors go.
  Doesnt it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
  Yeah.  I withdrew too.
  Alright who wants to party?
  Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
  I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
  Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party youve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybodys gonna come.  Whats wrong with Dwight?
  Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela Id like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
  This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasnt as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, Im not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
  How we doing on time?
  Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
  Mmmhmm.
  Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
  I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
  Yes
  Uh...
  I want it...
  I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
  Yes you can.
  Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldnt say that if I didnt hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
  No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we dont have a lot of time.  Ill get the pizza!
 Good news.
 Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
 Same thing.
 You know what?  I dont understand when you all talk at the same time.
 Pizza by Alfredo.
 Okay, okay, whats better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
||
 Yup.
 You dont have to say it like that.
 Hey
 Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
 Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
 You didnt actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
 Okay, it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon, and if its policy, it should say it on the coupon.
  What do you mean hmm-um?
 It is your problem.  Thats no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
 Im not giving that to you.
  No, no youre not going anywhere.  Youre staying here until we figure this out.
 You know what?  This young man needs to learn thats not how you treat people.  I dont care if its pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You dont just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
 Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
 No, you dont even know what stupid is.  Its about to get all stupid up in here.
 You ready to give me my discount now?
 Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
 Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
 No!  Im an adult, I dont have to think or do anything.  Youre a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks hes better than everyone else, because hes some hot shot, and you dont know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
 Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked thats called sales.
 Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
 Stop talking all at once!
 Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
 You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
 Im not kidnapping him, Im keeping him until I get what I want.
 I think youre over-thinking it.
 Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that Im keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
 Trouble.  Okay, alright.
 He said no.
 No, no.
 Mister Overdramatic, whats up Kevin?
 Ill just wave and introduce myself.
 Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
 Hey, have you seen Jim?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
 Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
 I could have paid for the pizza.
 Oh my God, oh my God.
 This is Michael.
 Youre breaking up. I cant hear you.
  Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
 I will open the door.
 And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
 Yes.
 See ya, drive safely.
  Okay.
 Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
 Not now Dwight, please, its not the time.
 What a horrible day.
 Bluh.
 Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  Id really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
 Im going to get it.
 Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
 New York.  Wanna go?
 Alright, you drive.
 Here we go.
 Mmm.
 Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, lets go.
 Guilty.
 Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
 Yeah.
  Im Ryan, and tonight didnt go the way that I thought it would, because it didnt work out for me, and Im very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
 I never sold any paper, because Im an idiot.
 I made it with my cheese pita.
 I started a fire, I started a fire.
 And Im hot, Im so hot. Thats why everybody...
 Well, its part of it, its just the... uhhh.
 Wanna head back?
 Coat!
 Steak! Wheres my steeaaak?
 Get me Armani.
 On the phone.
 Wheres Armani? Hes on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. Im so much better than you are.
 I owe you an apology.
 Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Wont ruin it for you.
 Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want whats best for you, Mo Chuisle.
 I havent heard the same about you. So lets just go with mine.
 We already have a sofa. So why do---
 It... folds up. Youve only seen it flat.
 I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
 Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when Im sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. Im going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
 Its just that you say its gonna cost what it costs---
 Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
 Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
 Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
  Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
 Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
 Use to have two cars, traded em in, now were down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
 You can not, I have a thing tonight.
 What?
 Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
 How about this weekend?
 Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
 You wouldnt understand. Its a secret.
 Im sorry Mr. OBrian, I didnt mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it wont be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.
 I just love sales. I love it to death. Its as simple as that. And I dont get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
 Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
 No, theyre with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
 These meetings are useless.
 Very inspirational.
 Or a trained seal.
 Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
 Im just calling because you responded positively to the---
  ...Stanley?
  Senor, are you happy with your---
  Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
 Well your son sounds like hes really motivated. I think its crazy the coach wont play him frankly.
 You bet.
 Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
 It is not a waste of our time.
 Vikram doesnt have my people skills.
 Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
 What did you get tonight?
 Oh, that looks good.
 I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
 Thank you.
 Really?
 Wonder what I wouldve been back home?
 I know, but its competitive here. Whats a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
 I wouldve been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
 You know what, heres the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, hes just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But hes an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? Hes invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. Its not Terminator.
 I actually wrote a movie.
 Im writing one, yeah.
 Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
 Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
 Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin?
 Okay. Hows yoga?
 Wh-Why not?
 Okay.
 Good night Vikram.
 Hey, congrats on the bonus.
 Im gonna have it one of these nights.
 Good night.
 Um... that wasnt much of an introduction.
 Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today were gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
 Yes I forgot about Ryans presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
 And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, thats what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
 Why?
 No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
 My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
 What I do between 530 pm and 1 am is no ones business but mine and my other business.
 It wont.
 Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
 Why dont you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
 Huh, okay.
 Its whoever, not whomever.
 No, whomever is never actually right.
 Not a native speaker.
 Well it sounds right, but is it?
 Thank you.
 No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomevers name is Toby, why dont you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
 Ive never done this before. Ive never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
 Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
 And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
 In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I cant do this.
 I am.
 I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
 Hey Kevin, youre a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
 Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I dont know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like hes tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
 Do you know anybody in the mob?
 Okay, um, Oscar, Im going to need to take another advance on my salary.
 Hey guys.
 Whatcha talking about?    Okay, I know whats going on.  Youre talking about Jim and Pam, if theyre having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
 Hey, hey, hey.
 Monkey problem? No, Im not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
 Oh, I hate monkeys.
 I dont have a second job.  Maybe Im having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
 I dont talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
 I totally agree with you.  But I dont have money problems, I dont.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?
 Yeah, but I destroyed it, its not even useable anymore.
 No you didnt.
 How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
 That is a good point.
 Like the witness protection program.
 Ive always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  Ive already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  Im a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  Thats the life.
 I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
 I didnt say it, I declared it.
 Yeah, tell me about it.
 You know, Jan has my credit cards, and shes using them as if Im made of money, she thinks Im a human ATM machine.
 Oh, thats the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
 That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think thats how they got a core.
 Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
 Right.
 How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
 No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
 We will find another way, well ask power-point.
 Youre a presentation tool if you think Im gonna tell Jan about this.
 No youre not! Ok, just... youre not a tool. Look, well tell her that its bad, but it couldve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
 She poses.
 Um, thats, how did you get that from what Oscars saying?
 What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. Im getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
  Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and Im never coming back.
 Hey Jan.
 Not much, whats up with you?
 Im out of answers Jan.
 I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
 I dont know that.
 Ill stay off the grid.
 Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
 Thats really nice of you to say.
 I think the engineer left.
 Dont sell your implants please.
 Thats nice though.
 It looks cute though.
 Yeah! Everything! Oh its all good, its all good. Phyllis!
 Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
 We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... its uh, not too shabby.
 Okay, its football cream. Its football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
 Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
 Hello hello!
 Michael Scott.
 Regional manager.
 Excited to talk ideas.
 You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
 All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
 I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The Nard Dog. Who let the Nard Dog out?
 He gives the best back rubs in the office.
 Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
 Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
 These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
 Who else?
  Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that shes in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the worlds largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the worlds largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
 Actually I dont get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
 Yeah, I know.
 Mmm. Okay.
 Thats what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.
 Well we can do better than that.
 The waving?
  Shrek! Shrek, Im a donkey! Im a donkey, Shrek!  Im just kidding. Its me. Hello Ry.
 Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
 Yeah, well when I call about big problems you dont like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
 Im creative, Ryan.
 Well actually I cant cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mikes Cereal Shack. Im thinking well have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
 Yeah!
 Are you? I dont think youre doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
 All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldnt even talk yet.
 Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
  How about never hundred hours, sir.
 Hey thanks. Thank you.
 Yeah, Im glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
 Whats up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that its ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and well do it on my dime.
 Im willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
 Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
 Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "Youre not creative"?
 Well theyre wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
 We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So lets get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, Id like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
 Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
 Line it up Phyllis.
 Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
 Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. Ill make you a mix.
 Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
 No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I dont hate it, I just dont like it at all. And its terrible.
 Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
 No. I said I hate the, the style.
 Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
 Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we dont get this, if we dont nail it, were going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
 Thata girl.
 Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
 Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
 Im about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. Theyll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
 Pam, please clear my phone lines.
 They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.
  Well, its been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
 No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. Its not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
 That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
 This is perfect.
 This is a dummy, a la Ferris Buellers Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
 But, you will not tell anyone.
 Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.    Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  Were going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
 Just go out, and come back in.
 What?
 Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
 No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
 Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
 That could not possibly be it.
 You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I dont know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
 How can I get you to stay?
 Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why youre really leaving.
 Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
 Pssh, kay.
 Fillipellers, hows it hanging?
 To the left?
  To the right?
 Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
 Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
 No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but Im going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
 You can train him.  Hes very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I cant do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, Im going to poach one of yours.
 Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?
 Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
 Im going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because Im a genie in a bottle, and Im going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
  Get out.  Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess thats not as grabby.
 No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
 What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  Were like Animal House.
 Jim, were getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
 What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, thats what were going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
 Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and were going to crush this sale.  Were going to prove, what the hell is that music?
  Thats the problem, thats the problem.  We need rock n roll Pam, rock n roll.  Alright?  Oh... My... God, thats why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
 What? What? We did?
 Look at his face! Look at his face!
 What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
 We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what were doing.
 Uh-huh.
 Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
 We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
 In your face
 Are you calling Karen?
 Yep, get it.
 It had to be done, it had to be done.
 Hey Dwight, he found it.
 Alright, youre going to miss the best prank ever.
 Do you really wanna know?
 Follow me, come here.  Heres what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
 No, no, not real bombs.
 Uh, maybe, maybe, I dont know.
 It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
 Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
 So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
 I cant imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
 ...awesome.
 Okay, I will start.  Um, "A."  "A" my name is Alan, and my wifes name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
 Im trying to think of what we could sell.
 Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
 What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
 Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
 Ill kill you man!
 That is just so disgusting!
 Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
 Yeah, Dwight, heres how its going to go down.  You and I-
 You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
  We are in a stairwell.
 Theres a guy, theres a guy.
  Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
 We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
 Its enormous, but its got wheels.  Were wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
 Aha!
 Were wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
 Save yourself!
 Dwight, you gotta move!
 Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
 Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
 Just say you wanna get back together.
 It doesnt have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
  Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanleys head, we will burn Utica to the ground.
 We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, Im gonna need some help writing a want ad.
 Um, wanted middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart.  I cant do this.
 Of course.
 Really?
 Morning.
  Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
 Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real.
 So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
 Really?
 Oh, you wanna go today?
 How often can you actually donate blood?
 Your body only has a certain amount.
 Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
 A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making smores?
 Hello, Im Broken Mountain. You know, heres the thing. Thats not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
 In the wilderness. Its not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. Its one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
 I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
 Im sick of it Jim. Im sick of this place.
 When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
 OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
 OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what...
 Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
 Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
 No.
 Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
 Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
 Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
 This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
 When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
 This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
 Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
 Well...
 You...
 You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
 I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I cant retrace my steps. I dont know what streets weve been---  Ow! What are you doing?
 No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
 Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
  Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday!
 Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
 What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
 Stop.
 Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
 Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.
 Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.
  Day One. Im in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. Ive brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. Its hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 oclock in the afternoon. Its really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I dont hit my corroded artery here...
 There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
 Im going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
 See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things.
 Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
 I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. Im loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesnt even matter.
 Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
 I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldnt come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. Im startin to feel it a little bit. Ohh... Its Creeds birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
 Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. Ive made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
 Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are natures best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
 Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, dont do that. Youre gonna break something.
 Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didnt want to have to struggle to survive. I dont need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I dont need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I dont need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky.
 Hey, buddy.
 What up?
 You are relieved.
 So what did I miss?
 Oh.
 Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
 Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, youll figure it out.
 Thats what I said. Thats what she said.
 I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
 Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
 Ill call back.
  Yeah, um, tell him Ill call him back.
 You cant always work 200 days though.
  Oh, no, no, no, I dont have time for this. Tell him Im in a meeting.
 Yep.
 Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
 N-No, money isnt everything Ryan. And youre my friend, and I dont want to be rude.
 I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
 Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.
 Yeah, I hate that.
 So, heres the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jans wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
 Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. Thats how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? Im feeling a little queasy.
 Well-
 Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
 Yep. Tell them how much youre gonna get if you win.
 Million dollars!
 Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jans answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like its not memorized.
 Perfect crime.
 Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
 Im getting car sick! Ugh, Im gonna puke. I think Im gonna throw up.
 Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
 Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
 Hey hey.
 I would love that.
 Abso-fruitley. Yeah. Ill-Ill do anything for the company.
 It is.
 Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
 Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
 Never. I want him gone. I dont talk until he leaves.
 Okay. All right.
 Yessh.
 Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
 I havent actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
 Six years and two months.
 Thats what she said.
 Thats what she said.
 Uh, wh-why would she say that?
 Come again? Thats what she said? I dont know what youre talking about.
 Well, delivery is all wrong. Shes butchering it.
 She thought it had to do with the twins. Thats what I call them.
 Um, to be delicate, they hang off miladys chest. They... make milk.
 Yes.
 Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
 Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
 Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
 I will allow it.
 Uh...
 Uh-huh.
 Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, thats like six years ago. If its from the first time we kissed, thats like two years ago.
 If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
 Line.
 Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
 Irie.
 I dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
  Can I sit here?
 How can you give up my diary like that?
 Howd you even find it?
 I dont like lump. Im really upset about this.
 Fine. I love you.
 Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
 Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
 Thank you very much. You didnt have to say that.
 That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
 March 17th.
 Yes.
  "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
||
 How can you do that to me?
 Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
 See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
 ...Absolutely not.
 Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
  Hey, David?
 I think youre a nice guy too.
 Why did I do it? I dont know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
  What do you want to do for dinner?
 Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
 Do you fast food?
 Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
 Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, Im - God, Im so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we dont want to work. No we dont! Its not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! Were not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
 All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
 I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
 You said you didnt have plans. Thats what you said.
 Dwight, its couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
 Hello.
 Come on in. Good to see you.
 Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
 Yeah.
 Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
 Except driving.
 Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I dont know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
 Okay.
 Totally your call babe.
 Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
 Well, thats...
 Yep, never been used.
 No.
 This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
 As you can smell theres a lot of different odors going on in here.
 Bond.
 James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
 Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
 Well, I-
 Thanks, thats my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
 Its actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
 I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.
 Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
 No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
 If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
 Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
 Ill get it.
 Okay.
 Very nice.
 When in Rome.
 Whatever you say babe.
 All right.
 How bout a toast. Shall I? Heres to good friends.
 Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
 Yeah that sounds good.
 You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
 All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
 Yes, I was watching Jims face.
 And he was laughing.
 Look at him, hes laughing.
 Well you dont need two of you to do that.
 Thats true, thats a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
 All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
 All right, Okay, okay, youre getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
 No, Baah! But hes married to her!
 No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, Im gonna pass, Im gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
 Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
 No!
 God, does anybody read the paper?!
 Youre welcome.
 I dont like that story babe.
 Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, dont. I shouldnt say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
 Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! Im in hell! Aaahhh Im burning, help me!
  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jans candles.
 Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
 Im sorry.  What now?
 Dwight is my friend.
 You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didnt have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
 Whatever I want? Its never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
 When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasnt so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didnt want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
 Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
  Pam... I hope she didnt do anything to the food.
 I cant prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
 You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
 Excuse me for a second.
 Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
 Everybody enjoying their meal?
 Yeah?
 No. No. Im gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I dont think hes that good.
 BFD. Im a screenwriter.
 NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
 MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
 OH GOOD. ILL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
  THATS WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
 You know what guys, shell be out of the bathroom soon.
 Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
 Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
 Would she get into trouble?
 I will take the fall. I did it.
 Jim? Pam?
 No.
 Nope.
 Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
 Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, Im - God, Im so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we dont want to work.

 Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
 Yeah that sounds good.
 You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
 All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
 Yes, I was watching Jims face.
 And he was laughing.
 Look at him, hes laughing.
 Well you dont need two of you to do that.
 Thats true, thats a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
 All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
 All right, Okay, okay, youre getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
 No, Baah! But hes married to her!
 No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, Im gonna pass, Im gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
 Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
 No!
 God, does anybody read the paper?!
 Youre welcome.
 I dont like that story babe.
 Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, dont. I shouldnt say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
 Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! Im in hell! Aaahhh Im burning, help me!
  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jans candles.
 Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
 Im sorry.  What now?
 Dwight is my friend.
 You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didnt have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
 Whatever I want? Its never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
 When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasnt so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didnt want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
 Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
  Pam... I hope she didnt do anything to the food.
 I cant prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
 You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
 Excuse me for a second.
 Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
 Everybody enjoying their meal?
 Yeah?
 No. No. Im gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I dont think hes that good.
 BFD. Im a screenwriter.
 NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
 MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
 OH GOOD. ILL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
  THATS WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
 You know what guys, shell be out of the bathroom soon.
 Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
 Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
 Would she get into trouble?
 I will take the fall. I did it.
 Jim? Pam?
 No.
 Nope.
 Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
 Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, Im - God, Im so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we dont want to work. No we dont! Its not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! Were not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
 All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
 I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
 You said you didnt have plans. Thats what you said.
 Dwight, its couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
 Hello.
 Come on in. Good to see you.
 Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
 Yeah.
 Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
 Except driving.
 Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I dont know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
 Okay.
 Totally your call babe.
 Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
 Well, thats...
 Yep, never been used.
 No.
 This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
 As you can smell theres a lot of different odors going on in here.
 Bond.
 James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
 Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
 Well, I-
 Thanks, thats my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
 Its actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
 I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.
 Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
 No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
 If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
 Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
 Ill get it.
 Okay.
 Very nice.
 When in Rome.
 Whatever you say babe.
 All right.
 How bout a toast. Shall I? Heres to good friends.

  All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.
  This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
  Dwight, Dwight!
  No, I will ex-squeeze you.
  OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
  Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
  Jimbo.
  Did you see Hollys butt?
  Why?
  I know.
  I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that shes allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
  And that her butt refuses to quit!
   You have to agree with me.  Thats insane.
  I thought you had to pee.
   Hey, hey!  Pam, Pam! Hey!
   I wrote you a goodbye poem. Its really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
  No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
  I took a lot from other poems.
  All right, call--
  OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
 Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Lets move that up. Here we go.
  All right.
  All right!
   Im MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. Shes DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
  Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Whos your daddy? You dont know who your daddy is, do you? No, you dont.  Come on. Lets go in.
  No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Dont we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
  Pam, Id like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
  Oh, calm down, weirdo. Its just a joke. Shes such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She cant find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
  Lets go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
  OK, everybody, lets suck in our guts.
  Damn it. Come on.
  Here we go. Everybody on.
  Hows it going?
  Good.
  Cake? Who suggested cake?
  Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
  What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.
  Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
  No.
  Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we dont follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
  Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
  If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
  This is how were gonna do it. Five pounds. Im asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jims 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
  Booty call.
  Here.
  Wait a second.  I dont want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
  You want more?
   Its a pretty lame party.
  You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
  Lets go mini-golfing.
  Uh...
  Um, I think youll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
  You know what? Were pretty much done here today. Why dont you just take off early?
  Yeah.
  Good luck.
  Oh, Holly doesnt need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
  OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
  And what is that?
  You know, were gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
  Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.
  I did!
  Yes.  Gooooo-tee!
  Hey, you know what?  I cant do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
||
    Mmm--- mmm...  Um...
  Close the door.  This is your fault.
  Your stupid friend zone.
  I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
  Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.
  Gah, the dreadmill.
   Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
  I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! Ill take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
  Its my sumo suit.  I just didnt inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
  Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
  If its me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
  How do you know Michael Clump?
  How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
  No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why dont you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
  Hey!  Why dont you just sit down, please?
  Were doing this because of you.  So why dont you just go stand somewhere else.   Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
  Why?
  Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
  Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
  Youre right, youre right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
  Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why dont you have a seat?   Lets all clap at Phyllis.  Ok!    When Michael Clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.    Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go.  Ok, I want you to look at her.  Shes a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
  Ok, be more specific.
  What about her looks?
  Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
  I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.   Mmmmmm.
  Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
  Ahaha, Yep!
   Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
 Hey!
  Excellent!  Good job.
  Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?
  No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
  I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  Hell call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, hell call.  If he doesnt, he is loco.
  Ugh.
  Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
   Hey, is that healthy food?
  Were trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
  Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
  Aww, really?
  I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
  ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
  I know.  I love Counting Crows.
  Wow, really?
  Thats a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
  I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
  Ok?
  Alright.  Alright!    Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
  Is that good?
  OK.
  Darryl, would you do the honors?
  Nonono, no, no, I dont want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I dont care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
  Whats going on?
  To be married?
 WOO!  Alright!
 "Why are you helping her?  Youre not even dating."  Shes my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
 Ok, lets give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!
  Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, youre a good guy.
 Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
  Cant set em up like that.
 Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
 Yeah.
 Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
 Do you... just... youre kind of losing them.
  Lauren,  enough with the pencils.
 I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
 Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
 I will go first.  When I discovered
 To tell you or not.  And Im glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
 Yeah, .  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
 A siesta!
 You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
 Who hasnt?  Good.  Good!  What else?
 Mmm...
 Well, lets keep this party movin on.
 Bruuuuuuuuuce.
 Ach! Wuh---
 Thats crazy.  Thats crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got?  You know what?  Thats a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Whos to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, lets give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work.   Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
 Oh...
 Meredith, why dont you tell Holly... its not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
 No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
 Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  Its a miracle, youre at your desk.
 Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  Youll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and theres no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people cant, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
 Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
 Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.    Sorry!  You know what?  Lets go out!  Dunder Mifflins treat.  Um, actually youre not a client... so... well just split it?  Ethical.
 What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
 Istnt it?  Yeah, its kind of... business/romantic.  So youre from Des Moines?
 Wow, that sounds so... warm.
 Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
 Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  Its just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
 Wow, terminator, terminator.
 Yeah.
 I just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
 Ok, new idea.  We dont report it at all.  We just punish her.
 Mmhmm, tell her she cant have sex for six months.
 I dont know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
 No, its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
 I am just saying that I dont think that you understand what I am saying.
 Yes.
 Well... bleh busted.  I dont...
 Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
 I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I dont want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers.
 Whats the only thing worse than one HR rep?
 You get me.
 I dont know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
 Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
 How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so."  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like its a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
 Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
 Get in there right now or Im gonna lose it!
 Now is really not the time, Meredith.
 Yeah.
 OK, just remember to keep breathing.
 OK, good.
 Oh, OK! OK!
 I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
 I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
 I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
  Andy, would you like to have my baby?
 All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
 Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
 Aaaaaaaa!
 Just keep pushing...
 Im right here.
 Im right here, Im right here.
  All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
 Shhh. No, you cant have it.  Its too late.
 No.  You have to just push it out!
 Keep simulating.
 OK!
 Keep simulating.
 Yes, I do!
 OK.
 Yes.
 Aaaaaaaa!  Its coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
 Nice touch.  Good.  Lets try that again.
  It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
 Hello ladies, hows my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
 Damnit, Phyllis!  Im sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
 She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
 I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if Im not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, wheres my golden shower, Phyllis?
 It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. Its like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... its so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
  Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Dont talk to them.
 Make the party.  Dont - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
 Ahoy, matey.
 Ahoy. So, how you doin?
 Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  Its all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while shes here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And Im treating Ryan the same way.
 So this is Astird.
 Oh, OK.  Why didnt you call me?
 I could have helped.
 Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
 No, I dont!
 Can I hold her?
  All right, OK.
 I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think its because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst...
 ...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  Youre going to know them for the rest of your life.
  Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go.  Lion King!
 OK, come on, lets get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
  Im fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
 Ready to play some games? Lets do it!
 Uh, duh.
 No, the baby doesnt ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Lets just do what you were going to do.
 All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
 Whatta we got?
 Oh!
 She already has a stroller.
 OK, what else?
 Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
 I could have helped.
  Uh, yeah.
  I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
 Phyllis?  Could you take-.
 Hey guys.
 Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
 Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
 I just saw this baby daddy-
 Why, Darryl, because Im quote white quote unquote?
 Well-
 Its- thats different.
 Thats not a baby.
  Could I?
  I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
 Sure you cant stay a little longer?
 All right.  All right, everybody, were leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
 OK?
 Wha - thats, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, cause I dont, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
 All right.
  You wanna go out?
 I didnt feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
 Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
 Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
 Hey.
 That was really fun last night.
 Im actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
 Yeah?
 Oh really?
 Well...
 I, uh...  I let her win.
 So, when, um, can I see you again?
 No.
 Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonights no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
  Why?
 Wow... Oh, wait a second, I cant tonight...
 Tonights so...
 Too many times. Its all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
 Youre welcome.
 In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I dont know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me Ill know for sure.
 Yeah.
 Some of what we order depends on whether were having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think were going to have sex tonight?
 Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... Well just do the restaurant thing first.
 Probably get soup or something light.
 No. No. Reservations are at 800, so weve got like an hour and 45 minutes.   Im a crazy eight, Im crazy.
 Do you need em?
 All right.
 Thank vous.  What? Oh!
 Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they cant hear us at all.
 Were totally alone.
 Oh, my God, what happened?
 Yeah. Oh... oh!
 No, did you?
 Oh, no, my God.
 Oh my God!
 So much for sex without consequences.
 Were gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
 To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. Im calling it crime-aid. Its like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
 Thank you.
 Okay, Im gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didnt get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
 Okay. Okay! Well, come on, lets have an auction. Lets do this. Well auction off people like in the olden days.
 I dont know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. Theres a point there. But what is the point? I dont understand what hes saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, its not a little foggy theres actually something going on here-
 Do I?
 Yeah, I think thats pretty boss.
 Whoa!
 Twice. ... Right?
 Mm-hmm.
 Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.  And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.  Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? Youre auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
 Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars.  300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars.

What the hell is that?
 It squeaks when you bang it, thats what she said. Lets hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
 Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, Im actually going to bid on this. Im going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
 Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you dont win it. It just says "Creed."
 Lets hear an opening bid, everybody. Whos first? Kevin do your taxes. Hes the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
 Federal and State.
 Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
 We are getting there folks. Slow and steady.  Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
 Hey!
 100 dollars, great.
 Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
 160.
 Uh, just a few more items.
 All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.  All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
 No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and theyre gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
 Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
 Shes your wife, you idiot.
 Uh, what the hell is happening?

 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar.  Nicely done.
  Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. Its sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-
 Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cats Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
 When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
 Road trip!  Right?
 Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
 Were not.
 Were not doing anything.
 All right everybody. Im out of here. Jim, youre in charge.
 Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
 You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
 Cool!
 Were gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes well just meet in the middle. Itll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
 Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!   Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
 Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
 All right. Whats the scoop, how far?
 Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
 Yeah. I dont know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
 Here we go, fourth times a charm. "Lifes like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you dont, sometimes you do, what you want... theres a world out there....  Hey. Are you crying?
 Allergies?
 Did Darryl touch you?
 Whats the matter?
 Sure it is.
 Oh no no no.. Its gonna work, itll be fine.
 Listen to me. I like you so much.
 And Ive dated four women in the last--
 Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
 Ive dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
 Thats what she said.
 Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. Im gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
 Yeah.
 Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So were talking constantly all the way.
 Ill tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
 Maybe Ill see an accident one weekend?
 Years!
 Yeah.
 Heres my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
 My wish has come true, incidentally, because, youve met me, and you are happy.
 You know what? I think were a great couple. I think were a classic couple. I think were like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  Were like peanut butter and jelly, dont you think?
 Then dont do it. Please dont do this. Please dont do this.
 I dont know what Im gonna do!
 Please?
 Im not gonna be okay.
 No I wont! Im not strong! And Ill go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
 Oh thats mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
 You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, Ill just ride back with you.
 Ill be down in just a second.  Holly?
 So um... I think Im gonna go back with Darryl  Okay.  Goodbye.
 We didnt break up.
 Okay.
 Thats a really pretty song.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na.
 Da  na na na na!!
  Da  na na na na.
  Da  na na na na.
  Da  na na na na...
 Hey, sport.
 Ow! God!
 No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
 Yeah, so there you go.
 Oh, wow, so quickly.
 Nope. Nope. Not yet.
 Ill call her later.
 I dont want to do that.  All right.  She is going to freak out!
 Thats -- thanks.
 Mom, Im getting married.
 Why do you always do that? Whenever Im getting married, you dont believe me.
 No.
 Im not, Im not getting married. So...  Psych.
 And Im out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
 Ill take care of that for you.  Thanks.
 Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoors List. "Schindlers List" parody. ... Thats not appropriate, no.
 Alrighty, Dwighty, lets see how you did.
 No.
 Wow.
 Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
 A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Do I look like I am joking?
 If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
 Youre not.
 Jimbo, lets do this thang.
 Oh, come on.
 You too?
 Jim, they are a poopy.
 No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
 I agree.
 So lets see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
  Arrogance.
 And theres our smudgeness.
 Heres whats going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
 Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, youre going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Lets go.
  Ask him his name.
 Be respectful, Dwight.
 Its up to you to change his mind.
 Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
 Hes hard of -- hes an old man. Lets go.
 Stop it! Stop it!
 That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
 Here we go.
 Give me the phone.
 Give me the phone.
 Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
 Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
 Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
  See how its done?  Thank you very much, sir. I dont think youll regret it.  See what I did?
 Yes.
 ...  Its a million-dollar sale.
 Why dont you tell us?
 Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
 Whats going on?
  Kelly.
 You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Dont keep doing that. Ill give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
 Dont. Dont. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? Shes got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
 You were lying.
 Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
 I will call you when it is time.
 I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I cant tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I dont even know why I make it in such great quantities. Heres what were gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
 I think you should do that.
 Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
 I am jetting off on an international business trip.
 To Can-A-da.
 Canada.
 My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
 Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
 I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
 I have my passport.
  I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
 Well Ill just... Ill use different money for that.
 And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
  Well that is all in the past.
 They have one of those?
  Lets do this!
 Two are for souvenirs.
 I do. Its right here.
 No, I dont want to wear a bra.
 Stop it! Stop it!
 Okay.  Where is my translator?
 There he is.
 Yeah baby! Thats what Im talking about. That could be you  if you hadnt forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
 There we go. Our town car awaits.
 Its not just a van.
 Dwight, can you get those please?
  Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
 Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
 Take a sip of that.
 That good?
 Dont drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
 You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
 Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
 Yes...
 Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
  Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
 Shhhh! Keep it down.
 Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
  Hi.
 Um. Id like to see a menu please.
 Oh... okay.  Doesnt matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I cant see because I am in a--  GAH!
  This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
 Alright.
 Very cool.
 Okay.
 Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
 Wow!
 Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
 A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
 Guys, shes in there.
 Lets do this.
  Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
 Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
 Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
 ...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
 And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
 Shes foreign.  I am--
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you, Andy.
 Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think its better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that theres somebody out there that you love that youre not with.
 How about this one? Its Christmas eve---
 ---and everythings closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 1200 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
 Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
  Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
 Okay.
 Slept like a baby.
 Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings.
 Yes.
 Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
 No. Actually the trip sucked.
 The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
 I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
 And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
 It was not, it sucked.
 Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---
 That was a really good choice.
 No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
 That was a really sucky thing to do.
 Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think its because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  Thats respect.
 Oh brownies! Im taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
 Yeah why dont you send that to him in Costa Rica?
 Heh, okay, weirdo.
 She said she was going to give it to him right now.
 Yeah, they used to.
 Oh, can you imagine?
 Uhhgh.
 I dont know.  What?
 Hmmm, dare I?   You know what? Im going to, for old times sake.   Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.
 NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
  Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
 No.
 He looks worse.
 Uh, well Im afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
 Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
 Yes.
 I learned a while back that if I dont text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
 I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
 Thats true.  People say its icky.
 David, wait.
 Is there no way we can get rid of him?
 I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
 No.
 I dont.
  Dont do that.
 You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
 Youre welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
 So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
 Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
 Whyd you come back?  Why didnt you stay?
 I bet, for you.
  Shhh hot, why didnt you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
 Yeah, I am.  I am.
 I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like Im dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
 Okay, just summarize.
 Thats it, thats it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
 Mm.  Me too.  Okay, lets get this started.
 What are you doing?
 For what?
 No, no, no.
 Youre the bait for Toby?
 No, for one thing, hes not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
 Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
 Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
 Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. Im kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
 Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
 Good.  N-no no no, dont.
 Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
 Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
 Toby can I see those? Ooh.  Whats the matter?  Whats the matter? You scared?
 You mad? You mad at me?
 Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
 Huh?  He might do it...
 I dare you to.  Come on.
 Whats the matter... haaaww!
 Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, whos side are you on?
 No do it, do it.  I dare you.
 Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
 Son of a bitch.
  Just stop it.  You havent done anything helpful all day.
 Whats that?
 Frame him?
 Ive never framed a man before, have you?
 Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
 Hello.  Ive seen you guys around.  Im Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?   Uhghh, so I guess you know why Im here?  I need to purchase something.
 No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
 Grass, weed?
 I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
 Im not wearing a wire, so...
 How much? How many pounds is it?
 Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
 Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder whats going on.
 Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
 Yeah, lets just cancel this, okay?
 No, no no no... No, no.
 No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
 Oh God!
 No, no no no no.
 God! No, thats not... I dont know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
 Ahh, thats mine.
 Yes, its mine.
 Are you kidding me?  Thats my salad.
 You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
 Hmm.
 Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
 Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, thats who youre worried about?  Youre... youre worried about the cops time?  You think I framed you, and youre worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
 You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
 Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
 Do you want to hear a lie?
 I think youre great.  Youre my best friend.
 Mmm... okay.
 Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why dont you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
 Yes.
 Theres the x-ax...icks.
 Mmhmm, okay.
 Why dont you explain this to me like Im five.
 Ho-oh!
 Yeah.
 Ill be six.
 So the dollars a surplus. This is a surplus.
  Whoo.
 Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think Im getting you...
 Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?
 No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
 So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
 Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, lets just decide and agree upon one.
 Alright, so, teams forming.
 You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
 Yes.
 Why me?
 Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, Im going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
 Yes.
 I dont know. I havent decided yet.
 Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
 Yes.
 Ohh, God!
 Yeah!
 Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 All right! Cool!
 I have no idea.
  Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
 Yeah.
 Yeah?
 Oh, hey.
 I do.
 it was fun. We had a good time.
 Oh, thank you.
 Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
 You think thats good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
 Nine dollars. The boys department.
 Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
 Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
 Yes they were.
 They were.
 Mmhmm.
 Sits on a copier.
 Yeah.
 Very valid.
 All right.
 See ya.
  Hahaha!... well...
 Okay.
 Oh, thank you my dear.
 Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
 There he is! Hello, hello!
 Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
 Mm!  Yeah!
 Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
 Oh... ah, I almost choked.
 Hank, thank God youre here. The office is at a crossroads.
 Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
 Yes.
 Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
 Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, heres the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
 It is, yes.
 What?
 Okay.
 Oh, there we go.
 Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
 So, the copier.
 All right, yes.
 Well, what should I do?
 All right, get out. Get out.
 Hey David-  Im sorry. Im sorry. Im eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. Im stopping now.
 No, no, no, no, no. No. Im calling-  Im sorry.
 Mm. Im calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
 No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so Im not the bad guy.
 The what now?
 ...Like a tip?  $645?!
 I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
 All right, attention everyone.
 I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
 Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... its a good chair. I think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They dont have copiers. They dont even-  Gah! They dont even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
 Do I know what?
 Mm, no...
 $645.
 Right.
 Because that is how my mind works.
 Lets see...
 I dont need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
 This is so stupid.
 This is so, so stupid. And, God...  thats my phone.
 To be continued!
 No, I dont-this doesnt change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
  You think its easy?
 Okay, you know what? Why dont you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise Im taking the bonus. All right?
 It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put em in a room, and you just-  Hey.
 What?
 Good work. Im proud of you.  Mother-
  What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,  you should know that some people think its cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
 Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
 Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
 Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
 Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
 This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
  Alright... One more time around the block.
  Jim, Jim....
 That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
 Yeah.
 I know.
  Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadnt left India.
 Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
 No, no. I celebrate privately.
 Why dont we just do it now? Well do it quickly.
 Well do it quickly.
  What if we cant do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
 Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
 An intervention.  Its sort of hard to describe, but really its-- its a coming together... its a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.
 Okay, how do you feel?
 Uck... T.M.I.
  Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
 I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
 Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
 The ayes have it.
 Alright, well, lets look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
 Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
  Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
 Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
 I got it on a website, thats not important.
 Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  Im doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
 Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Heres what Id like to do.  Id like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  Ill begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  Thats how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Merediths drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we dont say anything shes not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.
  Thats-- you didnt-- you werent hurt by that.
 Okay, no, thats not what were going for.  Who has a problem with Merediths drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, dont you have anything?
 Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
 Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
 I want you to say Im an alcoholic.
 You can say it as loudly as you want, but were not going to believe you.
  Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and youre dead?
 Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
 Dwight--
 ...okay.
 Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  Its Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
 You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  Thats my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so Im not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
  Ill be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
 We did?
 Oh, shoot.  Oh well, well have to go someplace else then I guess.
 We could go there, sure.
 Yes, yes.
 I have a new place.
 It-- yep, recently.
 All right.
 Yeah, oh there you go.
 Thats good.
 Were party girls.
 Its okay. Its all right.
 Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
 Here we go. This is gonna be good.
 Yes you are.
 Shhh... just calm down.
  Come on. Shh...
 Heres the door. Heres the door.
  Lets start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
 I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
 So do I sign?
 As it turns out you cant just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.
  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
 No. No, no. There was wind.
 Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
 I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
 I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
 Go, Oscar. Thirty-ones my number.
 Beat it!
 Todays a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, Ill be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
 Wait, you still dont know...
 You still dont know.
  What are you doing?
 Andy.
  No, what Im saying is...
 No, thats not it.
  How can he still not know?
 I cant take it anymore.
 I am telling Andy.
 Who should it come from, then?
  Are you still having intercourse with her?
 Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
 Well?
 You know this cant go on.
 We have to put an end to this.
 Come on.
 When will she be ready?
 Is she crazy in bed?
 How so, specifically?
 Really?
 Its too late.
 I am already walking.
 Okay, what does that mean?
  Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
 Thanks.  Andy?
 Walk with me.
 Ohh, I do not have much time... cars all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldnt want to hear...
 Well... no, Im not. So I... Im not very articulate today, so Ill just leave it for another time. Another day.
 Which will be fine. I am off!
 Thank you!
  Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
  Dwight and Angela are having an affair. Theyve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
 All right. See you later.  Ahh.
 Yep.
 Right what?
 David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Dont ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where youve been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
 Sometimes Ill start a sentence, and I dont even know where its going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
 This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when its cooler.
  Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
 So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that Ive never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed."
  Oh, thank you.
 I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
 Okay.
 Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Heres an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!
 What you talking bout, Wallace?
 Hi, I am well, how are you?
 Oh, have you not?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Fax, why dont you just send it over on a dinosaur?
 Oh, well, then, email it to me.
 I will seduce her.
 No, I will seduce her.
 No, I got it.
 Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
 Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
 Michael Scarn.
 Okay.
  No.
 No, no, I never said Dennys. IHOP.
 Oh, dont start,
 You know what? I dont want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
 You will have pancakes and youll like it.
 So what?
 Maybe they are shrinking.
 They could be shrinking.
 Ah ha  Yup.
 Mm hmm .
 And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
 Argh, why are you all...
 Shut up.
 Ready to do this?
 Good. Here come the sharks.
 In nature, there is something called a food chain; its where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
 Hello.
 My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
 Thank you.
 We are a law firm.
 You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didnt feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
 Really? That many? This doesnt seem like a very big operation.
 Ah, so when did you set up shop?
 Oh Vietnam, I hear its lovely .
 So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
 Well that is... because... I am a genius.
 Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
 Try 80.
 Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
 Dont blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
 I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left
 Whats going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, thats not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
 Why is this little 2 so small? Its, its weird, you dont, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
 Excellent! Way to go! Nice!
 Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. Its going to be an incredibly hard decision.
 I... Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
 Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
 I cannot wait to contact your clients.
 Haha, we struck the mother load!
 Wallace is going to freak.
 Hes going to absolutely freak.
 Oh shoot.
 Oh God, what was that?
 Aw, its alright.
 Aw, my car.
 No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
 Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
 No, no, really not necessary.
 You know let me give you some money for this.
 Oh coffee, thats too much.
 Thank you.
 Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
 Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
 Ok. You know, our sales are fine. Were doing fine. Theyre doing fine.
 Why dont we just, live and let live?
 Live and let live.
 Its from James Bond.
 Im not going to make this call.
 My heart says...
 That is true.
 That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
 Jan... Ryan.
 Youre right.
 You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
 Just something I have to do first.
 Somewhere safe, where it cant hurt anyone
 Oh shoot!
 Those people will be ruined.
 Give it, give it. We cant do this to those people.
 Im not a shark.
  Mpfh.
 Thank you.
 Okay, bye bye.
 I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. Thats what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I dont even... whats the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
 Oh, hey what is this?
 Oh, she is hot.
 Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
 Stay  calm!
 Everyone, now  calm down!
 What does warm mean?
 Dont run.
 Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
 Okay, were trapped.  Everyone for himself.
  Help!! Help!!
 No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! Im gonna give him mouth to mouth.
 Hes going to swallow is tongue.
 Open your mouth.  Come on. Dont swallow it.
 Leave me al--
 Saving him!
 Electricity.
 Hed. Hedded
 Take hedded of.
 Heed. Heed.
 Take heed of.
 Take heed of.
 Okay.  This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
 Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
 I am not a mind reader, David.
 And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesnt like.
 Do you?
 You talking to me?
 What?
  No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A mans life is in my hands.
 Yeah.
 Thats not gonna happen. Im taking over as safety man.
 Yes.
 Im a smart guy.  Ill figure it out.
 No, I will.
 Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today."  Thats what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
 Shhh! Dont excite him. Dont make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley.
 Andy.
 No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
 Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
 Shut it.  Shut it.
 We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
 You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
 Come on.
 No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops?
 And youre okay with that?
 Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Lets do this.
 Come on Stanley.  Youre losing you.  Youre losing you. Do it!
 This is you were talking about.
 Okay, okay.  Ill show them. Here we go.  Stanley.  All right.
 No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
 Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
 How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You dont do anything.
 okay, thats uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
 I will divide and then count to it.
 Yes, yes I do.  I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
 Okay, I got it.
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive.
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
 He is an organ donor.
 Yeah.
 Hey, Stanley.
 Are you okay?
 Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
 Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
 Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
 Lets hear it.
  Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.  Ohmmm my God if youre wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
 My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. Its kinda nice...
  It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
 And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
 Too expensive.
 Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
 Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
 You have stress?
 During our relaxation exercise?
 No no, Ill help you. Ill help you up. Here we go.
 Let me getcha.
 Ok, alright.
 Ok.
 Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? Thats what HE said! Right guys, cause of gay?  Lets give this a shot.
 Hellloo...
 So... it wasnt Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that youre the killer... its uh... great twist. Great twist.
 I dont get it. Do I stress you out?
 Oh...
 Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. Its what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
 Ok everybody, Ive figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is whats causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
 What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh cmon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? Youve seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybodys laughing, and everybodys hugging each other...
 Si senor.
 Its not! Its not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Dont hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that Im so fit, or Im a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I dont want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
 I can already feel peoples stress starting to melt. I think theyre very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
 Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If youre here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
 Hey Hey, I dont go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
 Youre so lucky! Good one...
 Well...
 Pow pow pow...
  NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.
 I know where this is goin.
 No...
 No.
 Spite her - ok
 Oh, stop it Dwight.
 No no no no no no!
 Dwight youre supposed to do it this way.
 That is the way youre supposed to do it, idiot.
 Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
 Idiot.
 Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
 Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after theyre done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
 We are, we are a family.
 Oh very funny.
 Uhh... hehe hah! Im thinking Roy?
 I dont believe I have had the pleasure.
 Jefferson.
 Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isnt tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...
  Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
 You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems dont matter to him, because were just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  Im okay. No, Im not.
 I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
 Well I wrote them down so I wouldnt forget. Jim, youre 611 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, youre a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, youve slept with so many guys youre starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I cant decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, youre teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela wheres Angela?  Whoa there you are, I didnt see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...  Oscar, youre gay.
 Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And youre gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.  Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.
 They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.

  This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
 Could I stick it with a pin?
  Toby Flenderson to the principals office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and theyre wet with your urine.
 You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
 What?
 You find it?
 All right.
 Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
  Hello, good morning.
 You ready? And were off, like a herd of turtles.
 Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
 No! That is a toboggan, you never know when youre gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
 Yeah, oh dont say bucks, its not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
 Well that goes without saying.
 Hey! Look at what youre wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magicians assistant?  Thats...
  ...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
 No. Oh, all right.
 No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
 Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
 Well then... hey you know what then lets just talk.
 You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
 Is that why your wearing makeup today?
 Hello, Rolando, how are you?
 Rolando,  Id like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
 Okay, dont be nervous, just picture her naked.
 Thats what I do, steal my trick.
  Oh my God. Is that Jims?
 Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, youre huge! Thats incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... Im just, Im trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
 Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
  NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. Ill talk to you...  This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didnt! He is alive. And this isnt even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you cant return it. Or can you? No you cant.  Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
 I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
 Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
 I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
 I dont know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
 Got it. It works.
 But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
 Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think its worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
 Oh, I still have more.
 She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, lets go.
 I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."
 No, dont worry, the chain is off.
 Emails not scary. This is an opportunity. Dont, dont blow it.
 Its really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
 Oh, great.
 No, its really dorky. You were right the first time.
 Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. Its a really wonderful moment.
 I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
 Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
 Why?
 No.  Im just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
 Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
 She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didnt... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I havent talked to her since. I havent seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
  Ill just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
  Okay.
 I am on a lecture circuit. Im goin around to all the branches, and Im telling them my secret recipe for success.
 I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
  And I turn it on and I say Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.
 You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? Shes the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
 Do I look okay?
 Hi.
 Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
 Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
 Oh- Shes not here?
 A.J.
 She has a boyfriend.
 How could she do this to me, Pam?
 I cant do the presentation, I cant-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!
 I know, just... uh, please, Im going through something, okay?
 And then shell move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
||
||
 I can do this.
 Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Lets see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, youre a salesman. Whats, uh, whats your name?
 A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
 What do you race cars?
 Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. Youre funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
 Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so youre dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
 Huh-  Does she ever talk about me?
 Its all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention Michael Scott?
  Does it feel good?
  Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so lets just- Well just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay.
 Yeah, yeah... uh, I cant do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
 No, no, Im okay. Im all right.  Okay... okay.
||
 Want some pie?
 I went through Hollys things.
 I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
 I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
 I shouldnt have done it. It just- I couldnt help it.
 No, sh- she didnt. Im gonna read it.
 Yes.
 How?
 I know, I know. Youre right, youre right.
 No, that wouldnt-
 No, you dont have to do that.
 Okay.
 Well?
 She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
 Youre sure?
  Okay.
 I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
 Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
 Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
 Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
  Hello, may I help you?
 ...Jim.
 Ayyyy!
 Ayyyy!
  What was that?
 That was funny.  Lets go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
 Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
 Yeah, I hear ya.   Its been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think youre hurting...
 Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.    Theyre very pretty and I wouldnt want them to fall.
 Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentines Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
 Pam, really, theyre back?
 Can I have a word with you, Jim?
 Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
 Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, its creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
 --that none of us can be a part of--
  --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentines Day party.
 So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely hearts convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
 So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
 I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, thats a big needle, that --
 Okay.  Hello.
 Oh, OK.
 Yeah, me too.
 Oh, well, thats fine.
 Yeah, can I point something out to you?
 Youre actually talking a lot.
 Okay, here we go.
 Oh, God.
 Yup, Im good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.
 Type O-Ocean Spray.
 Yick.
 I looked at the bag.
 I looked straight at the bag.
 Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that dont have blood in them?
 That was mean.
 A hat.
 That is full of soup.
 What?
 Oh, already.
 Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I dont think I ate for three days.
  Oh my God, how long was I out?
 Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
 OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, thats hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if Im gonna return her glove.
 Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us.  Relationships, we dont need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
 Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, lets, who else?  Oscar.
 Come on, Im sure theres something you need to get off your chest.
 If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  Im sure whatever you did it wasnt your fault.  OK well, who else?
 Moron, if he was there wouldnt be a story.
 Really sad.
 Oh my God.
 Well then its a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
 Alright whos next?  Wheres Andy?
 What?
 You know what guys? I dont think we need to do this.
 No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentines, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  Theres a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
 No.  Not a giant net.
 I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
 Old fashioned meet market --
 -- I dont think it is.
 These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "Im in love I was hit by cupids sparrow."  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
 Hey.
 Ah, still early.
  So how you holding up?
 No.  No, I meant about being single today.
 Meh, exactly.  Eh.
 Oh, here we go.
 Hello.
 Babe alert!   Hello, Im Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
 Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
  So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.   Where you from?
 Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
 So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
 Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so thats sort of a repair.  Alright, Ill let you guys talk.
 Its going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause thats what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.  Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so  its not too late.
 No reason.
 Nobodys after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
 Its not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
 Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
 Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
 Hey, you dont deserve her.
 Hey, if anybody wants to go...
 Really?   Oh, thanks.
 You know what, you guys, you guys can get out Im gonna soldier on a little bit.
  OK.
 Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that Ive even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes its not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but its about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   Theres a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
 Pam?
 Pam? Knock, knock.
 I know you are. Knock, knock.
  4-9-1-7-4-5-1
 They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.
 Buddha.
  Buddha this bread for me, wont you?
 I, I need something to wipe my hand.
 That was helping. It was classic.
 No... God.
 Alright.
 Whos there?
 KGB -
 What the hell was that?
 What are you doing?
 You, you like that?
 Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. Thats it.
  Whos there?
 Dwight, get the door.
 Answer the door.
 Im not gonna answer it
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
 Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
 No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
 The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. Its probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
 Ive written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm.
 Too many words. Good ideas are simple. Golden ticket.
 No. Jim. Were a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
 No, you dont. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
 Woo hoo.
 Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
 ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
 Invite them on the tour.
 Really? Thats kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 I thought I did. So...
 Well no harm no foul.
 You didnt, but... itll be fine. Itll be good.
 Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
 Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
 Irrelevant.
 OK, Im going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
 My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybodys golden ticket idea.  That...
 Nobody panic. The good news is... they cant fire all of us, right?
 No, they cant.
 Oscar, you dont know what the hell you are talking about.
 Alright, then were screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
 Thank you, Jim is with me.
 Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
 OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
 OK, dont get that. Please?
 That is not constructive.
  Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
 How are you doing?
  My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
 Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just dont... I dont know.
 I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
 Youre breaking up.
 OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
 Yes.
 No.
  Yes.
  Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
 Woah, wow, who told you that?
  No, I dont think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
 Im not taking... Im not taking...
 Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
 Yes I do. Youve just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
 Why do you have a diary?
 OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
 Yes, you did.
 What are you writing?
 Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
 We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what youre thinking--
 Umm, nacho chips.
 Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
 Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean whats the point? Youre cooped up in there all day. You dont get to do your farming. Youre not dating Angela anymore. It doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesnt matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
  Its not ready yet.
 I have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called Shoe La La. And its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
 May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
 Yes they are, you just dont care about the information.
 He doesnt love it that much. Wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
 I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
 Right.
 Thats it. Thats it. You cant put a price on freedom.
 Thats why you made the decision. Thats why you made...
 You kind of have.
 Yes.
  Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- whats it gonna be, what are you gonna do?  Whats it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?  Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
 Yes it is, but it had to be done, didnt it?
 Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. Howd you come up with that idea?
 Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
 Give me the details of how that happened.
 What?
 David? David?
 David?
 Could I be a part of the meeting also?
 There is no movie called Willy Wonka. Its called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
 I cant... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
 OK, heres what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that its a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
 Oh how dare you.
 You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? Its a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
 Oh please.
 Toilet sponge. Its a hollowed out sponge...
 ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
 Theyre not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
 Thank You!
 Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
 When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And thats what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
 I want to see it.
 I want to see it.
 Give me...  Give me the diary.
  I like it.
  I think youre right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
  And classy, yeah.
   You know, thats good but its not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
  Yes.
  He is.
  Thats what makes him classy.
  Strawberries?
  Not classy at all.
  French. Classy.
   Yes?
  Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
  Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is.
  Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? Cmon, here we go, dont be shy, dont be shy, youre one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
  Yes.
  What? No, I didnt want to make everybody nervous.
  You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
  Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Lets go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
  Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from Os into Cs, for Charles.
  Took me all night.
  I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each others vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  Its gonna be mental! Its going to be mental.
  All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. Id like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
  Oh, nerd alert!
  This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didnt bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
  This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange
  There you go! Wheres the other?
  Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
  Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner.
  Oh! Well...
  Above and beyond.
  Thats true.
  No. Absolutely not.
  Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didnt want to worry people.
  Well, why dont-
  Charles is going to tell you.
  Well, its not official.
  Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
  Well-
  Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesnt it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
  Oh no, no, no. You dont have to do that. Ive got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
  I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that Im supposed to have. Thrilled.
   David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
  It was my understanding.
  Listen, why dont we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
  But the branch is still mine?
  Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
  Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?
  I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that youve never told anybody before.
  Come on. Whats your wifes name? Where did you work before you came here?
  Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
  Youre not from paper?
  Does David know this?
  Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
  And that- I-I dont need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, its all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
  Ok, alright, well Ill just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
  Whatever David wants.
   Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
  No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.
  Hi Stephanie, its Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the sons going to be returned, everythings fine.
  And I really really need to talk to David.
  I was never given a name.
  Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
  I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
  Nobody thanked me.
  For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think its a little hypercritical.
   Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
  Yep.
  Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
  Kevin? This is my branch. You dont ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
   Yes it is!
  No, it is not.
  Ok, so were on the same page, great.
  Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
  No, seriously.
  How old are you?
  Five years old?
  Im gonna walk away.
  Im kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, its just a joke. Its fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, lets continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
  What is that smaller stripper holding?
  Ok.
  Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
  Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jims? Go ahead.
  Its a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
  But its cool, and its-
   Whoa. Youre talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
  Yeah, why dont you do that?
  Yeah, here we go. Ok.
  What?
  Newsflash  Ive been here for fifteen years. Headline  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
  Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? Im going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  Im going to tell him everything. And Im sorry to say, youre screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And Im sorry. Im sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? Its not like steel. You dont put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? Youd ruin it.
  Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he?
   So is this the meeting youve been in all day?
  I drove.
  Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. Ive already bought em. And I dont have a place to store them. So, I feel like Ive been sort of boned.
  Do you talk to him about this? Youve talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
  Ok. Then I dont get it. It doesnt make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
  Clearly thats what you wanted.
  Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
  Ive put having a family on hold.
  And Ive never gone hang-gliding.  And Ive never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
  I dont understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesnt seem right to me. That doesnt seem fair. And I think that Ive earned more than that.
  Ok.
   I quit.
  You have no idea how high I can fly.
  I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Shouldve peed before I left.
  Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
  No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
  I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
  Why would I do that?
  You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
  Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
   What am I gonna do? Ill tell ya what Im gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. Im gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And Im going to stop worrying about calories.
  I have a job.
  Pam, what you dont understand is that at my level you just dont look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
  Any good headhunter knows I am available.
  Youre I need you to is my command.
  Hey.
  You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
  Oh! Hey. What is this about?
  Oh.
  Me too, me too. Is this wine?
  I already have wine.
  Hmm?
  For?
  Yes I am.
  Where you from?
  Thats a drive!
||
  Thank you.
  You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.
   What am I gong to do?  Uh... .
  PSST! PSST!
  Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
  Just close your eyes. Im going to start my own paper company.
  yeah!
  Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
  Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
  Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
  Close them.
  Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
  Obviously.
  Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
  Hey hey... whats up Chuck?
  No Im staying.
  Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
  You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
  This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
  Before you got here, Im the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  Im on it, dont worry.  So, how do I do that?
  Cant I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
  Thank you very much.
  Im starting my own paper company.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.  In all climates.  Its going to be worldwide.  And Im looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  Thats where you come in.
  Can you believe it? Well, well see, well see. Its just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
  Potential, lots of potential. yes.
  Its... its very courageous, very exciting. Um...
  Thats what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever Im gonna put my thing.
  So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
  I made it sterile.
  I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
  No, no no.
  Okay.
  Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You dont have to convince me.
   Stanley?
  Listen, Listen, Stanley. You dont have to answer me now.
  Just... I want you to think about it, Im starting my own company.
  Oh-okay, youre not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
   You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said Yes to that either.
  Hmm?
  Okay, I have immunity. Its my two-weeks...

  No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
  So which way are you leaning?
  Thanks Jim.
  Okay, Okay, we dont have much time.  Just act normal.  Dont look at me people. Stop.  Dont look down. Dont look down. Hes going to see me.  Dont look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  Youre older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?   Alright.

  Bye.
 Oh, good. My hookers here.  Hi.
 Yes I was. Yes I was.
 That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
 Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
 What shape?
 Alright.
 After breakfast.
 So how you feeling about the new company?
 You excited? About the new company?
 After breakfast.
 No, Im whipping them.
 Just let go.
 Let go, please. Just gimmee -
 I cant do this! This is pathetic, isnt it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
  I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
 Im not overwhelmed, Pam.
 Dont patronize me, Pam.
 Im not getting dressed. Im not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
 Its totally impossible!
 Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
 Okay, Ryan.
 Hes everything Im not and everything I am. Hes the whole package.
 Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman Ive ever met.
 He worked at that telemarketing place.
 Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
 Yeah.
 Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
 Yeah, I guess its not so bad. Got a few things cookin.  Umm...
 Alright.
 Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
 How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
 Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
 No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
 We can do this.
 Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If youll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
 Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  Its Michael.
 Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
 Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
 Im...
 Excuse me. Yes?
 Yes, it is.
 Yes.
 It is.
 Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
 Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
 Uh, nine.
  Look what hes doing.
 Hes stealing them. Okay, okay.
 Hes already paying for himself.
 Right here.
 Oh yeah.
 Sounds awesome.
 People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nanas investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then Im sure thats what she would have wanted. Does want.
 Well Im sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
 Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
 By wanting it more. By working hard-
 Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
 And I offer same day, free delivery.
 Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
 Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We dont - it doesnt have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
 Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We dont have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
 Whats that?
 Blech.
 Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And thats why God made so many.
 Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, lets get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
 I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. Thats what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
 So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... thats it. Thats our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people dont believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So Im gonna go inside. Im going to make some calls, Im gonna get us an office space, and Im going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
 You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. Theres gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
 I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. Thats what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Dont think a woman can be a man? Well, then thats your stereotype, not mine.
  Okay.
 Its right in the middle of the paper belt.
 Yeah, Im good. You good?
 You know what they say, keep your friends close.
 Yes, I am, Charles.
 Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. Were gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
 Its Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one.
 Hello! They took away my parking space but they cant take away my pride!
 I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
 We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
 We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
 I dont know I think weve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. Ive updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
 I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
 Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
 Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
 Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I dont make copies, Im the boss. Got it? I make originals.
 Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
 Would someone just make the copy?
 Just make that copy okay?
 Theyre getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks hes too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
 Im on the phone, please. Mom, Im gonna have to call you back. Ps being a giant B.
 They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
 Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
 Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
 Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
 No, youre supposed to say, "Rock the house."
 Thats my corner.
 No, this is where I work. I cant relax in the same corner where I work.
 Pam, I dont make the rules.
 Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
 Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
 What for?
 Yes.
 Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. Thatll show em.
 Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
 Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, youre the face of this company.
 Hey Pam.
 You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
 Yeah?
 Well, at least youre still being honest with me.
 These are shaped like paper.
 I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone.
 Dont tell them we have free delivery!
 They dont know that!
 Give him a guarantee.
 Just say the word.
 Yes!
 You did!
 Oh yeah!
 She did it!
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we dont have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really whats important.
 Hup!
 Hup!
 Hey.
  Is this good?
 Oh. Okay. Eds Tires, huh?
 I really appreciate it.
 Its for your trouble.
 No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
 Yes, I do.
 That was four years ago. Why dont you let it go?
 Eds Tires. Why dont you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
 That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
 Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
 Bring it in. Morning cheer.
  I need you to get me the prices that youre charging Eds tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
 Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
 Im not following you.
 Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think Im getting your drift.
 Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that youre writing?
 Can I use it?
  Dwight, are you talking about us?
 Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
 So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, dont you?
 Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
 Dwight?
 Is the cool new guy Charles?
 Is it Stanley?
 Hello, Dwight. Whats with the shirt? Are you alright?
 Oh my God! Run! Run! Its a setup. Setup!
 Dwight, run!
 You be cool.
 Just-whats going on?
 Mm-do... Dwight would not-
 I. Understand. Nothing.
  Wow.
 It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
 Its like, a girl says shell make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
 I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I dont know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I dont know. Is that clear enough for you?
 Hello, traitor.
 I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
 Im just getting hardcore with him.
 Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
  Is Mr. Schofield there?
  Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
 Wow. High score?
 Hello, Dwight, Ive been expecting your call. What do you want?
 So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
 No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? Theres no-
 Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
 Toward the sun.
 Noon.
 You have two seconds.
 Dwight.
 I hope youre not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
 So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
 If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
 I do too.
 Coopers.
 Damn it.
  Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
 Really? Thats weird. We didnt see any.
 What?
 Yeah, sure.
 Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. Hell be here in a sec.
  Yeah.
 Dwight, not now, weve been robbed.
 No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? Youre still stuck in traffic.  You?
 What about our truce?
 On purpose?
 Why?
 Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
 Oh.  Bastard!
 Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
 If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
 Oh, one more thing. Im going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
 Oh, uh oh, Im turning you down right now.
 You can hear me, but I cant hear you.
 Oh, great. Mr. Schofields ready to see me. Thank you so much.
 Walking in the door...
 Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And Im closing the door.
  Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
 Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
 What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
 Thats very rude.
 Im going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
 Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
 That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
 Good, good, good. I will see you.
 I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didnt bring it up?" Most colors mean "Dont say it."
 I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesnt feel as important though. Thats just how the world works, I guess.
  Its 430 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryans parents or Pams parents or my parents, you do.  Theyre gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
  Time to make the donuts.   Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I wont do it again.  Come on.   De-nied!
 Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!   Hey Pam.
 Milk and sugar.
 Thats what I said.
 Every morning.
 Were, uh, were doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, were having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
 You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
 Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
 Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
 Most do in the magazines.
 We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
 How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
 They are correct, sir.
 Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
 Lowest in town.
  Okay, sure. Right, so-- why dont you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
 Explain that.
 Well, we dont--
 Whatever, yeah.
 Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
 Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
 Just crunch em.  Just crunch em please.
 Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, Im going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but were just going to need a much, much bigger check.
 Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
 I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  Its this.
 I would love that.
 Was it nice?
 I love Pad Thai.
 No.  Theres a lot I havent done.
  Hmm?
 Were not hiring, Jim.
 Listen, I cant make you laugh right now.
 Jim, what you dont understand is that this companys worthl--
 No-- We dont have--
  Uh... Yes.
 Yes, well, were not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
 Thats a pun.
 Yep. Oh... wow.
 Of course not.
 Nope, nope, nope.
 Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that were broke.
 Oh, Im really worried that Im going to say it.
 Ah...
 Im good, Im good.
 It is.  Im good.
 Hello.
 Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe were expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables...
 And we are prepared to reject that offer.
 Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
 Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I dont even want to hear what your first offer was.
 Ill see your situation and Ill raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and youre going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I dont think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
  Well have to talk--
 Just amongst ourselves.
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 We are so rich.
 No.
 Its a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldnt you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
 Agreed?
 Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
 I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
 And I want Charles gone.
 I need him gone.
 Okay, then I want Pam back.
  Sales.
 Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in its heyday.
 And Ryan.
 You know, David.  I dont care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
 And dental this time.
 These are our demands.
 Our company is worth nothing.  Thats the difference between you and I.  Business isnt about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
 Thats one of em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
 Can we have the room please?
 Yes! Can you believe it?  Thats what Im talking about!
 There are certain defining moments in a persons life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I dont even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
 No, no. Youre done.
 Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now hes back.  Who could it be? Ill give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
  Its Michael Scott.   Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
 Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.   And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  Im going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
 If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
 Yes.
 Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
 When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
 Oscar, what were you going to say?
  All right.
 Not important.  Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
 Its going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
  No, you lost those clients.
 Okay.
  Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  Its a trash can.
  There you are, my friend.
 Pamela.
 Yep.
 I know.
 I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
 Michael Scott Paper Company only.
 Okay, well---
  I will--no, no.  Ill talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
 Against who?
 The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
 Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
 That was  us, right there.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, the Commish.
 Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
 Hey gang. Where you been?
  Whered you eat?
 Whatd you have, Stanley?
 So since you guys already ate, you wont be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?   Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
 Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
 Im going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
 Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
  Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
 Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
 Who quits?
 You guys gotta be kidding.
 I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, Im going to give you some seed money.   There you go.  Theres some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
 Yes I do.
  Its frontwards.
 No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  Im the bad guy.
 I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
  Whatever you guys did earlier.
 Just do it, okay?
  Get em there.  Get em there.
 Are you kidding me?
 Okay, okay, okay.
 So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
 If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
 They wouldnt make it unless people liked it.
 Okay.  If I give you your clients back there wont be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
 Fine, have your clients.  I can see thats what you wanted all along.   However, I rescind my apology.
 You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
 Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
   And Bingo was his name.  Lets go.
 I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
 Youre close with Pam too.
 Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, hes my number one choice.
 I like his hair.
 Okay.
 That sounds pretty biased.
  Okay. Pam, pros.
  I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesnt always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
 I dont need to tell you that.
  I dont think you are being totally impartial though, because you havent said one bad thing about Pam.
 Okay.  So be it, then youve lost credibility.  And Im going to go with my guy, and thats Ryan.
 Oh, wow!  Whoa!
 Ho-ho, man!  Wow.  Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  Cause Im not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
 I have a very difficult decision to make.  Its like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophies Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
  Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.   Well, theres no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
 I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just werent enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
 Im sorry, sorry.
   Yes, you did.
 Yep.
 No, you--no.
 No, youre the best person for the job.  Youre going to be great.
  Oh, oh!
 You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
 Oh, really?
 Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
 I dont know, I offered him his temp job back.  Well see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didnt get the job, so--
 I dont appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
 Oh! Whats our receptionists name?
  Could you send her in?
 Hello.
 Have a seat.
  This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.   Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
 He will be ushering you out.
 Oh, your face!  Oh!
 No, Im kidding.  No, youre not--youre not fired.  Yet.
 Oh...
 I dont know, actually.
  Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
 Guys, Im scared. Im really scared. I think Im growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
 Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
 Oh, really? Ok.
 What about the rest of you?
 At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I dont know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
 Who else? Who else? Ryan?
 Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
 What?
 Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
  I... was just learning... to... love.
 No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
 Thats good.
 If you ever want to come down here, doors always open, locks broken, so...
 Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
 Now you got it.
 Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
 You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
 Ok. I love it. I love it.
 I love it.
 Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. Theres no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
 Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Busters People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I dont know. Its like  Dave died or something.
  Daddys here and daddy is going to take care of you.
 I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
 Andys afwaid?
 Are you all afwaid?
 Daddys here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
 Funk is the problem and the solution.
 Ive taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
 Why dont you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
 No. Dwight is confusing you. That - its, its more of a disco.
 ... with coffee but without the haunted.
 Its a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
 Exactly.
 Wha - No. No. Not even close. I cant force you to go down but I can entice you. Im gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
 Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
 Holdin down the fort.
 Thank you.
 This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
 Kevin, stay.
 Kevin, stay.
 Stay, stay.
 Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
 Mmm-hmm.
 Come on.
 Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly youre just some terrible monster.
 Phyllis?
 Hey!
  Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
 Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
 Oh, wow! What did you do?
 You didnt do that. Youre ok. Youre ok. Lets lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
 Ok. Thats ok. Thats not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
 No. No. No.
 Its her back. We just - We need - Lets - You know what?
 Were going to take care of you. Were gonna get you help. Lets - come on.
 Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
 I dont need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
 Its just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
  Alright. Here we go.
 You having fun?
 What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, were going to put you in here. Dwights going to take care of you.
 Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
 Oh, you know. Nohting. Shes  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But shes a tough, old bird. So...
 Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I dont think she would trade that memory for anything.
 You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
 I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
 I dont care. Bury it. I hope youre happy.
 I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
 Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
 Its better than I imagined it!
 Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
 Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
 Oh. Alright. There you go.
 No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
 I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. Were not going to eat you."  No.
 Hey, thank you, Creed. youre really getting this place.
 Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
 No... cleaning... up.
 Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? Its really happening.
 You guys are the best for coming. You dont have to stay if you dont want to. I understand.
 Really?
 Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. Its not even to "Y".
 Would you like to dance?
||
  Uh oh. Whats so funny?
 Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, lets all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
 See you later!
 Were just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
 Mmhmm. Yeah, thats right.
 All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
 A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
 Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
 Okay.
 You can go to hell.  Im kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
 I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and Im going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesnt make any sense. Were soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
 What is up with you two, Holly?
 Cool. For who?
 Wow... Im designing a chair. Its part of your pants. You sit down, youre supported.
 All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
 You bet your fat ass we are.
 Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
 Thats right.
 Newspapers for sale!
 I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
  What?
 Um, no, I just thought wed wing it. That cool?
 We could do a movie... sort of thing.
 Oh!
 Could we get a Delorean?
 Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
 Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
 No. No.
 Were circling it.
  Uh, its a sketch now.
 And now, presenting...
||
 Yes, I am.
 Ohh, Im thinking... Im going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
  Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
 Yeah, Im definitely getting in. Im a shoo-in.
 Im Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay.
 Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than Ive ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
 Yes!
 I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
 David Wallace told me!!
  I guess not.
 Well... I didnt know they didnt know.
 Thank you.
 Well, hes just thinking about his own gifts.
 Probably shouldnt have mentioned Buffalo.
 Shouldve had hindsight.
 I think it went well. I think it was good.
 No, it was a tough audience.
 Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
 Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next years sketch.
 Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
 Good to see you.  AJ.
 I didnt find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year shell be with somebody, and the next year, Ill be with somebody, and its gonna take a long time... And then its perfect. Im in no rush.
  Parkour!
  Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
 Parkoooooour!
  Whos getting married?
 If somebody doesnt tell me, Im gonna start screaming.
 Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
 Did everybody know about this but me?
  Okay... okay.
  Youll never guess what I know.
 Eric likes Megan.
  How do you know this?
  I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether its not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesnt exist. Or that the sport doesnt exist? I shouldve known. Poopball?
  Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."
 Im talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
 Yes
 Well...
  Stanley was on your group date?
  Does anybody else know about this?
||
 There he goes. There he goes.
 So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
 Nothing? Well I got a little somethin somethin. I dont know if I should say...
 Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
 Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
 Who?
||
  You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
 Stanleys wife is out of town.
 Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
  I dont get it!
 Drugs?
  Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
  Stanley is having an affir.
  I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebodys attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
  That and that are the same letter.
 No... no. Hes holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. Whats that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What havent you guessed?
 T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and theres another one right there. Just sound that out. Youre almost there.
  Hey, Stanley! Where you goin, big guy? Up to no good?
 No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. Im casting a movie and Im looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
 Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
  Did you hear Stanleys having an affair?
 Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and its really sad because everybody thinks youre a loser...
||
  Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair?
 So Its not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
  So stupid!
 I know, I know.
 Oh, I bet.
 Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
 Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say theyre going on sales calls and then go someplace else? Cause thats not cool.
  Im not saying... a damn thing.
  You can count on me.
  Oh, that smells good.
 Did you hear about Angela? Thats pretty weird.
 Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quiznos on the turnpike.
 Uh huh.  Alright?
  How do you un-tell something? You cant. You cant put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything thats been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." Its like the end of Spartacus. Ive seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still dont know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
 Yeah.
 Anorexia. Shes an anorexatic.
 Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
  Im worried about Erin, because shes not a very good worker. I dont know how long shes gonna last here.
 Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
 Mm hmm.
  Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
 Yeah!
  Guys, guys... you cant believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! Its just... theres no stalking it. Its a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
  Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
  Yeah, yeah... you know what? Lets discredit these rumors.
 Thats not important, Jim, I just think we shouldnt listen to any of that crap.
||
 Nowhere.
||
  Okay, I made it all up.
 Yes.
 But guys, Im a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that Im a J. Crew model.
 Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
 Because a lot of people think that models, even though theyre very attractive, are somewhat vapid. Its set our industry back quite a bit.
 Okay, okay... heres the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didnt want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
  The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this persons life, is that...
 Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you cant fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
 Yes. Jim...
 Look at that!  That is the inside of your vagina!
  How long have you known about the pregnancy?
 A week? A month? A year?
 Did you pee on a stick?
 You shouldve told me.
||
||
 Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
 No, I have to take it, or itll seem suspicious.
 No, no, I can do this.
 Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I wont talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
  Hey, what up, Cynthia?
 Hold on a second, Cynthia.
 Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you cant stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I dont think you should ever try.
    Yeah?
   Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
   Im going in for a procedure today.
   Yeah, its routine.  Im just a little bit scared.
   It is a colonoscopy.
   In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
   My main concern, should I have a safe word?
   Abso... you know what? Ill do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
   Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, Im gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and youll get it Weds.
   Oh right, this thing. I remember now.    Whats this about?
   Its okay with me but hes gonna want me in there.
   Really?
   Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like Im gonna blow my brains out.
   Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
   Hey let me escort you to your desk.
   You and Jim are close, huh?
   Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
   Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
   If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  Thats how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
   I just dont want you to lie to me.  I dont want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
   I just dont want you to.
    Uh huh, well if he doesnt like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, Im going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
   Sorry about that.  Whatd I miss?
    Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I dont.  Yes, I do!  No, I dont mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.   Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
   Yeah.
   Nope.
   No, I think theyre talking about me.
   What is Jim telling him?  That I cant handle this job?  That s bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
    How are your sales doin?
   Shhh, Im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room, okay?
   Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that Im completely overwhelmed.
   You know when they say its so crazy it just might work?  Well, I dont believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
   Be my eyes.
    Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin?
   Yes, definitely.
   Look who youre talking to.
   Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
      Permission to speak on the record?
   Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I dont think so.  Because Big Bird doesnt make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
   Very much, Jim is my best friend. But its his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
  Its not very well written, but you get the gist.
   I can just continue to run it myself.
   This was Jims idea?
   Wow.  Ummm, well Id have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
   I cant help but feel partially responsible.
    Little pick me up?   Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
   Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
   Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
   Hmmm, thats weird, thats weird... its kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy.
   Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
   Yes!
   Yes.
   Hey David, this is Michael Scott.    Michael Scott here.
   Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
   Absolutely,  not.   Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
   Wha... heres the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
   Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
   Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
   I never recommended you because I didnt want to lose you and I didnt want to lose Pam,  and now I dont wanna lose the baby.
   Thats what she...
   Kind of in the middle of something here.
   I, yeah... no, Ill tell him myself.  Lets both.
    Hello.
   No, its just us.
   Oh, oh, well here he is right now.    Come in.
   Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
   I like that, so manager and co-manager.
   Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
   Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
   Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
   Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
   Whats happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
 No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jims now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
 That is not big picture.
 ... Okay.
 That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
 Youre trying to trick me.
 Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
 Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because Id like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
 Yes?
 Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
 Welcome.
 Mm-hmm.
 Disruptive.
 No, I dont think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
 Lets do.
 N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
 Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasnt about planets...
 At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
 Because its a big universe, and were all just little, tiny specks of dust.
 You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, its light out, you wake up, its dark. Thats the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
 Yes.
 Alright. No more meetings this week.
 I can be very suprising.
 Mm-hmm?
 Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
 Stanley, you dont need to answer that.
 What do you mean by "these people"?
 Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
 Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
 What do you guys think?
 No, no, no, you dont need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
 That is not what Wallace told us.
 That is not the way I heard it.
 It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
 No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace.
 Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why dont we just--
 Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
 Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
 Which is it more of?
 I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
 No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
 Talk to you later--  Okay, you didnt let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this.
 I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I dont see you anymore.
 All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
 You know, theres no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and dont say anything about it.
 No, we can do it during the day. It doesnt have to be that dramatic, Jim.
 Jim, dont take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
 You use your brain too much.
 Sometimes the smartest people dont think at all.
 As I was saying it.
  Con-- you look like a nerd.
 Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
 Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that theres a calculator down there.
 That will not go over well.
 Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? Im gonna kill myself.
 No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
 And then another--
 Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
 Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
 Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
 Okay. Well, why dont you tell me what those are, Jim? Why dont you enliven me?
 Ah.
 Okay, heres a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
 Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why dont you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it.
  This had better be terrible.
 That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know its hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
 My plan-- a man-- panama.
 Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what were going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
 What about a raise based on merit?
 Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
 Are you making a--
 Toby.
 Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
 Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick?
 I... will skip a turn.
 I need more time.
 Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
||
  How you doing?
 Oh, what are you usually?
 Usually a ten, but Im feeling like a zero.
 I know, I know.
 Yes, we did.
 Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.
 Youre welcome.
 Gin.
  Just pretend were not here.
  What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
 Its just a really important day for me.
 Thanks.
 Yes she does. Yes she does. Were all gonna go and were gonna have a good time.
 No.
 And, hey, dont embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
 Dont. Dont. Dont. You stole my joke. Dont steal my joke.
 Yes. I said that yesterday.
 Dwight...
 No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, thats my joke.
 This is what Im talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
 Pam and Jims wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
 Get out of here.
 Oh, my God, Dwight.
 Theres... a name.
 Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
 Is that all you have on her?
 Youre an idiot.
  Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
 Those glasses are super dark.
 Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
 You did?
 That was nice of you.
 Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
 Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
 No. No. Thats not how it works.
 Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
 Mmm-hmm.
 I dont have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
 Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
 Im staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
 I would do the same for you.
 Yes.
 Yes... just go--
 Oh. Thank God.
 Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you cant. And Ill tell you why.
 If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, shes going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
 Ok.
 I dont have a room?
 Ok. Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.
 Jerk.
 When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we dont know what happens because that story hasnt been told yet.
 Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
 Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
 You... are... kidding me.
 Im not a physics major, Stanley. Im just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
 Thats rude.
 You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shes very conservative. So, mums the word.
 How ya doin?
 Nice to meet you.
 Whos doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
 That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
 Didnt move my lips.
 Head table, where I belong.
 Well, whos that one?
 What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
 They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
 Thats not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasnt gonna make a toast and Im not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? Im so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car. Thats not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
 Thats a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
 Thats not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
 And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesnt have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
 Yeah. Go ahead.
  Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, theyre living together, theyre having lots of consentual sex--
 Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You cant expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, its just a different sensation.
 When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say its not different, but its a different sensation.
 When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. Its not necessarily different for the woman--
 ...but its different for the-- ok. Ok.
 Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
 Jim.
 That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
 I know. I cant believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
 I have not found that to be the case.
 Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
 Theres gonna be a free room?
 Hi, Mema. Its Michael.
 Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
 I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks shes better than everybody.
 Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.
 Youre welcome.
 Oh. Isnt he terrible? May I? Heres the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. Its not 1890 anymore. Its modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. Thats part of life.
 Exactly.
 I know.
 Theyre gonna name the baby after you, you know. Theyre gonna call it Mema.
 Yes, and if its a boy they will call it Sylvio.
 What are you wearing?
 Looks like youre going to a fish fry, Dwight.
 Ok.  Thats not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Lets go.
 Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. Its not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
 Yes.
 Why?
 Oh, my God. Twins. Im sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
 Theyre men, Dwight.
 Something is wrong with you.
   Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.
  I love you!
 Mmm!  Its after midnight.
 Oh my God.  Youre not going to be able to talk back.
  Shell be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "And... and clip my toenails."
  Now you sound like Kermit.
  Why dont you take a picture.  Itll last longer.  God.  Cant I get a little privacy?
  Hey, good morning.   Its about damn time.  I havent gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.    Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
   How can you eat like that?
  Yeah, Im hungry, but Im not going to make a pig out of myself.
  She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
 She was from Europe.
 Uh-huh.
 No.
 Wait a second.  Youre not into her?  Are you kidding me?
  Shes Pams best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
  No... youre crazy.
  Shes-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of peoples teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure theyre not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--
    I already have my European girlfriend.
 Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.    And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
  Hey, hey... Hes not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
 Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
   Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  Youre a mom.  I just figured you might have--
 Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
 Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?
  Im sorry.  Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
  my weekend was bad so far.
  I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
 And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
  It is a terrible year for love.
  Im thinking about having my sperm frozen.
 Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually.   There you go.  Use it in good health.
   Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
 Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
 The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because youre mental, if you dont have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
 Get out.
 Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you cant just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  What topics can you use for small talk?
 Mmhm.
 Mmhm.
 Yes, what else?
 No.
 Yeah! Thats good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Lets do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
 All right...
 Okay, okay. God. What you people dont know about business, I could fill a book with.
 What?
  The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, Im not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
 Oh hi. Im sorry, just a sec.  Erin, youre supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
 Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
 Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. Youre seeing how the sausage gets made.
 Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
 Mmhm.
 Yep.
 Okay.
 There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. Its like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
 Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
 Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
 Okay, well.
 Do your worst.
  Oh, great.
 Mmhm.
 Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
 No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
 There is no such things as monsters.
 Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
 I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
 He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
  Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
 Okay.
 Um it is, Grotti.
 Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
 Im not gonna lock my door.
 Its Grotti. Hes following up.
  "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."
 Yeah.
 Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
 Okay, Im calling the police.
 All right.
 Shh!
 Thats not gonna happen.
 What am I supposed to do here?
 I was thinking exactly the same thing.
 I dont know, I dont know about that.
 Hold on, hold on! Just-
 All right. I will meet with him, but Im not going alone.
  What are you wearing? Whos Pat?
 Lets go, come on.  God!
 Forget it! Forget it!
  Take that thing off the table! Please!
 Oh my God!
 Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
 Hello.
  Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
 Yes.
 Well.
 Okay.
 Thats not true.
 Okay shut up.
 I will have the gabba-gool.
 The gabba-gool.
 I dont, I dont have to have that.
 Guys, guys-
 Thats okay.
 Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
 If the salad is on top, I send it back.
 I dont think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
 No, no no, no. Come on. Im sorry, were having our salad.
 Hey, do you need any help?
 Hes a good mechanic.
 I dont...
 Okay, okay okay.
 Yep, all right.
 Put it down.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Its just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
 I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
 It was a lot of snap decisions.
 Yes!
 Just get in the car.
 Jim?
 Oh thank God.
 It wasnt easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think Im in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
 Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so Im turning to you my friend.
 Okay!
 Jim? Are you?
 What? Wait, I didnt hear a thing you just said.
 No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
  No!  Oh my God!
 No, Jim please, repeat what youre saying! I cant understand you!
  Jim?!?  Oh my God.
 Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I cant afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
 Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
 All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
 No. Hes not. Hes just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still dont understand how this works.
 But Grotti acts like hes mafia though.
||
 If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldnt tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
 This is Scott.
 Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
 Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. Im actually kind of POd.
 I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
 I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
 You suck!
 And Im not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
 How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
 Doubt it.
 What a tool.  What?
 No. What do you mean?
 What?
 Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But Im not.
 So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then theyre already dead." I said something like that.
 Erin?
 Coffee?
 Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If its not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
 Large. If its a medium I send it back. If its an extra large I send it back.
 Go.  Any questions?
 Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
 Is someone there? I cant see you because Im blind.
  It is?
 Theyre back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!
 And oh, Jim...
 Oh, I havent see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
 Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character Ive been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
||
 I have recently taken a lover.
 Pams mom.
 Pams mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
 About what?
 Oh, big time.
 She drives a green camry.
 And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
  What?
 Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
 Get the hell out of here, idiot.
 I think youre underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
 Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
 Shes right on my way home from work.
 I di- alright, Ill take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
 Yeah.
 Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
 Sure. Thanks for asking.
  Oh, wow.
 That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
 Erin, look.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, no, its nobody.
  Hmm... no.
 I dont.
  I dont deserve this, guys.
 No, I dont.
||
 I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
 Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
 It is.
 You want me to be happy?
 Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
 More than a friend, a co-worker.
 Its okay.
 That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
 Okay.
  Feels good.
 Im sleeping with Pams mom. Sometimes, dinner.
   Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
  That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and Im not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other peoples needs ahead of our own.
  Who wants to help the world one step at a time?   Alright, good.
  Alright, thats...
  Alright...
  Okay, Im out of here,  see you later guys...
  Ok, oh no heres an idea... conservation...
  Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?
   Can you hold down the fort?    Hey boo!
   Whats it... why are you crying?
   No, no, no, Ill talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, Ill let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
   Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
  For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
  Alright, in my defense...
  Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly Im outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  Im caring, Im generous, Im sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
  Lets get back to the matter at hand.
  No, no, no... no, no...
  I dont like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
  Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
  I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
   Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
  Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, Im sorry.
  Can I sit down for a second?
  This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
  She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
  Really?  Would you do that?
   Youre a good, good guy.
  No... thats...
  I dont... um... I cant hear your conversation.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... youre a jackass.    Hey, hey, you know what?  Youre just as stubborn as your mother, when you dont wanna do something you just dont do it.
  You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
  Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how were gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
  Well, that is not gonna happen!
  Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
  You know what?  Im gonna start dating her even harder.
  You know what it means.
  I dont need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pams mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, whats her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
   Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
  Night Erin.
 Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
 Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Dont worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
 I am going to scare these kids so bad.
 Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
 Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
 It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
 Who wants candy?
 ...and then I think Im going to go to the Garlic Festival.
 Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
 They have a TCBY booth.
 The same stuff you get downtown.
 Do you like TCBY?
 I cant believe its- I cant believe its yogurt. Uh... itll be fun
 You should give them a call. Check that out.
 Jims a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
 Wha- what?
 Why dont they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I dont understand.
 I dont want you to feel like Im baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
 Let me get your stroller.
 What are you gonna call him?
 No. What is his name?
 Mr. Bourchard. Theyre very formal.
 Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
 ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
 They are into style.
 They are into appearance. We are selling success.
 Thats sorta secondary.
 Alright. Hi. Any messages?
 Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
 It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasnt.
 It rained.
 Nothing. Cocoa.
 Good. Yep.
 Ok. Thank you.
  Yeah?
 Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, whats going on?
 Uh... I cant really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
 It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
 No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
 Not yet!
 No it is- dont! Im not gonna bump. Im not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
 Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
 Oh. He did? What did he say?
 Ok.
 Thank you, Stanley.
 Ok.
 Yes.
 I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
 I know what a flounder is.
 Im not usually the butt of the joke. Im usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and hed have to put on my suit and itd be too short and hed look... Damn it! Hed still look good.
 The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been Koi-ponded? Who heres been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
 Uh...
 You never said anything.
 Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, Stop because I want you to stop or STOP as in Stop. Youre making me laugh so hard. What youre doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!
 We are going to make a Do Not Mock list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? Im gonna kick it off. Lets see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
 Your nose?
 Alright.
 No. I havent finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? Thats it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybodys getting their chance.
 Ok. Thats to broad. Its gotta be something else. How bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
 Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And dont sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
 Ok.
 Its a fish.
 It couldve died of natural causes. So...
 Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
 What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
 No, no.
 No. We are not done here. This-
 No, Jim. You dont understand. Things like this dont just die. Kids in high school still call me Ponytail.
 Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
 I want to make fun of you right now.
 No. Dont do that. Youre not. Youre not stupid.
 Oh, my God.
 Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
 Well, you know what? Youre right, Phyllis, but Ive been there before. Ive seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. Thats the problem.
 Its ok. Were having fun. Its not actually the first time Ive been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, Who are your 5 friends? and Im, like, Uh...  I didnt even know I couldnt even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I dont even have Jans cell phone number and I hate her! She wont give it to me. I was like, Oh, I guess Im a loser. A luh-whooooo a za her.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
 Hey. Who wants to watch Michaels pond dive? My roommates friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and hes bringing it over.
 Is this the tape of me falling?
 No. Its ok. Watch it. He cant fire all of you.
 Its alright. I can handle it.
 I am a grown-up, Jim.
 I dont think you froze.
 Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
 Oscars a douche.
 No. Hes a- yeah, hes alright. Ok.
 Youre welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell.
 Morning Dwight.
 No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didnt want hers.  Because I guess Im the only aphrodisiac she needs.
 Well, yeah...
 It worked.
  I dont mind if I do.
 Im taking one for my lady friend.
 Brain food. Thank you very much.
  My girls.  There they are.
  Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  Itll cure all of your "Gee I dont know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I dont really see them together".  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.
 Yeah--
  I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
 No, that wouldnt be--
  Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
 Hey--
  Please, Kevin.  Youre fired.    Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
  Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldnt even be talking about business today.
  Today is about family.
  Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.
  What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
 What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
  Not about taking credit.  Lets just say we all did it.
  Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
 Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.
  Thats funny.
  Youre 54 years old.
  Youre 58 years old?
 Congratulations.
  The only time you should care about a womans age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
  That--
 Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
 Helene?
 I am.  Im definitely going to do it.  Ive already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
 So its a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  Its not anything you would have ever done.
  Well theres no jumping in a triathlon.
  Youre thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
 Snowboarding?
 I might.
   Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I dont know.
 Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
 So we should get the check?
 Oh, no, no, no. No.  Its stupid.  Youd hate it.  I hate it.
  Yes you will.
  I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.
  Thats just an arbitrary title.
  Its not amazing... at all.  Its sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish wont come true, so that blows.
 Oh that I plagiarized I think.
  Well, thats because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  Its a generational-- sort of gap between us.
  That was a bunt.
 Oh, just went to the bathroom.
 I got thirsty.
  Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.
  Finish your cake, Helene.
  I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
  Helene I think youre a wonderful person and I-- God-- Ive enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pams feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
  No its not.
  Wow.  That just-- youve really grown.
  Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  Ive never-- I dont know him.  Theres another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
 And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
  Its not my decision.  Its mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--   -- tility.
  Well, hobbies--
  Pamela Beesly Halpert--
 May I have a word with you in my office please?
 Well, this is a work related matter.
 Yes.
 Yes.  Join me please, wont you?   I am going to give you a raise.
 Because of all the good work youve done.
  Thats-- no, no-- its not about numbers, Pam.  Its about attitude.
  Do you want the raise or what?
 Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.    And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
 No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying dont-- unless I havent offered you enough... your face isnt changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pams brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
  What?
  Oh-- okay , what? I dont-- Are you kidding?
 Ye-- No.  Alright.  Ill take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
  Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
  See you.
 Hey.
 Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--
 What punch?
 Im pretty sure we said slap.
 I-- mmm-- Im good.
  Hey.
 Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
 I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
 Really?
 She strong?
 Can you stop this?
 Okay.
 I dont either.
 Mmm-hmm.  I know.
 You gotta do something--
 How much time do you think youll need?
 Come on, man!
 Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdos pay dominatrixs hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  Im scared Im gonna love it.   Lets do this.
 Its okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
 Youre just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
 Yes.
  I know.  Okay.  Alright.   Oh-- God!
 Okay!  Pam, Pam-- Im really sorry.  Im sorry.
 So many things.  I dont know.  Its hard to choose.
 Maybe that--
 Yes.
  Okay.  I promise.   For the record your mom came on to me.
 No!
  I dont know.
 As I watched Pams big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesnt sound like much, but its enough for me.
 Ahh...
 Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.
  No.
 What are you talking about--
  Forget that.
  No.
  Oh that feels better.
  But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
  You did?
  That sounds like it was hilarious.
  Yes?
  Youll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
  Woo hoo, shout out!
  Erin, do we have the journal?
  Did you?
 Oh, the Wall.
  Its $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say?
  No, no, that doesnt make any sense.
  Oh, that sounds awful.
  Oh God.  Well, thats an interesting theory.
  Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.   Oh my God, wouldnt that be hilarious!
  OK, OK.  Good.  Ill catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye.   Hes busy, hell call me back when hes free.
  No, Im just poopin.  You know how I be.
  Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
  OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesnt even need to be good.  Oh God, I cant think, need more Mullins.
 Monkey see, monkey do.
  Monkey pee all over you.
  We have a monthly staff meeting
  What? Oh my God!    There has been a murder.  Theres been a murder in Savannah.
  Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I dont think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
 It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
  This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, its about murder.
  Tube City, you owe me one.
 There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
  Sandwich platters.
 Baby carrots.
  OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
  OK, use your imaginations.
  Its not scary.
  Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
   Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?
  Whos Michael?  Im Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
  That is the way Southern people talk.
  Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
  No, no, no. Dont turn this into a political thing.
  Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
 I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
   Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
  Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
   Whoa. Whats this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This heres Savannah.
  No no no no no no no.  Im going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
   Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- thats a misdirection.  We still dont know who the murderer is.   Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I cant do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
  I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Yall skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
  No it aint.
 I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
  This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
  You are out of order.
  You are-
   Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
  Cant wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
  To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
  Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
  No Michael here, my name is-
  No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright?
   Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?
  Detective Wallace?
  Aw, shucks, tell him Im not here.
  No, I only answer to Detective Wallace cause I got a warm body in the other room.
  A murder, you say?  I do declare.
  Get in there!
  There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.   Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
  On the count of three were all going to put down our guns.
  Well put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
  One, two, three..
  Ok. Ok. How bout this?
 I want it to be better than Great, Pam. How bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.
 Nope. Then my face is down. They cant see my face.
 Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if titles important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholders meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
 Ok. Obviously Im not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
 I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? Its not even a twirl, its a spin. I might do the spin.
 Ok, Oscar, I dont need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
 Well, could you condense it please?
 Its not a limo. Its a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
 They sent a limo.
 Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when theyre in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
  Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
 Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
 Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because youre invited and youre invited and youre invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
 What?
 The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
  Mmm... whoa.
  I wish the windows werent tinted so people could see us in here.
 Definitely.
 Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. Thats bigger than my bed.
  Whos playing with the button?
 I will have to answer.
 No, no. Thats too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, Well, were sort of on thin ice.  I wont say that. Ill something like that.
 Oh, my god. This is it.
 Yes.
 Oh, hi.
 Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
 Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
 See you later.
  Officers. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Hello.
 Thank you.
 Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
 Its nice to meet you, too. Its an honor and a privilege.
 Ah.  Your eminence.
 You guys ever protect the president?
 What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
 Rock and roll.
  This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
  Were going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry.
 Hey, hey, hey. Im sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. Thats -
 Yes.
  Yeah, well, thats not gonna happen. Thats not gonna happen. Well be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that youre mad at me and youre mad at all them -
 Ok. Alright. We are gonna - were gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. Were gonna come back with a plan for you. Its a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. Its a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You.
 Wow. Things are really picking up.
 What?
 I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
 We tell them the plan, right?
 Heres what were gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
 Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
 I am the guy who roused that crowd.
 Got them on their feet.
 They were so happy down there.
 Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
 Well, Im texting him, so.
 Its done.
 Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Dont be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why dont you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.
 Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
 Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
 Its all good. Its all good stuff. Lay it on them.
 That wasnt what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
 O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?
 Wow, man. That -
 That was embarrassing.
 For me, too. You embarrassed me.
 Well, that was a waste of a text. Lets get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We dont seem to have a plan so Im thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
 Uh, Im not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... youre the moron.
||
 Yes it is a thrill to be honored by ones company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, Wow. Great job.  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So were leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
  Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
 Yeah, Have a seat.
 Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
 I have it on good authority that you said the following.   Can you read that back to me?
 Mmm-hmm.
 Okay.
 You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand."
 You cant be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
 Okay, who said that?
  Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what its worth I think your baby voice is tops.
  Youre welcome, baby.
 Keep.
 I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
 Keep.
 For what?
 Oh okay.  I dont know how those got on there...
 Must be hackers.
 What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
 Worse than that.
 Lurk much?   I miss Pam.
 Is that what were going for now?  "okay?"  We used to go for "pretty good."
 Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  Im not in this for the trophies, but...
 Well, technically, Im a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
  It would look good, on my mantle.
 There you are.  I dont think we have finished with my Inbox.
 To change lives.
 Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I cant go through with this.
 Well...
 No.
 I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didnt want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  Ive made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
 Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
 Im not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids Id pay for college.  Okay, all right.
 Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of...
 Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
 Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
 Good to see you.  Wheres your saxaphone?
 Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
 Well, you didnt even hear it.
 Oh, good.
 Sure.
 Oh, yeah.
 No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
 Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldnt go in there.  Im pretty busy, I should just...
 Oh.
 Wow!
  Oh, God.  Oh, God.
 All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I dont think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, Ive done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm.  Should we go?
 Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know whats invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know whats gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, youre going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... Im sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
 Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition.  Im so, so sorry.
 Im sorry.  Im sorry.  Im so sorry.
 I lied to myself too.  Im not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasnt even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I dont know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
 Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I cant pay for your college.  But you dont have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
 Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Theyre lithium.
 Erin, can you give us a second?
 Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, Im sorry.
 What can I do?
 I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
 Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
 Really? Wow.  Thats over $200 a year.
 For-okay, okay heres what Im gonna do.  Im going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  Im going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause Ive got monies to move around.
 Thats a lot of zeroes.
 Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
 Yes.
 Youre what, like, 12?
 I think youre doing a great job.
 What do you want from this job, provided the company doesnt go out of business?
 Really?
 You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
 Yeah.  I just sortve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
 Heeeeeeres Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.
 What the hell is going on?
 Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
 Phyllis?
 Take it back. That is absurd.
 No? No! Jim! Come on!
 Its insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesnt it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
 Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
 If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and shed ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. Its a good thing Russia doesnt exist anymore.
  Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, Im the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
 No its not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, whats your name?
 Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
 Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
 What would you like for Christmas little boy?
 What did you think was going to happen?
 All right, just say "some toys" please.
 Damn it Kevin, come on.
 Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
 Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesnt have to go through this again.
 Ryan come here!
 Come on, come on.
 Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!
 Just sit down!
 Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
 Whoop! Okay, what?
 Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
 Do you understand, you forced my hand?
 Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why dont "we" take a vote on it?
 Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
 No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
 Ill get some punch. That looks delicious.
 I dont ask for much for Christmas, I really dont. Its not like Im begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or Im gonna kill myself."  Thats not - I dont care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, dont look at me.
 Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, thats great. Im excited by that. And those of you who dont, I forgive you. But I never forget.
 Oh the Anti-Christ!
 Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what youre saying?
 Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
  Uh oh, whats Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
 Oh yes. Its space garbage. Dwights gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
  Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adulterys a sin, look it up in the Bible people. Whatd you get?
  Oh, thats appropriate. Lot of fire where youre going. Better get used to it. Youre going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. Youre going to Hell Stanley.
  I cant see from here people. Somebody shout it out, dont make me get up.
  Thats fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
  No!
  Andy had Erin.
  What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.
 David, guess who Im sitting here dressed as.
 Ill give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
 Im Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
 What?
 Really? Whats going on?
 What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
 Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
 What does that mean?
 Well, cant Alan protect you?
 All of us?
 Oh my God.
 Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And thats one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
 Hey. Hows everybody doing?
 That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
 You know whats even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Heres my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
 I dont want to say. But, "its fun to stay at the -"
 "Its fun to stay at the -"
  Mmm, mm mm mm.
 You know what, Christmas isnt about Santa, or Jesus. Its about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, youre my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, youre our mailman. And I cant help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?"
 Its not... Nevermind. Nothing.
 I didnt say anything!
 Were going out of business!
 David told me on the phone. David told me.
 Earlier today.
 He said, we have been sold.
 Dwight! Jesus!
 Davids gone. Alans gone. Were all gone.
 Its hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
 Ill call him. Ill call David.
 Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
 He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them Im a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
 Its not sweetie, its Michael Scott.
 Stephanie could you hop off please?
 David!
 David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
 David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
 Well I think were past that now.
 Were not fired?
 Yeah!  Its a Christmas miracle!
 Woo hoo!
 Oh! You got it? What is that?
 Huh. Well, maybe those will help.
 Hi Santa.
 Id like to make a wish.
 I would like an Xbox, and a TV thats compatible with an Xbox. And, Im sorry.
 You called Bob?
 Come on! Phyllis!
 Okay.
 Oh God. Get a room Santas!
 Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
 Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... Im... pretty nervous about it. And... Im... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
  I see youve met Computron, our virtual helper. Im Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
 What is the worlds largest ocean?
 Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
 That is fantastic. Its good, but its not good enough. Keep working. And heres Pam. Shes our international sales consultant.
 Hello, Stanley.
 Ok. Well, I thought Id show you around a little bit -
 - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Coopers Seafood. You like lobster? Youve had lobster before, right?
 They make the best Maine lobster in the world. Youll love it.
 No, Computron, actually I think Coopers is the best. Youre gonna love it.
  Oh, my God.
 Alright. Excuse me.  If you will -
 - follow me this way. Ill introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.
 I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Tobys favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
 Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin? Whatcha guys talkin about?
 Stuff. I love stuff.
 HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
 Ah.
 Talkin bout, uh, what?
 Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
 Oh, time and resources.
 No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.
 This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that?
 Thats, that is true.
 I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?
 I dont care if he goes and files a report and says that were nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
 Computron, Im gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
 Just - sh -
 Shut -
 Shut up. Shut up.
  Sittin in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin.
 So check out how we live
 They call it Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that cause of the electricity. The citys laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if youre bitten by a spider.
 Plenty of space in the parking lot.
 Snack attack time.
 We like Cuginos
 They call it Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 The Electric City. Scranton!
 Ugh.
 Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how bout you?
 Its from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder whats inside. Scissor me.
  Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.   They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didnt need them touching our asses.
 Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
 Cool. What next?
 Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
 Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
 And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
 And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.
 Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
  Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
 Alright, hes on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
 Why do I have to explain everything?
 Okay.
 Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
 You know what, Dwight? Lets give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
 Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
 In training.
 Were very excited too, arent we guys? Right?
 We have a little song prepared for you.
 Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
 Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
 Saber.
 Wow. Really terrific.
 Perfect.
 No. Dont like that.
 Mm, nope. Dont like that.
 Well still get to use the little cups, though, right?
 I dont know what theyre made of.
 You know what cant fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everythings running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
 There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
  Really? You dont have enough water in there? Your stomach?
 What?
 I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
 I dont want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabres doing for us.
 Well, you should have a little. But its great that you dont, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but Im - Ill be honest, Im having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of em.
 All of them.
 So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. Im good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
 Hello. No. My names Michael Scott. Hello.
 Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
 Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
 Ok. I feel very strongly that you cant just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. Hed know what to do.
 I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
 I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry.
 I hope youre not busy doing something.
 You sure?
 You look great too.
 Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
 Hey. Wow.
 Really loud.
 Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend.
 Can I just stay here and never go back?
 Oh, man. How much time do you have?
 Yeah.
 Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought Id come by, see...
 I dont know.
 Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They dont let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
 Exactly. What are you thinking?
 It is a tough one.
 Yeah. But one would be good.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So the kids making the noise to pick it up.
 Oh, okay.
 No, I think it is-
 Yep.
 The what?
 Oh, okay.
 Like it.
 There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of em.
 See you later.
 Bye now.
 Thanks for having me.
 Well, thats not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallaces house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
 Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabes homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
 You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. Thats the best thing? Really? Ugh.
 Well, Im not really one for making speeches.
 But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
 No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
 Heres my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
 Heres the toast. Im gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
 Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. Thats like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesnt it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
 Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
 Okey doke.
 What?
 No.
 No.  Were trying to look it up right now.
 Um, come on.
 Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. Ive always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
 Oh.
 Thats it!
 Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
 Okay, put it on my card.
 Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so shes gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
  Why hello!
 Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
 Jo, I dont know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
 Whoa, whoa!
 And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
 Forget the question...
 I humbly accept the management position.
 Because, well, Jim. Where Im from, two types of folk those who aint, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type aint you aint? Yall come back now.
 Yes.
 No, we know. Texas!
 I could manage my way around that.
 I will try to manage my excitement!
 I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I cant even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.
 Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
 What?
 What? Really?
 Wow!
 La la la, hello Oscar!
 What are you reading?
 Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I cant keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
 Why, is there an untapped gay market?
 ...Where did you get that information.
 Manuel who?
 Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
 Son of a bitch.  Pardon me.
 Okay.
 Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
 Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you cant take the sales out of salesman.
 No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
 Im turning myself in right now!
 Thank you.
 Great! Thats great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
 How is that possible?
 No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
 Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.
  It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentlemans club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
 Why not? Its part of the sales experience.
 Well, okay...
 What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
 No, Im serious, we dont have to put up... Is it the dogs?
 You know what, we dont have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
 No, this is geological.
 Are you kidding me?
 And you guys are okay with this?
 Oh my God.
 Hey.
 You know, its funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now Im out there, and I wish I was in here.
 Yeah. Except theres no grass out there. Its just a farty dirt patch.
 I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
 We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, thats stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
 Lethal Weapon?
 What? What Im saying...
 And weirdly Im a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.
 Alright!
 Oh, it smells good in here.
 Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
  Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  Shes contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
  Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
  Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
  Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
  Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I dont want to know.  Tell me later.  Lets go!  Lets go!  Hospital!
  Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Dont get revenge on me, nerd.
  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You cant tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
  Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Lets go!
  Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
  The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body.
  I will allow that.
  Okay.
  Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
  Yes, Phyl?
   Nope, nope, I dont think anybody wants to see that.
    That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
    Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
  Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Lets have happy times.
  Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And Im thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
  Okay, nobody touch Pams nipples.  Think of Pams nipples as Tobys grundle.
  Okay, yeah, why dont you go get it?
  Okay, the opposite of that?
  Ooh, someones freakin.
  I think he is.
  Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, its time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
  435.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didnt have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Lets go to the hospital, shall we?
  We can do...
  Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
  What is October feast?
  Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and its time to go to the hospital.
  Thats right, lets do this.
  Lets go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
  Are you kidding?
  You can do this.  You can do this.
  Im scared, too.
  Yeah.
  Were going to have a baby.
  Lets do that.
  Two minutes apart.
  Its okay.
  I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
  Were okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
  Youre not going to.  You know where youre going?
  Yes, you are.  And you know what youre going to have?
  Yes!  Were going to the hospital and were going to have a baby.
  I got it!  I got it!  Everybody its go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
  No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
  Yes.
  Go bag! Wheres my go bag?  Wheres my go bag?
  You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
  No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
  Thank you!  Wish me luck!
   Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
  Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  Were going now!
  No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
  Dwight, what is the traffic like?
  Alright.
  Geesh, Dwight!
  What!?
  Where?
  By the bushes?
  Okay, go, go, go, go!
  Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
  Yeah?
  Im texting about you, okay!?
  Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.    Ready?
  Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
  Okay.
  Okay.
  Do you have everything, guys?
  Okay, alright.
  Dunder-Mifflin.  Its okay.    I just did.
  Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
    Okay, not yet, not yet.  Im going to go wash my eyes.
  That kids going to have a lot of hair.
  I think its going to be any minute now.
  Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
  Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
    Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
  Youre starting, youre kinda losing them.
    Yeah, thats right.  Its a baby, see?
  Okay.  You cant smoke anywhere these days.
  Guys, guys!
  Eleven pounds...
  Thank you!  Thank you!
  Wheres the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
  Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
  Love you, as a friend.
  Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
  Alright.
  Oh, okay.
  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
  There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
  Who else here is single?
  I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
  Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you dont have any?    Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
  Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, youre obviously single.
  Andrew, what about you?
  Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
  What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
  I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
  Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop em in your mouth.  Why dont you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
  Good!
  Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
  Bye.
  Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
  Im not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
  No, Kevin doesnt have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it wont kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
  Just dont let him sit on you...  Im kidding.  Youll have fun.  Itll be good.  Itll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
  Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
  Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
  Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And Im surprised that you didnt question me in the first place.
  No.
  Lynn was as hot as Erin.
  This isnt about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
  Kev...  Nice.  Going.
    There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think Im going to be sick...
 Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Natures Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. Itll be a good day.
 It is St. Patricks Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
 Morning, honey-pile.
 It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
 Yes it is!
 No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
 Mm, that sounds great, actually.
 When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I dont care if youre a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
 That is a great idea JB.
 Oscar, homosexual accountant.
 Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
 Okay.
 Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! Were very proud of you. You know what, were gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
 Oh no! Say its not so, Jo, were gonna miss you, were gonna miss you so much!
 Well, I am heading down there.
 How about July 4th weekend?
 I did!
 You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
 All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
 Lets follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesnt like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
 Hello. I want you to stop what youre doing right now. You are stressed, and Im taking you to lunch.
 No is not an option.
 All right. Well if you need me, Ill be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
  Ill be over there.
 Very nice.
 A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jos eye. Howd you make that happen?
 Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
 How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
 Okay. All right.
 Hey there. So I think Im done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
 Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
 Right. What?
 Mm. mm. Oh well.
 No, no, no. Thats super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
 Hey Pack-man.
 How you doing stud? You already there?
 Hows the lady situation?
 Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
 Yeah. Maybe next year.
 How late do we have to work tonight?
 Why does she do that? Why doesnt she just tell you what your schedule is?
 Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I wouldve turned thirty. Thats just - thats just depressing.
 Hello Jo.
 There is, as a matter of fact. Its getting sorta late. Its 830. And its St. Patricks Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided Im going to dismiss my employees.
 Im thrilled with the work theyve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
 Okay. Happy St. Patricks Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
 Yes.
 Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
 Drinks are on me!
 Oh -hoh! All right.
 Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I dont know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Dont worry, be happy."
 Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?
 Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is?
 Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
  I am flattered. Thats Johnny Depp.
 In my condo complex.
 I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
  Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
 Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
 No. Im Captain Jack Sparrow.
 Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, its not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought youd seen Roger Clemens?
 Yeah. Well, it wasnt him.
 I know, I know.
 I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
  First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you dont have a pet, please dont feel like -
 Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meetings not over.
 No sales topic per se.
 Dwight?
 I would like your undivided attention, please.
 Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think its kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
 Yeah.
 M-hmm.
 Is that all you have to say to me?
 Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. Its a big cheque.
 Stop sexting Pam. Im trying to congratulate you.
 You writing your memoirs over there?
 Well, its a pretty big check.
 Okay. Dont gloat. Heres the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
 Im just saying, that -
 Honey and jelly sandwich time.
 Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. Thats -
 You saw who did this and you didnt stop them?
 The sales department smashed my sandwich.
 You dont get it.
 Thats what she said.
 Yeah.
 Thank you very much.
 Ah, just the stupid leads.
 Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what Im thinking? Im thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you dont. Not even Sabre owns this place. Its a rental. Im kind of sick of the attitude around here. Im sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.
 Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
 They act like I have no power.
 Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
 Exactly that.
 Exactly that.
 Hello. May I have everyones attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so Im going to give the leads to... King Creed!
 - and to King Meredith!
 And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens .
 Im giving them the leads, Phyllis.
 Hey.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 Alright.
 Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids dont respect the father who doesnt respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
 I do understand it.
 Or is it?
 Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldnt be in this business.
 Well, bigshot, If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes.
 Wait. What day is today?
 Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
 Okay. You know what, lets just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, cmon, shotgun in my car -
 Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, theyre now in the city dump."
 Well, thats not the way its going t sound. Heres what were going to do. Well go to the dump, well look around, then well all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
 Really?
 Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!
 You can.
 Okay fine, I get it. Ill just go by myself.
 You know, Dwight, there was a time when youd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
 Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you dont believe me, look in my gutters.
  Youve changed, man.
 Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
 No, Im talking about your personality, Dwight.
 Assistant to the managed him -
 Yeah.
 You think you would have done better without me? Really?
 Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldnt have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
 You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
  Thats my wife youre talking about, man.
 If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
 No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!
 Dont even think about that
 Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god.
 Were never going to find those leads, are we?
 This  Why would somebody throw that out?
 Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?
 Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. Thats it. And the caption would read
 In the dump.
 No! Better!
How many is that?
Count the last one.
Oh, new record!
Oh, what did you do today?
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
My respect.  Okay, Ill make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Gets to go home.  Ooh! I say dance, they say how high? Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high.  Disqualified!
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
 Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Yeah, Im betting one more.
Good.
Alright, alright.
Well, its not exactly fair. Hes got all of his weight thats helping him go down.
Yes?
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
Ok, yes. Sure.
No, I got that.
I am in.
Its a deal.
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!
Its not a birthday, its not a good-bye party...
Sucks to be you.
That would be sublime.
Yes.
Hello, how are you?
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
So, what do you do?
Really?
See, I didnt think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
About what?
Shes nice.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, sure.
About what?
 Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.
Guys, come on, Im on a date. Let me do my thang.
Hi, Im date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?
Hey, guys, guys, guys.  Watch this. Ready?
Im tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
 Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, why dont you send the bill to 23 I Dont Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Hey, she can tell Im on a date, right? Right? Im just having fun.
Really? You told on me. Thats lame.
Yes. Homelessness. What?
Where?
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. Im just kidding around. Im sorry.
She cant talk to us that way.
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Well, I am starting it again!
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and Im gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I dont see that from you.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
Ive written all of it... in my head.
If youre really interested, its called Somehow I Manage and theres going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
I own a Chrysler.
No, you shut up.
Grenadine.
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
No, no.
No, its Michael Scott.
He is I.
Oh, hey guys.
Hey, Julie! You having fun?
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
I think I did. But I cant take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
 Im going to give Erin $15.
 A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
 Shes kind of a rube.
 Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Ill take her to lunch.
  Hi, Erin. Happy Secretarys Day.
 I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
 Ugh.
 Well, Hayworths is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So Im...
 Okay, well, well figure something.
  Okay, lets go to Hayworths.
 All right.
  Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? Im kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
  I dont know.
 Ahhh.
 Right.
 An age or month?
 Ive been trying. Ive been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
 So how are things going with Andy?
 Well, lets see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
 Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I dont think he is a snappy dresser.
 I dont think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
 Mm-hmm. You didnt know that? Oh.
 Okay.
 I dont know. Probably didnt want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
 They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?
 Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
 Thank you.
 Mm-hmm. Yeah.
 Well...
 What are you doing? What are you doing?
 Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybodys looking at you right now.
  Ill have what shes having!
  Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
 You know what, I think we can all agree that Angelas not so great, so..
 No. No. No.
 Stop talking.
 Oh God.
 Andy, shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? Thats like.. thats like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
 You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I cant and wont keep a secret.
 Erin?
 No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
 Oh. Yep. Im sorry about that. I feel... Im sorry I caused that thing.
 Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldnt worry about Angela. She doesnt hold a candle to you, Erin. Shes old enough to be your mom for one thing. And shes, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I dont think shes ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
 You said butt.
 Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him "Hey! Hey Scott!"
  Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster.
 Buenos dias, Erin.
 No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
 I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
 Buenos dias, Jaime.
 Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
 La telefona.
  Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
 Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.
 Yo soy Cancun.
 Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
 I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
 Did somebody order a hooker over here?
 Hi. How are you?
 Theres this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexters and, right now, were in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
 Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
  Hi.
 Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victorias Secret?
 Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
 Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
 Okay, I have more of them.
 I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
 And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
| Its subtle. Thats how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesnt know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that shes turned on.|
 This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. Ive never taken anybody there before.
 Ryan.
 And thats it. Thats me. Thats who I am.
 Oh, thanks.  Youre not bad, either.
 Hmm.
 Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
  You didnt see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
 Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
 Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
 So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
 Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
 I think we could.
 Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
 Why dont you run them again?
 If she is, its working.
 So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
 Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
 I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
 Theyre good
 Sure.
 I cant stop myself from kissing her.
 Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me its not totally insane to try one more time.
 Okay. What do you think?
 Andy?
 Okay, some for, some against.
 Pam?
 Im going with Pams group.
 Here we go.
 Okay.
 No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
 What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but thats not... the point.
 We should have your contract done by Thursday.
 Okay.
 Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
 I dont know. I think so.
  Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
 Thank you so much.
 Mmm.
  Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if theres any other questions that you have...
 All right. All right. Bye.
 And have a good elevator ride.
 Oh, whats that out there?
 I dont know. I dont know. Cant really trust my feelings anymore.
 She suckered you too.
 Was it the cleavage?
 Yep.
 God. She left this here?
 Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
 Yeah. This could be a signal. People dont just take barrettes off.
  Well...
 Yeah, I know. I know.
 I know. Youre right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
||
 Oh. Youre still here. I have your baguette.
 You know what? Everybody told me that you werent interested. Everybody. And I didnt believe em. And they were right. So... theres your barrette.
 Who?
 About what?
 No, no. No.
 No...
  What happened?
 Really?! Oh, thats great. Thats such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed.
 No, Im serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
 You know what? It doesnt matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!
 Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
 Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
 Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! Theyre going great. I, uh... were just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. Im actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
 Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
 Okay.
 Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
 Yeah, well, Stanley doesnt help with anything. Come on. Shout em out, shout em out.
 Oh!
 Thats fun.
 All right.
 We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Changs.
 Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
 You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldnt see.
 You guys think Donnas cheating on me?
 ... and... we had sex, too.
 How?
 How do I not make any more of it?
 All right.   And she wont say, "I love you."
 Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
 Yeah, she does all that.
 No, no...
 Run what?
 Why didnt you just say that, Pam?
 Well, thats easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. Its stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
 Yes, Jim, I do. And I cant stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
 Thats what makes it so wrong.
 Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, thats whats killing me.
  I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
 This is you. How much do you charge?
 Ill give you $50. Moneys no object.
 Okay.
 Its never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didnt have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
 Its comfort food, all right?  God.
 I know. Well, I hope youre right. Well see what Dwight says.
 Because I have him investigating her. Im waiting for a text update.
 Its too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
 God, this is so disgusting.
 I know.
 Thats not true.  Youre right, I ruin everything. And Ive known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
 Helene?
 Oh.
 Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
  All right.
 Youre back. What happened?
 No, what happened with Donna?
 Ugh!
 No. No! Are you sure?
 Who eats eight protein bars?
 Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
 What? No, she didnt say that.
 I am not paying for that membership.
  Ohhh... mmm...
 No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
 Thats her?
 Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, Ill talk to you later.
 I didnt. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
 Ye... pfff. Well, no. Its a lie. Thats not what happened. I just like you. I cant believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
 If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
 Well, you are boner-ific.
 ...poop my pants.
 Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
 We are?
 Wow.  Thats exciting.
 Hey.
 Well it can wait. It can wait.
 Jim is her husband.
 And they are having problems, so sh...
 Good in bed.
 Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
 Okay, weirdo.
 Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
 Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
 God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
 Im gonna kill him. No, Im not. I feel... I... no, Im not going to kill him.
 I have to hear it from her.
 I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
 I need to have her say...
 I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
 No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
  Okay. Okay. Okay.
 You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
 Wouldnt that be fun?
 How about Thursday?
 I cant do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
 Oh, really? cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. Itd be a great, great concert.
 Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
 Nope, thats Tuesday.
 Youre cheating. Youre cheating on me.
 Pam told me.
 Who is he?
 The other man. Whos the guy? Who is it?
 Im the mistress?
  Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured Id rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.
  Pfffffttt.
  Youre kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
  You know what? Were not gonna die of radon, were gonna die of boredom.
  Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
  Okay, alright.
  I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
  Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
  I dont know.
  Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
   Toby, just do it! God!
  Good work.
   Morning everyone.
  Hello!
  Oh, thank you. Its reversible, I think.
  Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles flavors? Cake it to the Limit. Thats my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
  Okay. Well... thats random. I will dig into those later.
  No, I gotta go. Text me later.
  Hey.
  Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
  That... exists?
  Okay, well, Ill have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
  Okay, Pam... shes not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
  Since when is this an office where we delve into each others personal lives?
  I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, its wrong.
  Well, I think we all know what youre capable of Meredith.
  People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
  I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
  He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
  Im sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
  On her diet! Hes a sports guy. Hes scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
  Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
  You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
  Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
  Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think hes an angel? I dont think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
  I am Beyonce always.
  Yes, I am.
  I would love that.
  I have work to do.
  Lets go.  I cant wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what hes making me do to her.
  All right, Andy, please.
  Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. Thats him. Thats him.
  Right there. The coach!
  Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
  All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
  You have no idea what youre talking about.
  You dont. No, no.
  You dont know. You dont-- you dont know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didnt even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet its like, "Hey, Donna, why dont you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why dont you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. Im taking all the credit."
  Okay, well, thats because hes paying their salary.
  I know, I know, I know. It--Im--it-- that was a euphemism.
  Shh! Okay, all right. Dont, dont.
   Okay.
  No. God. You go talk to him.
  No, no, no.
  Im good. Oh, my God.
  Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
  Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My hearts still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "Im sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin Bond.
  Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
  Dont thank me. Thank Dylans mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
  You love it. There ya go.
  Uh, no, they didnt say team. They just said coal Hawks.
  Well, then it wouldnt be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
  I did.
  No. We just talked. Hes very nice.
  It did not.
  Isnt it?
  Im awful, arent I?
  Im an awful guy! Ooh!
  I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when Im hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
  I dont care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. Thats Lemon.
  Youll learn, baby. Youll learn.
  Yeah, I noticed that.
  Nope.
  I have got big balls.
  Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, thats...  All right, all right. You know what? Im sick of this. Im sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think thats going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
  Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that were into isnt very condo-appropriate.
  Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
  Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
   How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And Im a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do whats right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
  Yes?
   Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
  Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? Whats going on?
  There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
 OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
 Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. Im like, what? All right. So I do it. Its on TV last night. And its in the paper today. And its online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. Its like, come on, people, enough.
 Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
 Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
 Yes.
 Yes. Come on! Get it up! Thats what... lets do it!
 Please.
 Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. Its not even that interesting a baby otter, it cant even stand up.  Its trying to stand up...  there it goes.
 Jo! We were not expecting you!
 Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
 Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
 There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
 Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
 Okay.
 We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
 Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
 I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. Id prefer it if they died, cause its not right.
 Okay.
 Ridiculous, Angela. And like Im going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
 Is there something that you would like to say to me?
 About talking to the press?
 Mmhmm.
 I dont believe you.
 Thats a little much. All right, all right, all right.
 Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
 Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
 Oh, no, no, no...
 Oh my god. Was she cute?
 Oh, god, Darryl!
 I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now hes probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I dont know what is.
 You leaked it?
 I dont know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
 Oh.
 Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
 So see you in Merediths van in five minutes.
 No, you know whats messed up? This situation all up in here is whats messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
 What do we got?
 Its okay, shes cool, she also whistle-blew.
 Hey, hey, its as interesting as a morgue.
 Okay, heres what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
 No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
 Just dont say no.
 Thats just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, lets just...
 Okay. You can count on me.
 Hey Jo.
 I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make em come to work, and we work em, and we make em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay em but we make em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, its Christmas, but right after theyre back in the thick of it.
 What?
 It doesnt matter what I know.
 Why?
 Well, deal with this.
 What?
 Are you going to kill me?
  Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
 I have rights.
 I am not going to tell you anything.
 Well, Im going through a little bit of a rough patch.
 Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
 And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
 Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. Its not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
 Hmm, hmm.
 You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
 I, I surely do, and dont call me honey.  You were playing too.
  We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
 That was fun.
 Thanks. Today helped.
 Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
 I suppose summer had to end sometime. Its sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw Inception. Or at least I dreamt I did.
 Hes not the worst, okay? Hes not the worst. You know whos the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! Its not cappuccino.
 Its just coffee, guys! But, yeah, Ill look into it, okay?
 Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
 To get some ice cream for everybody. Its national ice cream afternoon. Great.
 And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
 Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of Ace Ventura II and that was 95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
 Dont bother Luke.
 That means dont. Havent you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
 No, it... Yes, okay, right.  All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.
 Come on. Okay, um...  Thats as clear as I can make it.
 Because I dont want it getting back to Sabre that were yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
 Nope, it wont be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
 Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
 No. No, Toby. Hes not. Yes he is. Hes my nephew.
 Luke is my nephew.
 Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
 Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldnt even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
 God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
 Thank you.
 No! No. Im just saying, why does God get to do something that I dont?
 Well, then, why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad? You just want me to fire Luke. Thats reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
 Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, its in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And Id point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I dont want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
 Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
 Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
 All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
 Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
 Im reconsidering sending them back anyway.
 Wait a minute.
 Dont-all right. Well, ok, youve just committed a felony.
 No, I know they fit. Its not about the fit.
 Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
 You dont have all the facts.
 I love him.
 No. No. Hes my nephew.
 Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
 I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
 Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and hell slow down, and Ill push him again. Thats the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. Its all about give and take, but mostly its about pushing each other.
 Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscars head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
 Give me the pointer.
 No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angelas boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
 Okay.
 All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So were starting with account setup-
 Okay, can I have that?
 Ok, I am going to count down from five.
 Im not kidding.
 Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
  You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
 Thats what youre going to do, Luke!
 I had to do that.
 All right. Are we good?  Youre okay. Hes okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
 Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
 Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldnt. These things seldom work out. I dont know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think theyd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hats off to them.
 Thats it? Really? Thats nothing. All right. Thats highway robbery.
 I can do that.
 Okay. Wait, what?
 Is there another option?
  This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
  Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. Its over. Its done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
  I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?"
  So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I dont think so. Were going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. Thats the key.
  One hour.
  One hour. Weve done one hour. Lets just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
  No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
  You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
  Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
  Toby, can I really tell you anything?
  Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think hes a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
  And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?
  Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. Were half way done.
  This is plenty complicated.
  Ive played it once or twice with Jeff.
  Jeff was my mothers boyfriend, who she married.
  Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
  Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasnt able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
  I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
  I guess thats why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
  Right. Why would a dog do that? Thats silly.
  When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But Ive never said it out loud, so...
  Well, lets not get too... This isnt a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
  You. Bitch. God! Youre very helpful arent you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
  You are good. But you know what? You cant help people. You couldnt help your marriage. You lose. I dont need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You cant help anybody. I dont need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
  Ok.
  Youll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.
  You forged them! You forged the forms!
  Yes.
  Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
  You dont make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing Im here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!"  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Lets do it to it!
  That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
 Really? They didnt call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
 Andy, what times the show?
 How long is it?
 Nope, cant make it.
 They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andys play, they took mine.
 I cant Andy, its too hard. Thats-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
 Wow.
 I wish I could, Andy, but I cant. I have plans that night. Im going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. Youre that friend. Im going to see your play.
 And scene.
 Oh, hey guys.
  I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
 Yes.
 Nope.
  This is ridiculous. Youd think theyd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
 No, Darryl. This guys a world-class actor. He doesnt daylight as your plumber.
 Are you kidding me?
 All right, Im sorry. God.
 Hello.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yes.
 Good.
 You enjoy the second act.
 Thank you. You, too.
 How is that funny?
  Boo! Boo!
 Mmm! Fruit is so much better when its dried. Ive already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
 Yeah, good job. Well done.
 Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasnt one of em.
 Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
 Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didnt think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
 That would never happen.
 Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
  I dont like that at all.
 Hey, whats going on here? Post-show blues?
 Yeah, I get those every day after work.
  Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
 I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
 I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
 Come on, Andy, seriously.
 In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  Im just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyones tightening their belts in this economy.  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasnt a victim, if you know what Im talkin about.
 No, that was- Im just getting into the first act.
 There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
  Look,  Its a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
 You mean cancer?
 It is?
 Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I dont have acne. I have a cold sore. I dont even have a cold. I dont know how I got it.
 How?
 What?
 Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
 No! It was like four years ago!
 Why at least? If youre guessing forty six just say forty six.
 How did this happen, how did I get this?
 You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  Its me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
 Dont even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
 Oh my God! What if I did?
 Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
 Theres no way Im gonna do that.
||
 Hi Donna. Its Michael.
 I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
 I cant even say it. H-I...
 ...R-P-E-E-S
 No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
 Does your stupid husband have it?
 Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
 No this is Holly.
 No this is Holly.
 Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
 Oh really? Was anyone killed?
 Any nuns?
  Were they in the missionary position?
  Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadnt been transferred?
 We would have twins.
 Mmhmm!
 Mhhmm! We would be married.
 Do what?
 I dont romanticize th-  No...
 He had no arms or legs, he couldnt hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
 We were more than we were.
 Ok, alright I gotta go.
 It didnt come up organically.
 Its nice to see you doing so well.
 Bringing home the bacon.
  Would you excuse us...
 He hasnt changed.
 Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
 What?
 Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
 Because we work together.
 Am I the princess?
  Ok, so Im the guy at the station.
 I have herpes.
 I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
 You know, I dont know if I trust Jans judgment. She...
 No, Im not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
 Yes, I dont...
 I know, I know.
 Got it.
 IM TRYING! GOD!
  Hi stranger! Long time!
 Im Michael. We dated for a while.
 Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
 Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
 Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
 Jerk.
 Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
 Carroll, how are you?
 Im great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, Im going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
 No.
 Weird...
 He sounds like a nice guy.
 Oh wow another living room!
 You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
 Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
 I have herpes.
 I just found out today. Its, uh, right there.
 Mmhmm, Im sorry.
 Im between specialists right now.
 Well I believe in love at first sight.
 I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
 Hi Holly its Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. Its just. You know?  Its weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? Youre wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I dont feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didnt joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I dont know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
 Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
 You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
 Herpes duplex.
 I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
 Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
 Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
 An electric car dealership.
 Oscar! Think abou- Think!
 Look at that.
 Nice!
 She is a beaut!
 Oh, look at that.   Smooth roll.
 Oh, god!
 Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
 I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
  Oh, my god!
 Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
 Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
 Oh, hey. No, Im not busy. Whats up?
 Its Jim, Okay? Yes.
 You need the big guns, yes?
 I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
  No, I dont have time for this. Are you kidding me?
 No! Okay.  All right.
 Oh, no, thats a male model.
 That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
 Nice to meet you.
 Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
 All right.
 Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
 Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, its showtime. Ready, one, two--
 Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
 Its showtime! Oh...never mind. Lets go.
 When I knock on your door, you know who it is; its Michael Scott. Weve been together forever and we-
 You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. Were going to deliver to you on weekends.
 And you know what else were gonna do? I cant believe Im gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so youd better shake my hand right now.
 Shake it, shake it!
 Okay. Thank you.
 Thanks, Steve.
 Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesnt even close the door?
 How do I feel about losing the sale? Its like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
 You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? Theyre a small company. Theyre smaller than we are. Whats our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
 Okay. You know what? You clearly dont care, so why dont you just leave?
 Why dont you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
 I dont know, your frame, your build-why dont you have a glass of apple juice and tell me youre not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
 Oh, my god!
 You know what this is? This is a stinger.
 Like the movie.
 Paul Newman, Robert Redford. Theyre bank robbers.
 Shhh! Hey! Thats my mug.
 Yes.
 Oh, no, no. No. Dont-
 Testify.
 Yeah, he is that good-looking.
 Okay.
 Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin at him.
 Oh...my god! Hes making her sell to him.
 Stay-
 Oh!
 Dont let us down.
 No, no, no....
 Im goin in!
 Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
 I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
 Dont! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
 I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
 A surveillance room next to this one.
 Yes. And its the sincerest form of flattery.
 Well-
 Okay. You know what, it wasnt just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
 No, we dont. Heres-heres my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
 You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
 So, you will?
 Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
 Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
 I know, I know.
 Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
 I can give you more money-theres your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-theres your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
 Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
 O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
 No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
 No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
 Yes.
 No, you may not.
 I said no.
 Were not-
 Okay. Lets-all right, all right. Lets talk. Please dont let him leave.  Dont leave. Dont let him.
 Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
 Okay. Well...get ready, cause its gonna get better.
 No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He cant now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, hes going to steal sales for us.
 He doesnt need to sit, hes a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
 Good-bye!
 This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we dont even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
  All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
 A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  Six seconds, MacGruber!  Pams got a lot of fun stuff planned!  Uh, two seconds MacGruber!  Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION!  MACGRUBERRRR!
 MACGRUBER!
 Oh, here we go!
  OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
 So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
 Blackula!
 Oh, so... I almost forgot. Youll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. Thats like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
 Yeah. Im sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
 Really? Were good?
 Okay.  Okay.
 Oh. Its a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
 Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what Id like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what theyre missing.
 Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
 Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
 You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
 Yeah, I bet it is! If youre gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
 This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbins. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
 I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I dont care if I take a bullet. Were gonna call them, were gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
 And we are going to straighten this out.
 Mmhm!
 Im a little peeved at Darryl right now.
 No, he didnt go behind my back. He went over my head.
 What is taking someone from behind?
 It was a good idea, though.
  What the hell are they talking about?
 Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I dont- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? Thats inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
 Oh, youre sorry?
 What did you just thought?
 All right.
 Okay.
 Well, dont let it happen again.
 I-
 Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. Thats not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
 You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
 Okay, that might help. If you said "Im sorry" in front of everybody.
 In front of me.
 So thats it.
 Is it?
 Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, its cool, man, I work in the warehouse! Im cool! Im hip and Im jive! And I dont care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
 Still dont know who I am? Ill give you a hint. I go over other peoples heads.
 Whats a bad idea?
 NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine.  Im not Darryl. And thank God Im not Darryl.
 Hey, can I play? Why dont you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
 Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
 Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
 If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
 Thank you.
 If theyre good ideas, Im not gonna say no!
 That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
 Oh...
 Well...
 Stop it! Stop, stop. Were thinking. Were thinking about it.
 You dont have to point to the fact that were thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
 I am not budging on the hat issue.
 Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
 Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then well give her a call.
 Sorry I was a jerk.
 Friends fight. Friends fight.
 Thats true, thats true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
  Um... kay. Uh, alright.
 Top of the Sunday morning to you.
 Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.
 I invited everyone in the office because its not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
  Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you cant refuse. Scooch over.
 But Im the Godfather.
 Are you talking to me?
 Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
 Yeah.
  Im not the godfather.
  So who is the godfather?
 Okay. Old friend, like, youve known him since kindergarten?
 No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
 I dont even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And thats not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
 Good morning.
 Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. Its as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. Thats great, because, you know, the paper industrys not gonna last forever.
 Good morning.
 Good morning.
  How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
 I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
 Oh, after you.
 No, I insist. After me.
 Thank you. You too.
 You know what, guys, lets just enjoy lunch.
 Shh.
 No.
  Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
 Are you kidding me? Stop it.
 Shh.
  Look at that. Look at that. Thats fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Lets go help Africa. Lets go build an airport. Well start small. Well have a car wash. Well send some cheerleaders to regionals.
 Yeah, well, thats just a pick-up scene. Okay, we dont have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
 Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
 Well, its, its-
 No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? Whats so great about your lives that you think youre better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? Youre mean. Youre mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you dont stop worrying so much about what youre gonna put in your gullet, youre gonna die in about a month.
  Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. Were proud of you.  Bye. Okay.
  Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
  Ill take a shirt.
 If youll have me, yes.
 Really?  Thank you. All right.
 No, Im not. Im staying on the bus. Im already on the bus. Im going.
 It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
 You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
 Hey, right?
 Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
 Tell them that Im in a meeting.
 No, you may not.
 Thank you.
  See you in a few months.
 Mm. Thats not gonna happen.
 Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
 How long till we get to Mexico?
 Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
 Why arent they building it themselves?
 Do we know how? I dont know how. You know how?
 Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
 What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
 Oh, God, you know what? Im gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
 And Cinco de Mayo.
 No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums havent even started. Now were those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
 Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
 Do that. Do it.
  Okay, driver, driver, if youre not gonna stop this bus, then Im going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.
 Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
 Stop the bus, okay?
 I didnt sign up for this. You guys are young, thats great. You want to give back to society. Ive done that. I need to take.
 Blah-di-blah!
 We could go back and forth all day. Its not gonna solve anything.
 Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you dont. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
  Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. Well keep an eye on America for you.
 Why quick?
 Is anyone still at the church?
 What? Shut up.
 It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
  They have him surrounded. Its the SWAT. The SWATs arriving.
 Ok, thats our street! Thats our street! Hes going down our street!  Come on everybody!
  There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!
  Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught?  Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And Ill tell you what.  You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
 Walk with me.
  Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
 Dwight! Sign please. I dont have time for parties I dont have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
 Cancel it! Are you still here?
 MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? Im a very busy man. I dont have time for your TV show.
 Im joking.
 Im joking. Im kidding around! Im not actually angry.  Im not busy at all, Im not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, Im a total Gleek.
 You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
 Kevin!
 Yes, I am. Are you?
 What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
 Why did you just say he was the boss?
 Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
 Uh huh...
 Big...
 All right!
  Okay okay okay.
 Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So Ill get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it Im ready for bed!
||
 Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.
 Wheres Michael? Wheres Michael? We cant start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
 Actually I think its not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
 Well some of us are trying to have a...
  Well I will turn up the volume.
 Okay...  Heeeeres what were gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
 Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until Im dead. Okay?
  Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
 Yeah, well I wasnt very hard to find.
 Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
 So these are pizza dogs, they arent pigs in a blanket per se.
 Well...
 Hes the longest baby in this room.
 You know what Erin you do have to.
  Thats what she said.
  Okay... Alright.
 I just went out for a walk.
 What? Really? That stinks!
 What does that mean? Partys over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
 Are you kidding me?
 Now thats going on?
 Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I dont know if its gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, Im gonna give it shot.
 No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
 What is there to like? Hes just, hes a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
  If you break that girls heart, I will kill you. Its just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girls heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
 Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girls gonna turn my hair gray.
  My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
 Uh... try "password".
 Uh... it was like eight years ago?
 Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been...  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
 You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
 The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
 Morning.
  Im Facebook.
 I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still havent heard anything back.
 A what?
 Dot com!
 I think an investors ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
 I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because Ive never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
 Your kidding?!
 You and me.
 Dont you work here full-time?
 Mm-Hmm.
 That does sound fun to me.
 Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention...
 MONEY!
 Pervert.
 Thats good to know.
 Wuphf! All right, Ive warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
 Whoo!
 We already have a buyer.
 At least.
 Thats right!
 Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
 No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
 Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
 There you go.
 Do not talk like that, Stanley.
 Here we go.
 "Its Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
 "Hes up there."
 Look at that! He threw em on the ground!
 No, its not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
 I wont sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isnt that right?
 I--yes. Were not selling. I will not sell.
 Cant talk, saving the planet.
 We Dont? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
  Eight Years.
 No, I wont even consider it.
 Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
 I think you are wrong.
 You may be right. I may be crazy.
 Im just saying that I think I agree with your point.
 I thought it might make me feel better.
  But it just may be a lunatic...  No.
 Good, good, bro.
 Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
 Nine days, though. Thats, like...
 Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
 Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
 So you would think thats a good idea for me to do?
 Mm-Hmm.
 Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
 Tonight?
 Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
 Hello.
 I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
 Im not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And hes also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesnt, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
 Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybodys money.
 You cant have it.
 The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that youre dealt.  Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. Thats easy. Gimme a hard one. Thats what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pams a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So...  Thats Uh...
 Thank God.
  Mmhmm, China. China.
 It was great. China.
 Everything here was made in China, Pam.
 They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But were falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
 Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?
 I found that in the waiting room at the dentists office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, thats the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
 My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
 What?
 So much for keeping our secrets up high.
 I know what were going to do. Were going to put our best minds on it.
 Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
 Welcome to your future.
 How do we stop it? With a big idea. Thats what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
 Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
 Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
 I dont know.
 Alright.
 I dont know what the  that was.
 No hes not right. Were not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
 No, no. That is right now.
 In terms of land, not population.
 No, no youre wrong about this.
 I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
 So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what?  I dont care.
 Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
 Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
 Very comedically humorous Jim.
 Try Control P.
 Not if the printer isnt hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
 Hey.
 Mmm.
 Yeah.
 Sure.
 Coffee Jim.
 Yes.
 Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I dont have time. Okay, okay, Ill just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
 Im pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California."  What?
 Pass.
 Pass.
 Lifeline.
 I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
 Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
 Is it going to be worth it?
 I dont need to cheat.
 Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
 Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, thats just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
 China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
 How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
 Dont... I...
 Yeah, I figured that.
 Wait. You forgetting something?
 This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
 Here we are.
 My point is... that as long as people like you and me dont stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
 I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I dont think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you dont, thats fine. That my friend, is your victory. Yknow, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they dont tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
 Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
 People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. Were gonna do a fun one.
 Thats it! Thats a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. Were gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
 Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
 Dont answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where were all in the air at the same time. Yes?
 I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
 We didnt get it.
 Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!
 Hows everybody doing today?
 Hows the party coming along?
 Are we over budget?
 No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
 Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. Whats the problem?
 So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
 Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
 Whatcha got?
 Well, thats a relief. Santas gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
 My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because thats what I want. Thats what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
 Yeah!
 Pam? Pam?
 Hi.
 Uh, because youve been on the Lam? Because the boring police have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
 Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
 You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
 That was the worst joke ever.
 Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
 What? What?
 Hold on, Hollys coming back here?
 That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
 Hollys coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
 You know what, well postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
 Cancel. Were canceling it.
 No, we have to cancel the party.
 No, no, no, were gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
 I know.
 Its not. Theyre not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
 Well then everybodyll chip in, itll be fine.
 You know what, Ill pay for it. Ill pay for the party. It doesnt matter. This is way too important. People, Hollys coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
 Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more persons breath away.
 We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but theyve never been cool.  The name is Bond... Santa Bond. Ill have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody cant get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. Hes not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!
 Well, this years gonna be different. Were gonna have fun. Its not gonna be tacky. Its going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. Its not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. Its gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
 Okay. Sure.
 You never know about the press.
 Could he help us with some parking tickets?
 Well, then hes not a senator.
 Okay.
 Okay...  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
 Pam, no, no. Hollys coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks its a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
 Yes, thats me. Come on it.
  Theres nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, whats better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
 When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
 She doesnt need an internet presence, you just know.
 What the hell are you doing here? Youre supposed to be in the courthouse.
 And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
 There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for Gods sake?
 Hello.
  Well, I never thought Id see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
  Why, youre some sorta wise guy, huh?
 Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
  Doh!
 Hi. Hi. Oh...
 Oh no, not the huggy monster! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die! I dont wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
 Thats adorable.
 Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
 Isnt it wonderful? We love it here. Dont you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.
 What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
 This is weird. I cant believe youre here. This feels like you never left. Doesnt it?
 Oh...
 Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy...
 Well, thats understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
 You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andys mom.
 Because without Andys mom, theres no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
 Youre kidding me. Ahh!
 What a douche bag!
 Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
 Mmhmm.
 Good for him.
 Really? Thats creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
 Oh, you do?
  Yeah, Randy Newmans the best.
 Me too.
 Hey.
 Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. Im Santa Claus. Welcome.
 Its a sophisticated take.
 Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
 Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
 I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you dont. And thats just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.
 What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
 All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
 I havent told you about her.
 Im a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think thats pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
 I do. She is.
 Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it aint Tara.
 What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting.
 Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isnt that nice? Thank you very much.
 It is Christmas.
 Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
 Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
  I dont. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
 All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didnt mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
 Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. Thats what Jim and Dwight thought.
 When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I cant do this." But then, with this other guy, you dont have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
 And we did this whole stupid party for you.
 Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
 Hey
 Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
 Good trip down?
 Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
 I am dead inside.
 Oh, hey, hey, no, dont run. Youre gonna slip.
 Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
  Yeah, well, at least he was married.
 No, its not. Its not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
 Really?
 No.
 Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I dont want you to fall.
 I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
 No, thats not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
  From the mall. That...
 Well, that...
 Hey.
 Oh.
 Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
 Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didnt he say that?
 I think I know where he is.
 Mmhmm.
 Video games.
 A DSi?
 A horse.
 You, are you sure you dont want a pony? You want a real horse?
 All right. You have to pick up after them.
 January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, lets switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, lets push through. Well do this.
 Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Years or they break up. Now, if shes engaged, Im gonna go crazy, and Im gonna start attacking people. If shes not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
  Michael, I know what youre thinking. Hollys engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but its not.
 Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
 Happy.
 Sad. To soak up my tears.
 Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
 Sad, something to break.
 For you, job well done.
 Both sad.
 I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Hollys favorite. I hope she doesnt call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I dont know. "Whats your name?" Michael.
 Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
 So... high five me. Were back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
 Theyre so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! Thats a good firm handshake. Youre hired! Yes, lets get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
 Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
 Oh my God! Thats it! Thats it!
 Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
 Im trying!
 Im trying!
 What?
 Im not listening to music!
 Go! Oh, thats nice.
 Me? Okay.
 Im good.
 Oh my God!
 Hello! Oh, somebodys got a new phone!
 That is neat.
  E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
  Why?
  Bummer.
  Reeses Pieces.
 I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
 Holly doesnt seem to be engaged, but shes talking to AJ like she is. I cant figure it out. Do you think shes already dating a different AJ?
 When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
 But you did still love him.
 Do you love him now?
 No. Shed just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
 You think shed talk to you?
 Thats true. Shes really nice. Shed talk to anybody. Why dont you bring Erin to balance you out?
 Or sooner.
 Thats not a joke.
 Is it?
 Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 1201, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
 What is wrong with you people? Cant you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothings stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
 Youre just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know whats going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
 Just do a cartwheel!
  Eat it.
 No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
 Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
 I dont care whether you hate it! You said youd do it!
 Eat it!
 All right, all right, shh!
 Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
 No! You cant have any candy!
  Holly Flax.
  Not Michael, E.T.
 Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
 Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
 And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
 It was insensitive and I am sorry.
 I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
 Youre right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
 Okay, oh! All right.
 Okay.
 No.
 Yup.
 You can toss them.
 My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless its from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
 Look at where youre going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where youre going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
 You ready to do this?
 You know what? Im going to stay here as long as it takes.
 Its about you. Its about you. Go!
 You did?
 Okay.
 Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
  Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
 English?
 Oh no no, Im not picking on you at all. Youre English, correct?
 Im working on an English character. Would you mind gi...  Its called Reginald Pooftah.
 Michael Scott.
||
 I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
 No, no, no. And people dont understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
 Thats good. Pleasure to meet you.
 Dunder Mifflin.
 No, not right now.
 All right. See you around.
 Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
   Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
 Nein! Im greek! My name is Mikanos.
 Okay.
 I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
 You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
 Okay.
 Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, its been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? Thats what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
  If-a you change-a you mind, why dont you talk to Mikanos?
 Ugh. Youre the fifth person to tell me that today.
 Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
  Practice Olympics.
  I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
  Hello.
 She will have a greekaccino.
 It...
  I cant believe-ee. Its a miracle. She can talk!
 No more brain damage!
  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. Im going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since its a secret, and Ill tell you.   All, you have to close right now.
 No, youre not. Youre getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
 Andy, whats the problem?
 You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Dont let them down. Dont let yourself down, Andy. Im gonna go back in. Im going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?
  No, no, no.
  Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
 What? Come on. Its time for grapes.  Real fun day.
 Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
 You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
 I dont understand. I really dont. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
 Sure we do.
 Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
 Yeah, I understand. I just dont agree.
 Yes I do.
 Yes I do.
 I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
 Lets go.
 Lets go!
 Just drive faster. I want to get back.
 Okay, fine. My feelings dont matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
 No Im not. Im not in a bad mood. Im not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Lets just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?
 I need to pee.
 Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
 What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? Im upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
 Well I hope I make it.
 I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isnt here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
 There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. Hes my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
 Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you dont have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
 You know what, I can dial 411, get Jims number.
 Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, thats enough. Ok.
  Hey you guys. Listen to me. Dont get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. Youre so colorful. I wish I could understand you. Thats a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. Youll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  Im being serious. Seriously.
 Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I dont have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
 Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
 With that I can buy... half the menu.
 All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you dont sell?
 Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why dont you just throw one away now into my mouth?
 Okay. Youve just lost my business.
 Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
 Okay. Ill be right back. . Okay. You know what? Im sorry. Im sorry. I dont have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I cant do that to you fine people.
 Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
 Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
 I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. Ill be back later with the money. Im just gonna leave right now.
 Well, I think I can get through the door.
 Hi.  How did you know I was up here?
 I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
 Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much.
 Really?
 Can I kiss you?
 Okay.
 Miss you. Okay. Ill be in my office if you need me.
 Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
 Dont go. I dont want you to go. Oh dont go. Dont go.
 Holly and I are dating. Its been a week, and I still cant believe it.  It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you cant work for it. It just comes to you.
  Are these numbers correct?
 Okay.
 Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? Cause youre grossing me out.
 Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.
 Oh, yeah.
||
  Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
 Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
 What, are you talking about me and Holly?
 Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
 I... Okay, yeah, thats pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
 Thank you.
 All right.
 Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
 You win. But heres what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
 Anything goes.
 Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, were gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
 Pro.
 What? Problem solved.
 No, no, its great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
 Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing its working.
 Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I dont... I dont sit on your lap because its comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
 Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then well stop.
 Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
 Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentines Day.
 I love you.
 I love you-love you.
 I am really disappointed in the offices policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
 Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
 Hello, Holly.
 Here, shake. No!
 No, we cant.
 No touching. Ah, Im trying not to touch you.
 Oh.
 Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we cant do that. We cant do this. Ohh.
 I dont know what your body feels like cause I cant touch it.
 Grab you here.
 I will grab you here anyway.
 Never.
 I did say I would, but I was wrong. I cant stop. You dont what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
 Yes, it was that. Its that one.
 Were not supposed to PDA.
 I havent thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
 Thats what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. Hows this gonna be any different?
 I was in love with you.
||
 Its like a time bomb...
 ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
 Sexual time bomb.
  Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
 No.  Saving the world has never been this hard.
 No, I cant talk to her. I cant even look at her without thinking about it ending.
 Do the monkey face.
 I love that. I love that face.
 No. The monkey!
 Dont do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
 Thats good.
 Thats good. Hes throwing it.
 I know.
 Holly. Hey.
 Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
 Actually, its Valentines Day. Shouldnt be doing this today. Ill talk to you tomorrow.
 Youre gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I cant handle it. So lets just...lets...
 Who?
 Okay. Okay.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay!  Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
 Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentines Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
 I do.
 What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
 After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight.
 Erin... what are you doing?
 Thats... Thats. Well, dont put words in my mouth.
 Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
 Mhmm! Its got action, its got heart, its got some bosom.
 Its got a lot of me.
 Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level Midnight.
 Dwight does not play a robot.
 By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
 That was not scripted.
||
  Well thats a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
 Okay.  No, its not good enough. Its not good enough...
 Hey.
 Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says its great!
 Did you? What did you love about it?
 No, no. Holly, this isnt Oceans Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and dont care about how it turns out. Whatd you really think, honestly.
 Is it, is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
  It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you dont think its great than youre basically saying that you dont believe in my dream.
 I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I couldve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
 Because, if I dont have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
 I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
 Yeah, youre a real pain in the ass. And Im gonna go watch the movie with people who think its great! And Im sorry I called you a pain in the ass, Im angry, and I love you.
 I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although Ive only seen Antz, but Ill tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bugs Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bugs Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, dont listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
 Who likes Threat Level Midnight?  Okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
 We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
 No, no! Actually its really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. Thats why there were so many people there.
 Hey...
 No its not.  Its not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
||
 Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
 Oh yeah!  Yes he is!
 No, no Dwight. Hes just being stupid.
 Still not seeing the problem here.
 It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look whos here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
 Hi.
 Oh, Michael! Thisll be just us.
 Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, hes at his funniest when youve given him five shots.
 And it also helps if youve had five shots.
 Whoa!
 Is Packer here?
  Dont know, dont care.
  Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldnt be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
 You did! You got burned, because Packers back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although hes probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
 Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
 And I dont have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we cant just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
 So you wouldnt mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.
  Lets look at this.
 Dont be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
 No!
 Best day ever. Best day ever!
 Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
 Please.
 Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
 No. Not me, him.
 Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think hes funnier than you? Oh honey...
 Hes funnier than me.
 So Im less funny than not funny at all?
  Uhm...
 Thats insane!
 And you made Hank smile, that doesnt happen often. Youre very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
 I dont know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
 Yeah.
 I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
 Youve been on the road a long time. And youve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you cant be peeing all over the walls.
 No it isnt.
 Yeah, a little bit.
 I wont.
  Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
 Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
 Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldnt be apologizing to Packer. That doesnt make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
 Kevin, do you accept the apology?
 Okay, go back to the annex.
 That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesnt speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parents expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
 I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And were through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
 What are you doing?
 I cannot believe this, youre sending Packer to Florida? Why?
 Okay, so youre tricking him into flying to Florida?
 You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
 He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
 Yes, about that.
 Well... I dont know if thats a good idea.
 No, nothing like that at all.
 Sorry?
  Sounds great.
 That is.  Its gonna be awesome. I think youre really going to enjoy it down there.
 Nah, hes an ass.
  You ahh.
 No you ahh.
  You ahh.
 I uh... I actually dont know why I brought that because Its kind of priceless.
 Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
 500.
 Get lost.
 That is how you do it.
 You know its really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
 In case... in case of what?
 I dont have an in case. Do you have an in case?
 Get lost.
  Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughters boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. Im just kidding. Im kidding. Im actually calling because Im in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isnt a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
 Hi.
 Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think Im gonna run out of gas.
 Well, Im writing a message.
 Im asking Holly a question in fire.
 Maybe.
 Hey you know what? Ive got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
 Pam.
 I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
 No, this is romantic.
 Why?
 I did?
 Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
 Yes.
 I could not have agreed with you more.
 Yes. Thank you.
 No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you cant talk me out of it.
 I had a great idea until you ruined it.
 How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line  I lost my head when I fell in love with you.
 Its easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
 Heres the ring.
 Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
 Is she not going to like that?
 At a gas station?
 That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
 Oh yea you didnt say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
 I just... its terrifying.
 I know but Im still scared I dont know why.
 Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him Dude this was a prop in my movie.
 Ok its because we havent sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and theyre gonna pay anything.
 Oh ok. For how long?
 Is he alright?
 You ok?
 Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
 Ok.
 No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
 No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
 Hey, howd we do?
 Thats great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
 No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
 Shhhh. Lets go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
 So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
 This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Lets go in here.
 This is where we first kissed.
 And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
 Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didnt love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
 In-grown hair.
 Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
 We saved a lot of lives that day. Thats where you first met Michael Klump.
 And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldnt believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
 And over here..
  Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what Id do.
 Lets go in here.
 This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
 That guys got more than he can handle as it is.
 That marriage would be a sham.
 Easy no.
 That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
 Only one that I was kind of worried about.
  This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with..  Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
 Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. Were moving to Colorado.
 Yep.
 Holly has to go back to Colorado. Im going with her. Im leaving.
 Kahlua Sombrero, please.
 Actually, I am meeting somebody, but Im a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
 Oh, really?
 And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
 Do not tell my fiance Im drinking on a Wednesday.
 Im moving out to the burbs... actually, Im moving further than the burbs, Im moving to Colorado.
 Yep. Dont mess with Colorado.
 No, no. I dont want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
 You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
 Thats what Ive heard.
 Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
 Really? What happened?
 Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
 Man, he is late. Im gonna call him. Do you mind? Im sorry.
 No, Im here. Im right... Im at the bar.
 You are? What bar?
 I... do not see you.
 Im been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
 Whatre you wearing?
 Are we both at the right place?
 I hear your voice.
 I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
 Wow... that is insane!
  Here we go! Are you ready?
 Alright! Here we go!
 This is it. What do you think?
||
 Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So, without further ado, lets start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
 Come on out!
 I am well, sir, how are you?
 And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue its Deangelo the whole time!
 I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
 Oh yeah... I know... thats what I was just saying... thats what...
 This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
 Yes it was.
 Are you kidding? Id come anywhere to see a turtle? Whered you find him.
 You know me very well, Dwight.
 Now Im gonna have to go online and look at turtles or Ill be off all day.
 So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
 I sorta like the old way.
 I know, I know, Im sorry, but if its not a big deal we should just-
 Is that good?
 Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
 You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
  Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
 And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
 It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
 Well, we dont really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
 Thats-
 You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You cant say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
 Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you dont even really have to worry about.
 Dont shave my lips.
 You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, lets not go overboard with the re-decorating, and Im still here-
 I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
 Deangelos great. I love the guy. But Im not sure hes a great fit for the office. And also, Im not sure if I love the guy.
  Snack time! Its the witching hour! Its the sandwitching hour!
 PB and J, my moms recipe!
 I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
 What?
 Oscar, here you go.
 No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
 No, thats good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are.
 No, its not insane, Oscar. Im been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, youre gonna throw it all away? No.
 Well, who needs him. Guess its just you and me, Dwight.
 I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, youll be fine.
 Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
 No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
 Youll figure it out.
 It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
 Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
 Why do you always say that? Youre gonna love it.
  Alright lets go!  This way, this way!
 Surprise!
 You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
  Here we go! Have Pam come down.
  Congratulations!
 We got it.
 Yeah thats fine.
  Hey Toby! You suck!
  Go go go go go go!
  Ive never seen this place in the daylight.
 Here we go, alright got it? Set?  Hello?
 Yes you did. Thats right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
  Go.
  Good morning Erin.
 You have big plans for tonight?
 You are getting so funny!  Very good.
 The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didnt just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
 Anything can happen at the Dundies!  Theyre like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
 Black tie optional.
 A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
 Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybodys right. Theyre like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
 So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So Im going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo!
 Think of it as part of your training.
  Okay, well well work on it.
 You are doing it.
  Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
 Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
  Okay, okay. You know what, I didnt actually lose my keys...
 Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now its all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
  There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
 No! God!
 No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
 Jim, please no loopholes.
 This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
 Good. Good. Good!
 Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
  Too personal. I dont wanna hear about it.  Lets try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you cant-  Thats right, youre not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect.
 Say it with an accent!
  The Dundies!
 Im here.  In a good way! Ive been here the whole time.
  DeAngelo, what are you doing? Theres a live audience out there!
 No, Ryan would never do it. Its too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! Its sort of our perk!
 Listen to me, youre not doing this for me, youre not doing this for you, youre not even doing this for them!
  Youre doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kids menu, wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say Its showtime. Get out there.
 Say it.
 You can do it, just say it.
 Now hit me.  One, two, three.
 Alright, here we go.
 Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.
 There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
 Well done.
 Alright.
 Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
 Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldnt be here tonight...
 Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson!  Come on up here you sick bastard.

  There you go.
 It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.
  DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
 Okay, were done! Thats it.
 Were done. Were done!
  So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping itd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
 What?
 No, no. Youre being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
 So what youre saying is you kinda like it?  Ive fallen and I cant get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
 That got a big laugh.
  You were laughing right?
 Were really close.
 Thats true, we wouldnt get seats together.
  You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
 Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
 What is your problem?!
 Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
 He is in an all-out sprint.
  Here...  Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard!

 Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
 I dont own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  The job was not mine to give.  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
 Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
 ...in order to feed the bears.

 Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
 Okay.

 What do you like Pam?
 What kind of toppings would you like?

  I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this.  I still need something to drink out of though.
  Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
 When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is.
 Ahh.

 Youre not gonna lose them.

  Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So thats why I made you this.

 Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
 How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.

  And you, why are you still here.
  No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice?  A little cover-up on your Adams apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.

 Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well theres two things actually.

Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed.  I actually dont understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
  Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh!  This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.  Thats what she said!
 Thats what she said.
  I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. Its every parents dream.
