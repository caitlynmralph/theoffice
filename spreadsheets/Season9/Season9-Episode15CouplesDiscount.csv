Pam|  Hey. I feel so lucky were in the same city for Valentines Day.
Jim| Its like magic. Or, its like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Pam|  Alakazam!
Jim| By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Pam| And, poof! He disappears. 
Erin|  Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
Pete| Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Erin| We can do anything you want.
Erin| I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andys coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. Hes been rude. Hes been selfish. I think hes a big jerk. And Im breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Pete| Erin says shes gonna break up with Andy, but Im not sure. Hes coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever Id like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to send him to a farm. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
Erin|  Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Pete|  Sure. 
Erin| Great.
Pete| Ill get my coat.
Erin| Perfect. 
Dwight|  Come in.
Dwight|  Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
Dwight|  I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
Dwight| I really like Andy these days. Hes pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, were in for an epic, confusing showdown.
Kevin| Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, Ive been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. Its been yummy. But now, Andys coming back. So, I guess its goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Kevin| OK, Ill say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Nellie| I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
Meredith| Yeah, lets get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Phyllis| Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your  boyfriend. But, I mean, if you dont have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Stanley| Phil, Ill pretend to be your husband. Im already sick of you, so itll seem realistic.
Phyllis| Oh...
Angela| They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit.
Kevin|  Ew! Ill be your foot buddy.
Nellie| Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Clark| Its what I do. 
Oscar| Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
Darryl| No... yes, yes. Why wouldnt I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
Oscar| All right, itll be easy. Dont be nervous, just follow my...
Darryl|  Stop talking bout it. I said Im fine with it.
Pam|  These are gross.
Jim| They are terrible.
Pam| Oh, hey, dont fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
Jim| Oh my god. Thats so romantic.
Pam| Its with Brian and Alyssa.
Jim| Oh my god. Thats less romantic.
Pam| I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
Jim| Yeah, yeah. No, totally. Thats good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Pam| That sounds nice.
Jim| Im very excited to see Brian. Brians a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. Im sorry, but you know him. Hes a good guy.
Nail stylist 1| Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper. 
Nail stylist 2|  You take off your glasses.
Clark| Kay. 
Nellie|  What?
Nail stylist 2| Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.
Nellie| My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesnt he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. 
Clark| Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount.  Excuse me.  Full price. Were not together.   
Nellie| Oh, come on!
Clark| Shes living a lie.
Nellie| Turns out, I cant even be in a pretend relationship.
Oscar|  Hi. Wed like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
Nail manager| No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.
Oscar| We are together. Romantically.
Nail manager| Two men?   Doesnt work. No discount.
Darryl| Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And were taking our business elsewhere. 
Jim|  Hey, Brian.
Brian| Hey.
Pam| Sorry were late.
Brian| Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Pam| Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
Jim| What?
Pam| Hes on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
Jim| Oh.
Brian| Its, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
Pam| Yeah.
Jim| Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, Ive wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And Im really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Brian| Its fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, Im fully available.
Pam| Well, my dad cant hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
Brian| Thats... OK, great. Does he pay well?
Pam| Wheres Alyssa?
Brian| Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssas, shes not gonna make it today.
Pam| Oh.
Brian| Actually, were not gonna make it. Um... were splitting up.
Dwight|  I have yet another sales order for you to sign. 
Dwight|  Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I dont know how you do it. Youre a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo. 
Andy|  Hi Dwight.
Dwight| Youre back.  And youre disgusting.
Phyllis|  Ah, geez. My nails arent dry yet. I dont think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Andy| Well, well, well, look who it is. 
Phyllis| Andy.
Andy| I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
Erin| Andy!
Andy| Hey! Sweetheart!  I have missed you so much. 
Erin|  Yes.  Welcome back, buddy.
Andy|  I have been dreaming of this moment.
Erin| Me too. So much. Im so happy.
Erin| I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, Im still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
Oscar| What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Andy| Well, Valentines surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, its a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. Its so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop em. Its called Bembe.  
Dwight| Hey, Burning Man, if its not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Andy| Obviously, thats why Im here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentines Day, sweetheart.  But, Im just saying, Im also excited about the Wallace meeting.
Clark| Why? Isnt he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
Dwight| No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that hes been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that youve been gone for the last three months?
Andy| I have no idea. I dont know what he knows or doesnt know. But weve been in touch the whole time. I mean, its not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. Its in every Bembe cafe.  
Erin| He only emailed me four times.
Andy| Question. Wheres Jim?
Phyllis| He and Pam are having their Valentines Day lunch.
Andy| For two hours? Really?
Oscar| So, youre concerned about peoples long absence from their place of work?
Andy| If the shoe fits. 
Brian| We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
Jim| Well, I mean, thats OK. It doesnt mean that its over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Brian| Yeah. Thats the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasnt until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, its over.  Im sorry, this is... oh my god, OK.  We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
Pam|  Yeah.
Jim| What?
Brian| At least my crying wont get you fired.
Jim| Crying?
Andy| I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. 
Dwight| Thank you.
Andy| And you sold it to Jan too. 
Dwight| Yes!
Andy| I mean... Im impressed.
Dwight|  Yeah!
Andy| Well, theres one problem. Couldnt help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Dwight| You were on a boat.
Andy| I was...
Dwight| On a boat.
Andy|That...
Dwight| In the ocean.
Andy| OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word coolio.
Dwight| Im not gonna say it.
Andy| Say it.
Dwight| Not a word.
Andy| Coolio.
Dwight| No!  What do you think youre doing?
Andy| Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
Dwight| Dont you dare! Andy!
Jan|  Hello?
Andy| Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
Jan| Oh, Andy.
Andy| I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
Jan| Really?
Andy| Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Jan| Hmm.
Dwight|  Coolio.
Jan| Seriously? Youre calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what youre doing?
Dwight| Coolio. Coolio.
Andy| No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood. 
Jan| Yeah.
Dwight| Coolio.
Andy| It, its, its actually just an issue...
Jan| You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
Dwight| No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Andy| Jan, I dont know what hes talking about but...
Jan| Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Andy| Well, ah, ah...
Dwight| Please Ja, Ja... 
Andy| Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
Andy|  Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, were a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Angela| Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you havent been here for 12 Fridays. 
Andy| All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Whos that little fella?
Angela| Its a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded its targets over the past quarter.
Andy| Wow, thats wonderful!
Oscar| A quarters three months. Thats how long youve been gone.
Andy| Uh-huh. 
Angela| Uh-huh.
Andy| Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, were all up to speed.
Dwight| Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
Clark|  Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week. 
Kevin| He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Dwight| God! I just dont know what wed do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Dwight| Id like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, Im a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Nellie| Im not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why dont you?
Meredith| Meredith Palmer aint never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? Thats me. Flesh hoover?
Erin| Hey!
Pete| Meredith, thats plenty. All right? Thats more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
Erin| Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if hes gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I dont want that on my hands. 
Dwight| Fine! The state hes in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
Andy|  Whats going on in here, dirty players? Lets get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Whos that girl? Whos that girl? Its Andy!  All right. Back to work.
Pam| OK, I can tell youre mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I dont know, tell me why? 
Jim| I dont know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I dont know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Pam| I didnt tell you about the crying because I didnt want you to know how upset I was. Because it wouldve stressed you out and youre always saying how much you dont want more stress.
Jim| Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. 
Pam| Its not Brians fault.
Jim| No, youre right. And, and Im not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably dont have any reason to be mad at all because I wasnt there. So, lets just forget about it.
Pam| OK.
Andy| I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Dwight| Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
Andy| Not helpful. Lets stay positive, people. OK?
David Wallace|  Hey guys.
Andy| Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
David Wallace| Sounds great. Dont let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldnt be happier with the numbers.
Andy| Thank you.
David Wallace| Well, finish up. Im gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Andy| Great!
David Wallace|  Great job, everybody!
Andy|  We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
Kevin| You know Pams mural? Well, Frank...
Dwight|   lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.    
Andy| What?! 
Dwight| Yeah.
Andy| There was a fire in the warehouse?
Dwight| The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. 
Kevin| Whoa.
Andy| This is what Im talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
Phyllis| We started selling balloons.
Andy| What?!
Clark| Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Andy| No kidding?
Clark| Yeah. In the European billboards, shes gonna be topless.
Andy| Wow. Go Kathy. Shes like 50.
Clark| Theyre tasteful.
Andy| Good, good. What else?
Andy| Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
David Wallace| What fire?
Andy| The warehouse fire. Werent you just down there? Its like burnt to ashes.
David Wallace| It looked fine to me.
Andy|  I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, thats one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
David Wallace| OK.
Andy| I think youll agree I explained that pretty well. 
David Wallace|  Thanks, Andy. 
Andy| Thank you.
David Wallace| All right. Everyone! 
Erin|  Fish sounds great.
Andy| Yeah, I guess.
Erin| Really playing the scales, huh?
Andy| Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
Erin| I dont love you anymore.
Andy| What?
Erin| I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didnt really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I dont love you.
Andy| OK, I get it. Youre unhappy. Ive been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
Erin| I just said there isnt love.
Andy| On your side. But theres tons on my side. Its gushing. Were just out of sync right now. But thats just timing, its timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
Erin| I guess.
Andy| I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If were lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
Erin| You got really sunburned.
Andy| Im gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
Erin| Ugh.
Andy| I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I wont be able to tell the difference. So, Ill feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, youll actually start to love me again.
Erin| You really think we can get that back?
Andy| Yes.  Come on. Totally.
Jim| You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Pam| Oh?
Jim| Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and Im sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I dont know, drop me at the bus station?
Pam| Are you sure?
Jim| I just feel like were gonna fight.
Pam|  Yeah.    
Jim| So... how bout lets not?
Pam| OK. 
Jim| Oh, um.  Happy Valentines Day. Sorry, I didnt have time to wrap it.
Pam|  Wow. I didnt know you kept this.
Jim| Yeah, yeah.
Pam| Thank you.
Jim| No problem.
Pam| I dont think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.   
Jim| You really wanna fight on Valentines Day?
Pam| Yeah, I do.
Jim| OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Erin| Hi.
Pete| Hey, you OK?
Erin| I couldnt do it.
Pete| Oh.
Erin| Im sorry.
Pete| Oh, you dont have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? 
Erin|  Were breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
David Wallace|  Hey, Andy. Its David. Still here. What was that about three months?
