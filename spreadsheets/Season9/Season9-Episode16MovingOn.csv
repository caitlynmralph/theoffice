David Wallace| ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Andy| I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
David| Really?  â€œHey David, all is good in Scranton PA.â€
Andy| And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
David| â€œBy the way, Oscar says hiâ€
Andy| Oscar says â€œhiâ€ all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. â€œHiâ€ â€œHelloâ€ â€œHolaâ€ Youre telling me youve never heard Oscar say â€œhiâ€?
David| Andy.
Andy| But youre calling me a liar.
David| Andy!
Andy| By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies youve been telling lately.
David| Watch it Andy!
Andy| Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.  â€œHey Andy, alls well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wifes sick.â€ Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
David| My wife?
Andy| This has been a really tough time.
David| Yeah?
Andy| Yeah.
David| Has it?
Andy| Erin just dumped me and I cant remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
David| Shh.
Andy| It was like a security blan-
David| Andy.
Andy| -ket
David| Shh. Im not gonna fire you.
Andy| Youre not?
David| No.
Andy| Thats awesome.
David| I wouldnt own the company if it wasnt for you. So...I owe you that.
Andy| David, Ill be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. Ill be there for you. Thats a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
David| We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Andy| Crystal.
David| You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
Andy| Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
Andy| Good morning.
Erin| Good morning.
Andy| And how are you on this fine- 
Andy|  Ok, we ready?  Dont use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Andy|  Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
Pam| He sounds like a wounded animal.
Stanley| Shouldve put him out of his misery and just fired her.
Phyllis| I cant be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Stanley| Im the same way with horny people.
Pam| Ok. 
Erin| Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesnt know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Petes butt. Its sick.
Pam|  Oh thats mine! Um, Ill just, Ill get it out of the way for you.
Pam| Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. Its um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  Im sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Dwight|  No, dont just let her eat the grass, shell puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. Im sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but shes your aunt too. Fine. Ill see what I can do.
Dwight|  I need you.
Angela| Ahh! Dwight!
Dwight| And you should take breaks more often, Ive been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Angela| What? What is it?
Dwight| Its my aunt Shirley, shes on her last legs.
Angela| Dwight, thats awful.
Dwight| You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, its all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was â€œpoisonedâ€ by Aunt Shirley.
Angela| What do you mean by â€œpoisonedâ€?
Dwight| Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Angela| Ok, well Im very sorry about your aunt.
Dwight| Thank you.
Angela| But I dont see how this is my problem.
Dwight| Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, shes an old woman Angela. She needs a womans touch. Its all hanging out-
Angela| Ugh.
Dwight| And theres parts of her I dont even recognize.
Angela| Gah.
Dwight| Theres this one hanging part in particular, thats some sort of flap.
Angela| Its fine.
Dwight| Its like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Angela| Ugh! God, I cant. OK, Ill-
Dwight| Its a divet...
Angela| Ill help you!
Dwight| ..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Angela| Ugh.
Andy| Where are you going?
Pam| Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
Andy| Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Dwight| How dare you?
Andy| Im still the boss!
Erin| I...
Andy| The answer is yes.
Erin| ..just have some messages for you.
Andy| Are they from you?
Erin| Well no, theyre from clients.
Andy| Well then, I dont want them. You can keep em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
Erin| I cant. I-
Andy| Nope, I insist upon it. Its an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
Erin| These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Andy| I dont want to talk about work right now.
Erin| Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Andy| Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Erin| Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Pete| Ive got the seat adjusted right.
Clark| Perfect height, yeah.
Andy| She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Pete| I was just leaving.
Andy| Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Heres the sitch Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
Pete| I dont know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Andy| Survey says ENH! Doesnt make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Clark| Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, youve got your freedom now.
Andy| Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
Clark| There you go, good for you.
Andy| No.
Clark| You just let it all hang out, thats what...
Andy| May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. 
Clark| Ill give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Dwight| Aunt Shirley, Hello! Its me Dwight.
Shirley| Oh, lookie here. Its big city Dwight. Careful you dont get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
Angela| Hello Aunt Shirley.
Shirley| Whos this little kitchen witch? Shes so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
Dwight| This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Shirley| New clothes? What for? 
Dwight| OK
Angela| Oh, God.
Dwight| You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angelas gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Angela| Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Shirley| How would you like a mean cold slap? 
Angela| Ow!
Dwight| Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
Shirley| I could do that.
Dwight| Ok.
Angela| No. No.
Dwight| Yeah, trust me.
Angela| No.
Dwight| It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Shirley| Step on it!
Andy| Why doesnt Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasnt she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Phyllis| Andy, dont. No good can come from snooping.
Andy| Im not snooping, theres just some crud on her screen.
Oscar| Youre clearly snooping.
Creed| Thats kinda uncool, man.
Meredith| Ah, come on.
Phyllis| Andy!
Oscar| Thats her private property.
Meredith| Tell us!
Andy| Uh, hello! Whos snooping on who now?
Phyllis| What does that even mean?
Meredith| Whats it say?
Phyllis| Put it down.
Andy| Everyone please, just-
Creed| Its not cool.
Phyllis| Put it down
Oscar| Andy. That is her private property.
Meredith| Boo.
Andy| Oh my god.
Stanley| Uh huh.
Phyllis| See?
Stanley| Thats where noseyll get you.
Phyllis| Told you so.
Andy| Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think Im psycho again. Uh, couldnt shake this feeling that Erins dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Darryl| Man, you cant do that stuff. Youll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Andy| Too late. I found out shes been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
Kevin| Pete...
Clark| Hmm.
Kevin| Pete what?
Pete| It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Pam|  hello!
Jim| Hey! There she is.  How you doin?
Pam| Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
Jim| You look great.
Pam| Ok
Jim| Yeah.
Pam|  Whats that? Is that a-
Jim| Ok, I know where youre going with this, and this is who I am now. Im a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. 
Isaac| Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.
Pam| How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Isaac| Its a phone?
Pam| Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Isaac| Of course, anything for Team Halpert. Youre gonna crush it, Pam.
Pam| Thanks.
Jim| You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Pam| Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
Jim|  Call you right back. What were you saying?
Pam| Ha ha.
Athlead Coworker| Hey, Jim! Weve got Trent Edwards on the line.
Jim| Ive gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? Youre gonna crush it, youre gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
Pam| Bye.
Angela| Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Dwight| In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Shirley| 
Dwight| Now all it takes is half a liter. Shes dreaming. Alright, lets get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Angela| Spray her down?
Dwight| No, its a lot better than it sounds. Theres a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Pete| Hey.
Andy| Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, Im just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted  shlmydia...from Erin. And its incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Pete| Yeah.  You were gone.
Andy| I knew it!
Pete| For a long time, Andy.
Andy| You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
Pete| Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
Andy| No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? Youre fired!
Pete| What?
Andy| Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day-
Pete| Andy?
Andy| ..The camera dont lie!
Pete| Andy.
Andy| Youre being an idiot get..
Pete| Im trying..
Andy| Out of my office, turns out youre fired...
Pete| Andy.
Andy| Because you suck.
Pete| You cant fire-
Andy| And youre fired...
Pete| If you want to talk to me
Andy| So you had a bad day...
Pete| Ill be in the annex.
Andy| Rut ti doh doh...
Pete| Alright? Ill be in the annex.
Andy| Rut tit doh doh...
Pete| Toby!
Andy| Rut ti doh doo doh
Pete| Toby?
Toby| You cant fire Pete. You understand why, right?
Andy| No.
Toby| Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You cant just get rid of people over grudges.
Andy| Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Toby| Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Andy| They already have a contract?  â€œMutually agree to-â€ Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
Toby| Its just boiler plating, you dont have to read it.
Andy| Well, Im not signing away my rights.
Toby| I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Andy| Ok, well well see about that. 
Toby| Andy, its not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy.  Its the original.
Mark| ... talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.
Pam| Hello.
Mark| Hi, Im Mark.
Pam| Hi, Pam, hello.
Mark| Im the horrible boss around here, but please dont hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. DJango! I dont agree with the use of the â€œNâ€ word in that movie. Its, its too soon.
Pam| Im Pam Halpert.
Mark| Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Lets go, Gangnam style.  Hes heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? Thats cause hes American. This is Carl. Uh, hes from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isnt it?
Pam| Oh my god. Hes Michael Scott.
Shirley| Time to get clean!
Dwight| Its hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. Youre gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Angela| You have to use chains?
Dwight| Youll see. Here we go.
Shirley| Lets get this show on the road.
Dwight| Lets do it! Ready? Heres a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Angela| Dwight!
Dwight| Lets get to it.
Angela| No! No!
Dwight| Give it a whirl.
Angela| Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
Shirley| Stop your belly-aching and hose me.
Dwight| I need you to hose my aunt.
Angela| No Dwight!
Dwight| OK you are useless.
Angela| No, Dwight!
Dwight| Give me the hose!
Angela| No Dwight, I wont- 
Dwight| Ahh! OK!
Angela|  Im gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Dwight| Yes maam.
Angela| Good.
Mark| This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, Id toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That aint gonna happen. Hes a temp, dont worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?
Toby| Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. Its the shortest month but it sure doesnt feel that way. We should catch up.
Nellie| Um.
Toby| Yknow Ive been going over my notes from the trial...
Nellie| Oh no.
Toby| ...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Nellie| No no no no.
Toby| ...minor points.
Nellie| No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Toby| Ive been drafting a letter.
Nellie| For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I dont want to hear it!
Mark| My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so theres no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you Im probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say â€œChillaxâ€ people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me.
Roger| No. I heard you.
Mark| Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition!  Kids in the Hall. Just, its not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
Pam|  Oh my god.
Andy| Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
Meredith| Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Andy| Ugh.
Meredith| Kid doesnt have a romantic bone in his body.
Phyllis| Come on Andy, theyre a good match.
Andy| That doesnt matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I dont care if theyre Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliets boss also had feelings.
Darryl| Hey, Andy.
Andy| What?!
Darryl| Youve got a booger bubble going on there.
Andy|  Sorry.
Darryl| Its ok.
Andy| My whole life is a booger bubble!
Mark| This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom.  From The Smurfs movie.
Pam| Yeah, Ive seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but Ive actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Mark| What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.
Pam| Oh, cause it was upside down. 
Mark| Youre a good audience. 
Pam| So um-
Mark| Unlike some of these people around here.
Pam| Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
Mark| Yeah, we dont have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and heres why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You dont jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam?
Pam| Yes.
Mark|  What if Bob Dylan was your boss? Im gonna do Dylan!  Pam Halpert is my name, and Ive been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children?
Pam| Two children, yes.
Mark| You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but thats just being Pam. Well Im kinda cute and Im- but Im married so...leave that be.
Pete| Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Andy| Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation penis. Translation? My manhood.
Pete| Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But youve gotta move on.
Andy| Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Erin| Listen to him, Andy. Hes trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Andy| Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Pete| Well, Ive been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. Id run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. Were even Facebook friends now.
Erin| See? We can all be friends!
Pete| Yeah.
Erin| Just, get over it. It doesnt have to be awkward.
Pete| I do think we can have a fair....
Andy| Yeah, so life gives you lemons and youve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you dont want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So thats fun.
Mark| Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I dont- not allowed to ask. So...
Pam| I am not pr-
Mark| Youre not.
Pam| Pregnant, no.
Mark| I didnt ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
Pam| Wow.
Mark| Dont be afraid, its a different chair. I dont want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
Pam| Im sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Mark| It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
Pam| So, kinda like a receptionist.
Mark| Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, its less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?
Pam| Yes.
Mark| Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.
Pam| I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I cant.
Shirley| Ow! The braid is too tight.
Angela| Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Shirley| Yes maam.
Angela| I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
Shirley| Ok.
Angela| There.
Shirley| Thank you Angela.
Toby| Im going to the prison. This afternoon. Im gonna talk to the strangler.
Nellie| Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Darryl| Dont use his real name. George Howard Scubb. Its a devil name.
Toby| Well I just wanted to say Im doing it. 
Nellie| Hes doing it.
Pam|  hey!
Jim| Hey, howd the interview go?
Pam| Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
Jim| I cant wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, dont eat because Im ordering in.
Pam| Eight? Really?
Jim| Ill make it worth your while, I promise.
Pam| Sure. I mean, its Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. Ill see you at eight.
Jim| Alright, love you.
Pam| Love you.
Alice| Hi.
Erin| Hi.
Alice| Im here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
Erin| Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Alice| Ok, great. Thanks.
Meredith| Fresh meat! Fresh meat! 
Erin| Just keep walking, dont give her anything. Shell take it and run. Im Erin by the way.
Alice| Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.
Erin| Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. Im bad at small talk.
Kevin| Im Kevin.
Alice| Pete?
Pete| Alice. Oh man.
Alice| Its uh, been a while, huh?
Erin| What, do you two know each other?
Pete| Yeah. We uh, have a history.
Erin| Oh.
Alice| History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
Erin| Thats so random.
Pete| Well. Is it?
Erin| Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. 
Creed| Hey Erin, look whos back. The bird man.
Gabe| Hello beautiful.
Kevin| Didnt you two used to do it?
Gabe| We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Creed| Shes looking good.
Toby| Hi, Im uh, Toby Flenderson. Im here to see George Howard Scubb.
Toby| This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it?  I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Clark| So Pete was a librarian?
Alice| He worked as a librarian freshman year.
Clark| Was he like the sexy librarian?
Pete| Ok.
Alice| Is there like somebody whos in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
Andy| Hi.
Alice| Hi.
Andy| Hi, hows it going?
Alice| Hi.  Good. Id love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
Andy| Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
Pete| Andy, that is really inappropriate.
Andy| Awkward.
Pete| It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that youve contrived.
Andy|  Really uncomfortable situation.
Pete| Yeah.
Andy| Its alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta â€œmove onâ€. Aint that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. Hows that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. 
Alice| So theres no marketing department.
Clark| No.
Pete| No.
Gabe| You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, Ive lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, its crazy. Touch it. Its like a warm pumpkin.
Erin| So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Gabe| Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Erin| Yeah.
Gabe| You must be pretty horny. 
Nellie| well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal?  One week?  Ok, two weeks?  Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isnt that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Shirley| I feel like a show pony.
Dwight| And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Angela| Youre welcome. Would you like some stew?
Dwight| By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Angela| Mmhm.
Dwight| Would you like the stink sack?
Angela| Is it any good?
Dwight| No, you dont eat it. Its a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Angela| Thank you. 
Shirley| So, whens the wedding?
Angela| Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Shirley| Thats what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
Pam| Hello?
Jim| Hey! Back here.
Pam| Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Jim| Si, senor.
Pam| Oh, Jim I should have told you I didnt get the job.
Jim| Oh man. Im so sorry. Are you alright?
Pam| Oh, yeah. Im more than alright. Theres just nothing to celebrate.
Jim| Are you kidding? Were in Philly. Were having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. Its from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Pam|  Youre very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Jim| Alright. So, tell me all about it.
Dwight| Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Angela| It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight.
Dwight| Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Angela| No, Dwight. The Senator.
Dwight| Leave him. He probably wont even notice that youre gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Angela| I cant be your monkey, Dwight.
Dwight| Im not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Angela| I made a vow. I gave my word.
Dwight| Stand by your man. Its what I would want if you were mine.
Angela| Good night, D.
Erin| How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Pete| It is so unpleasant. You?
Andy| Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
Andy| Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyones day?
Gabe| Honestly, it was a little weird.
Andy| Really? Hmm. Thats interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldnt be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
Gabe| I still wear Erins button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like were still in a relationship-
Erin| Gabe!
Gabe| ...a lot of the time.
Andy| And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Pete| Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Alice| Ok, while were rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
Pete| It was college. That is what you do.
Alice| Yeah youre also supposed to go to classes, so theres that.
Erin| Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Andy| Well get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
Gabe|  Oh no no no no no no. She wouldnt even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Erin| Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Gabe| I got a tattoo for you.
Erin| I didnt ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Gabe| Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Alice| So youre dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.
Pete| Shes nice to me.
Alice| Hows that P.E. degree coming? Thats what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
Erin| Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, lets-
Gabe| I technically cannot. I dont have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
Pete| Oh my god.
Gabe| What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Pete| Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
Gabe| Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
Pete| No!
Gabe| Erin, are you even hearing this?
Erin| He didnt even say that.
Alice| He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he cant even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?
Gabe| Erin, Ive been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Erin| Gabe, I dont-
Gabe| Give me one night with you...
Erin| What is that supposed to mean?
Gabe| I have shaved everything...
Erin| I dont want you to shave everything.
Alice| I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!
Pete| I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. 
Gabe| I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Pete| Why dont you say in the beginning â€œThis isnt really going that wellâ€
Gabe| Shove his sashimi!
Erin| What do you-!
Alice| Because I had to wait- 
Andy| Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Pam| So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.

Jim| Im sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Pam| I dont know, but its interesting right?
Jim| Its fascinating.
Pam| He said he cant help but tear up when he looks at it. Its like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Jim| Thats amazing. Well, listen. You cant win em all, right?
Pam| Mmhm.
Jim| So, next interview has to be better.
Pam| I dont know.
Jim| What do you mean? Of course it will. Youre amazing.
Pam| I know. Its just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I dont know, I dont know if I want, um, I dont know if I want this.
Jim|  Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Pam| Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Jim| And I have started a business in Philadelphia. 
Oscars Computer| My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment.
Oscar| You could all be doing this, just saying.
Oscar| I watch way too many ads online and I dont do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
