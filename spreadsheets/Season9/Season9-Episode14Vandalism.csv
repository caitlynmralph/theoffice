Nellie| Have you seen Darryl?
Erin| Hes around here somewhere.
Nellie| Mmm. 
Erin| Yeah, Darryls here. So is Santa Claus. Its just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, its Friday. Welcome to me and Darryls world of lies.
Erin| Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And Im his helper. Its so fun.
Erin|  Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
Darryl| How much did you pay for that?
Erin| Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Darryl| Everybody knows I go to Philly. Ive just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
Erin|  Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guys hilarious. Hes here today. 
Pam| Ive really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because hes in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. Im usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I dont know, this time I feel like its, um, its really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? Youve gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way!
Angela| Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? Its Phillips first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house. 
Erin| Aw, cute! So therell be a bunch of kids.
Angela| No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Kevin| Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping...  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation... 
Angela| No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
Oscar|  Angela. Youre going to find out, so I thought Id let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
Angela| What?
Oscar| He said he wanted me there for support.
Angela| Im his! His... wife. 
Oscar| Angelas husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today.  Me.
Angela|  We agreed that you wouldnt be seen with him in public. Its humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
Jim|  Hey.
Darryl| Hey.
Jim| We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Darryl| Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Jim| And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, its, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Darryl| Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Jim| Im couching it!
Darryl| Which usually means theres clothes all over the living room.
Jim| And this dude labels his food. Hes the clean one. And, Im the messy one. How much fun is this?
Darryl| I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. Its just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesnt wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job.
Pam|  Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I dont know everybodys name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. Its my choice.
Pam| I dont demand justice often. Im not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Vals no help. Andys gone. Jims out. I just feel like Im on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
Jim| Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Darryl| Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Jim|  Who is this guy? We are killing it.      
Darryl| Yes sir. 
Jim| Yeah!
Pam|  Conference room. Everybody. Now!
Dwight| You dont have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Pam| Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... Thats gonna be revealed once were in the conference room for the meeting.
Dwight| Youre telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Pam| Yeah.
Dwight| Lets go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
Pam|  I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it. 
Erin| I thought thats what you were doing.
Pam| Yeah, but this is different.
Erin| Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Pam| I dont think so, but they put paint where I didnt want paint. So... 
Erin| I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Pam| Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
Meredith| Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the mens room wall. Which is so messed up. Its 6782 not 83.
Creed| Uh, 6783s also a good time. Less mileage.
Oscar| Pam, what can be done?
Pam| Yes. Thank you. Lets answer that question.
Oscar| I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Pam| What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Phyllis| David Wallace called this meeting?
Pam| Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
Pam|  No, no. Come on, guys. Dont go.
Dwight| Pam, Ill help you. 
Pam| You will?
Dwight| If theres anything I hate worse than art, its crime.
Pam| Thank you.
Nellie| I am in too, Pam.
Pam| Yeah?
Nellie| Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
Pam| Great.
Pam| I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, Im pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
Dwight|  You need my pitchfork? 
Angela|  Hey!
Dwight| What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Angela| Exciting news. Theres room for one more at my sons birthday event. And, I want you.
Dwight| Ah, Im not interested.
Angela| What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
Dwight| If I get the deicing gig, its not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. 
Kevin| Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight cant come to your sons birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Angela| No. 
Kevin| OK. I understand. Ill just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
Angela| Aw, crap.
Dwight|  I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no ones business but my own.
Frank| Youre gonna to compare um to the butts up there. 
Dwight| Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
Glenn| Im not drawing a butt.
Nellie| All right then, theyre bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws. 
Dwight| Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Val| OK, OK. I think its time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Lets go.
Dwight| Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts... 
Nellie| Well, this is getting us nowhere. 
Pam| We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him. 
Dwight| We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying. 
Pam| See, I feel bad about that.
Dwight| Its all right. Its all right.   
Nate| So, shes gonna pull through again?  Thats great. Can I talk to her?
Dwight| No. She needs her rest again. 
Nellie| Now listen. Now that we have got you here, lets talk about this mural business.
Dwight| You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but weve got chewing gum.
Nate| Gums gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of its just too minty. Its like theyre literally trying to hurt... 
Pam|  Tell us who defaced the mural!
Nate|  He did it. 
Pam| All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Dwight| Theres no gum. There never was any gum.
Nate|  Thats really rude.
Kevin|  Opening with pub pastries? Thats a bold play. Theyre saying, its only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
Oscar|  That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Party Announcer| Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton. 
Senator| Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular.
Angela|  Oh, Robert, youre horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here?
Athlead Employee|  This is the team.
Jim| Nice job, man.
Darryl| You too... Darryl.
Jim|  What?  Oh, man! Im sorry about that.
Darryl| Its cool. Readings tricky sometimes.
Jim| Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Darryl| Thats my go-to thermos. Thats all.
Jim| Oh. Its your go-to therm. Oh, man. Thats a bummer. Im sorry about that.
Darryl| No big deal. No big deal. 
Jim| No, no. If its a big deal, its a big deal.
Darryl| Nah, nah... 
Jim| No big deal.
Darryl|  Nah, nah, nah. You dont have to do that.
Jim| Honestly, I dont mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Darryl| I dont know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Jim|  OK. Here ya go. 
Darryl| Thank you.
Nellie| So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Pam|  Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if Ive done anything to offend you. Im sure it isnt easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
Toby|  You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank? 
Frank| Im sorry I didnt like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.  
Pam| Well, I didnt think that butt was funny.
Frank| Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.
Pam| What was that?
Frank| You know what? You people cant fire me. So, screw you. 
Pam| Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Toby| Uh... it... compliment... 
Nellie| The first sorry sounded sincere.
Toby| There were two or three sorrys in there. 
Pam| That sucked. He didnt apologize. Theres no talking to that guy.
Dwight| Oh, your little feelings party didnt work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Pam| We should just take him down. 
Dwight| Wait. Are you saying... 
Pam| Im saying we should go scorched earth on that guys face.
Dwight| Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And Im like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Dwight| He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something thats important to him.
Pam| Yes!
Dwight| A little eye for an eye action.
Pam| Yes!
Dwight| Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
Pam| We need an infiltrator.
Dwight| I know just the man for the job. 
Pam| Clark?
Dwight| He even looks like a mole.
Oscar| One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Party Guest| You two seem very close.
Senator| Yes. Were good friends. Good friends.
Oscar| Yeah.
Senator| You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned its back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am.  I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, its time we bid bigotry hasta luego.  Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I dont know. And I dont care. What I care about is Oscar.  My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar. 
Oscar| Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he couldve invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelios Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
Darryl| Oh, hey.
Jim| Hey.
Darryl| I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. Its cool?
Jim| Yeah. Totally.
Darryl| All right.
Jim|  Its mine. Dont worry. 
Darryl| I didnt say anything.
Jim| I dont think you had to.
Darryl| Excuse me?
Jim| I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldnt use that?
Darryl| What you need flour for, Jim?
Jim| Thats not the point.
Darryl| What? You making bread?
Jim| No, Im not making bread.
Darryl| What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Jim| Darryl, it doesnt matter. I think you know the point Im trying to make.
Darryl| All right, Im being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. Thats all.
Jim| Its all good. Are we all good? 
Darryl| We good.
Jim| Whats that cooler?
Darryl| Nothing.  Its mine.   What happened to my Tavis Smileys? 
Jim| Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Dwight|  I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me? 
Clark| Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
Dwight| Silence. Youll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
Clark| OK, boss.  Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like youre smarter than this. 
Pam| Shh, shh.
Clark| This is never gonna work.
Pam| Shh. Remember your lines.
Clark| What lines?
Dwight| Go move some paper!
Pam|  Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
Darryl| Hes not my hire, but I know who he is.
Pam| OK. What does he like? Whats important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or... 
Darryl| What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Pam| Yeah, something like that.
Darryl| I know he loves his pick up truck.
Pam| Oh, great!  His truck! 
Dwight| Great. Get the plate number.
Pam| OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
Dwight| So we know which truck to van... 
Darryl| Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husbands like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Pam| Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on. 
Party Photographer| Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Lets get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? Im gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there. 
Angela| Hes blocking me.
Senator| Its only a photo, honey.
Party Photographer|  Excuse me, uh, whats your name?
Party Waiter| Sean.
Party Photographer| LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way.  Not you. No.
Oscar| He put me here.
Angela| He put you right in front of me?
Party Photographer| Lets just wheel Margaret right in front... 
Oscar| Ow! Robert?!
Senator| Angela.
Party Photographer| Smile. 
Pam| Im done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Dwight| Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, Im drawing your mural on Franks trucks butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Pam| Aw, Dwight. Thats really sweet.
Dwight| Lets see yours. 
Pam| Oh, no. Um, I, Im embarrassed. Its stupid.
Dwight| This is amazing! Frank! And hes leaving a trail of poops?
Pam| Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
Dwight| I saw that. Thats great!
Pam| Yeah. I feel better. 
Dwight| Good. Im glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch. 
Pam| I know. You miss Angela, dont you?
Dwight| Ugh! Dont sympathize. Youre ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Pam| I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. Its gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
Frank|  Lady! My truck? You had no right!
Pam|No, you had no right! 
Frank| Its a $40,000 truck! 
Pam| So? You started it!
Frank| So? So someone need to shut you up! 
Brian| Hey, hey, hey!  
Pam| Whoa.
Brian|  Easy! 
Frank| You son of a bitch!
Brian| Youre gonna hit a woman?
Senator| Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much.  Well. Have we all calmed down yet? 
Oscar| Yes. Sorry about that.
Angela| It was all my fault. 
Senator| Lets all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you.
Kevin| Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
Senator| I beg your pardon.
Kevin| You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and youre just using them. Again, the food was very good. 
Pam| Well, Im gonna say something to the producers.
Brian| No. No, its... 
Pam| You shouldnt be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
Brian| Its all good. I knew what I was doing. Its... Im sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
Pam| Forget about my mural. Its stupid.
Brian| No. You, you worked hard on that. That guys an animal. Im glad theyre firing him too.
Pam| Its crazy. Brian, Im so sorry. 
Brian| Look. I dont, I dont wanna put myself where I dont belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And Ill be there for you. 
Pam| Thanks, Brian.
Brian| Seeya.
Jim| Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, thats just Roommates 101. 
Darryl|  Oh. Come on!
Jim| Oh. Oh!
Darryl| Damn!
Jim|  You win.  How good did that feel?
Darryl| That felt really good, actually.
