 Stone & Son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it! â€“David Wallace|Dwight
 Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. Theyre a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. Wed go in pretending to be family â€“ brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.|Dwight
  I hope youve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because its time for another episode of â€œHandsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hireâ€.|Jim
 Sorry, Stinky, cant do it. Too busy.|Dwight
 Oh, god, this again? Youre Stinky.|Jim
 Okay. Theres no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.|Dwight
 Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.|Phyllis
 I have ears, Dwight.|Dwight
 Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim?|Jim
 Hey, Im in Philadelphia right now.|Dwight
 How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.|Jim
 Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?|Dwight
 Mmm. Thats a good question. 300 times  180 Um that comes to 25 minutes.  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.|Nellie
 Darryl, looking good!|Darryl
 Heading to Philly. Interview with Jims company.|Pam
 Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?|Darryl
 Why dont you come along and tell him yourself?|Pam
 Ha ha. Thatd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get What do you get? Oh my god! Why didnt I think of this? Andys not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, Im expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?|Erin
 Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.|Pam
 A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everythings in order.|Erin
 What? Everything? What, how do I make sure its in order? I  havent been trained for this.|Pam
  Okay, see you later.|Clark
 Hey guys.|Phyllis
 Clark!|Meredith
 Hey!|Oscar
 Hey, look whos back, Dwight Junior.|Kevin
 Hey, so how was it? I mean the sex with Jan.|Clark
 A gentleman doesnt discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.|Clark
 Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.|Meredith
 Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, â€œTalk classy, act nastyâ€.|Clark
 Whats with the wig Meredith?|Meredith
 What, is it on backwards? |Clark
 Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. Its an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so bon appetite.|Phyllis
 Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now thats Italian.|Oscar
 My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.|Meredith
 Always with the friends Oscar. Cant we just enjoy the new espresso machine?|Oscar
 Actually, its pronounced â€œespressoâ€ Wait. Thats what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So|Dwight
 There he is!  We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but|Clark
 If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.|Dwight
 Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?|Clark
  I loved it.|Dwight
 How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?|Clark
 If itll lead to me being a salesman, Ill pretend to be your friend.|Dwight
 Then looks like we have a deal Son |Erin
 Hi guys!|Pete
 Hey, look who it is!|Erin
 Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.|Oscar
 Try this one. |Erin
 Thank you! |Erin
 I dont really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyones trust. About the pens.|Pam
 You ready for your interview?|Darryl
 I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andys job in the bag until my interview.|Pam
 Well, you shouldnt be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.|Darryl
 Yeah, I guess|Pam
 Really, you cant be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but hes basically Gumby with hair. |Suit Store Father
  Its kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.|Dwight
 You know, youre right! We hadnt even thought of that, had we boy? |Clark
 No, we sure hadnt Pop. |Dwight
  Oh! Youre a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? |Clark
 He calls me Clarky â€˜cause hes my Dad.|Dwight
 Guilty!|Suit Store Father
 You dont meet many hunters these days.|Clark
 My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, hes like a serial killer of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! |Dwight
 It was his birthday, just turned three. So|Suit Store Father
 Ahh|Oscar
 You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?|Nellie
 No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?|Kevin
 Taste test? Im in!|Oscar
 YOLO! |Phyllis
 What? |Oscar
 Its a thing. It means â€œyou only live onceâ€.|Kevin
 Yeah, were aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.|Oscar
 Well|Kevin
 Alright everybody, whos in?  Angela?  Dont make us come over there.|Angela
 No, I dont no.|Kevin
 Alright, lets go. |Angela
 Cant I just agree without putting my hand in?|Nellie
 Absolutely not!|Kevin
 No way.|Angela
 Oh, fine. |Kevin
 Ok guys, â€œwe all drink them allâ€.|Everyone
  We all drink them all!|Kevin
 Yes!|Oscar
 Yes!|Nellie
 Whoo!|Phyllis
 Hey, wheres my ring?|Creed
 Im sure itll turn up.|Athlead Employee
  Yes maam, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. Youll see us on the right side, you cant miss us.|Dennis
 And I want to reach every demographic possible.|Jim
 No, I hear what youre saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?|Dennis
 Were talking weeks here, not months, right?|Jim
 Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.|Dennis
 Alright. Good.|Jim
 Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?|Pam
 Good!|Jim
 What are you doing here?|Pam
 I just wanted to see you!|Jim
 Thats so great!|Darryl
 Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!|Jim
 Its pretty great, right? I mean, were coming along  Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Denniss timeline|Wade
 Okay|Jim
  Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.|Dwight
 But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clarks getting out of my car. Hes a good boy, does whatever I say.|Suit Store Father
  I cant relate to that, my son hates my guts.|Dwight
 Oh really.|Suit Store Father
 Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?|Dwight
  Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that theyre not even good. Really, theyre bad. Like you and your son.|Clark
  Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but God I missed you!|Dwight
 What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?|Clark
  I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.|Dwight
 Youre being disrespectful!|Clark
 And I love you, for saying that.|Dwight
  We dont get along.|Clark
  Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is our relationship is terr-|Dwight
 Terrible!|Clark
 Terrible.|Dwight
 Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!|Pam
 Wow, this place is so great. I had no idea â€“ on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.|Jim
 Well, I mean, I dont even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so These things go down all the time.|Darryl
 If this companys going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.|Jim
  Are you cool to just hang out?|Pam
 Sure, no problem.|Jim
 Yeah?  You ready?|Darryl
 Yeah.|Jim
 Lets do it!|Erin
 The pen delivery went amazing, and now Ive got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and Im not one of those people whos just like, â€œUh, sure. Ill accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your backs turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand they are just sitting here. Pam didnt tell me not to unpack them. Dont want to be a busybody, but I dont want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, its insane! Im sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. Ive never had an espresso before. Theyre good though.|Nellie
 A-bam!  My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor Ive tried so far is Alpine Select!|Kevin
 Yes! |Angela
 Ugh!|Kevin
 One! |Angela
 Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!|Kevin
 Two |Angela
 Stop it!|Kevin
 Three|Oscar
 Thats enough Kevin.|Angela
 Stop it Kevin!|Kevin
 Four!|Oscar
 Thats enough!|Angela

 So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.|Suit Store Father
 I heard that before|Clark
 Well, I understand, but â€“|Dwight
 I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.|Clark
 Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.|Suit Store Father
 Listen to him. He created you.|Dwight
 Maybe if you listened a little bit, youd improve. No wonder women despise you.|Clark
 Women dont despise me|Dwight
 His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adams apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldnt see it, or didnt wanna see it.|Clark
 Alright, thats enough, â€˜cause I can say some things about him too.|Dwight
 Yeah? Like what?|Clark
 Like the time that you got drunk and, and then Killed those kids on their way to prom!|Dwight
 That never happened. Hes always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught â€œsaving treatsâ€ from the kitty litter box.|Suit Store Father
 Really shameful|Clark
 So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-|Dwight
 Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.|Clark
 Theres obviously a volume discount uh, if you-|Dwight
 Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going â€œplease kitty, may I have some more?â€ You cant make this stuff up!|Clark
 No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.|Suit Store Son
 Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting.|Suit Store Father
 Here he is, my son.|Dwight
  Got cat turd collector written all over him.|Suit Store Son
 Did you say cat turd collector?|Athlead Employee
