Andy|  Ah, what else? Ive seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
Everyone| Whoa!
Pam| Andy.
Andy| That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Phyllis| Dont you have any sunblock?
Andy| No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  Theyre like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
Erin| Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his familys boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Andy|  Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. Thats what I call the sun now.
Darryl| Andy, its Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Andy| What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Erin| Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Andy| Yeah, it was. Thats okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Everyone| Oh!
Andy| Ah! Thats not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? 
Darryl| Hes been sailing for two days.
Andy|  I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
Erin|  Yeah.
Andy| No. No! Nooo! 
Erin| Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
Dwight|  Dwight Schrute.  Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
David|  Well, I have some very exciting news.
Dwight| And you didnt call Jim - that seems significant.
Jim| Hi, David.
David| Jim, good! You should hear this too.
Dwight| No, he shouldnt.
Jim|  Go ahead David, Im listening.
Dwight| Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I dont know where Id put you.
David| Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. Theyve apparently just dropped the supplier theyve been with for the last ten years. .
Dwight| The White Pages.
Dwight| The White Pages Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. Theres a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing â€œthe White Whaleâ€. Look at all that sweet blubber.
David| Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
Dwight| Im gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... wheres Stanley?
Erin| Hes in the bathroom.
Dwight| Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Erin| Of course.
Dwight| Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, Im back.
Erin|  Eat it Stanley!
Dwight| So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
David| No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. Its someone new but she didnt catch her name.
Dwight| Her name?
Phyllis| No, hey, Dwight shouldnt...
Dwight| Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
David| Good luck!
Dwight| Good luck to you. 
Phyllis| Dwight, you cant go. You have a problem with women. You cant sell to them.
Dwight| That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Phyllis| Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her â€˜gy-na for your entire meeting.
Nellie| Ew. Thats not good.
Phyllis| Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
Dwight| â€˜Gy-na said that?
Phyllis| Guys, we cant let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Meredith| Hey remember that week in the 90s when we got bagels?
Creed| I miss Clinton.
Pam| Can you go instead?
Jim| I cant. I have the thing.
Jim| I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that Im helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time Ive ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Pete| Okay, call down. Its just me, not Tom Selleck.
Guys in breakroom| 
Kevin| Nice!
Pete| Toby got us all to participate in Movember. Its a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
Clark| So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Darryl| Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
Toby| I have very fertile hair glands.
Toby| I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Clark| God!
Toby| We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
Toby|  Smile if you love mens prostates.
Angela| Hi.
Oscar| Hi.
Angela| Spring cleaning?
Oscar| More like fall cleaning. 
Angela|  I think the senator is having an affair.
Oscar|  This doesnt... Im sorry. Wha... what?
Angela| I think the senator is having an affair.
Oscar| I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angelas husband spoon me back to bed.
Angela| When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
Oscar| Oh, Im sure ...thats nothing.
Angela| And hes always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - its Hot Yoga with Blake.
Oscar| Angela, Blakes also a guys name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Angela| I dont know.
Oscar| I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Angela| Right.
Oscar| From you. Im sure its probably nothing. But whats with the yoga already?
Angela| Right?
Oscar| And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Angela| What?
Oscar| Angela, Ill go with you.
Phyllis| So, uh, show us how youd normally sell to a female client.
Dwight| Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Pam| Youve got this Schrute.
Phyllis| Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
Dwight| Hello.
Erin| Hello.
Dwight| May I please speak to your boss?
Phyllis| No, she is the boss.
Erin| I am? Hmm..   Hi, Im Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Dwight| Okay, this isnt working for me, â€˜cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Erin| Hes absolutely right. Im really struggling.
Pam| Oh, Ill be the buyer.
Dwight| 
Pam| Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
Dwight| I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Phyllis| No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Dwight| I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once Im finished, its over.
Pam| Okay, lets stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
Dwight| I thought it went great.
Nellie| I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Business partner|  Okay lets get started.
Jim| Yeah, Im here. Are we all on?
Business partner| Uh,, well youre the only one â€˜on - were all here.
Jim|  Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Kevin| Thats the winter season., three months.
Jim| I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
Business partner| Are you at your office right now?
Jim|  Uh yeah. Trust me, Id rather be with you guys.
Business partner|  Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.
Jim| Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Business partner| Whoa.  I think theres been a bit of a mistake. Were trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman.
Jim|   Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Business partner| Uh, yeah...
Jim| Im gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Business partner| Okay, yeah.
Jim| Okay, Ill call you right back.
Kevin| Whats happening in three months?
Pam| Okay, when youre selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Dwight| Yes.
Pam| Okay, well you have to show us.
Dwight| Thats impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs dont vibrate at all.
Pam| Huh.  Uh huh.
Dwight| What are you doing?
Pam| A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Dwight| Kind of.
Pam| Nellie, why dont you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that youre listening.
Nellie|  Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that Ive commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
Erin| Its just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
Dwight| I am a person.
Erin| Yes.
Nellie| And then we thought wed  I cant. I just cant  carry on with that face. Look at it. Im gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like hes laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
Dwight| Thats a bit extreme.
Nellie| No, Im sorry but that is true.
Meredith| Hes screwed. Theyre meeting in less than an hour.
Phyllis| Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. Its all garbage okay? Youre the woman, Im the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Dwight| Okay, Im a woman.  Im a woman. Good?
Phyllis| Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
Dwight| Hello.
Phyllis| Oh, are those your kids? Theyre so cute! They could be models.
Dwight| Thank you. Im so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Meredith| Booo! Weird.
Nellie| No.
Phyllis| Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. Its hopeless.
Pam| Ten years ago, I didnt care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now Im like, that poor gimp is somebodys child.
Pam| You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Dwight| Look, I have no problem with women. Its businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Dont lie about your shoulders!
Pam| Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
Dwight| I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Pam| Okay, so, when youre selling to this woman, just imagine that shes that nice, reasonable barber.
Dwight| Okay, I can do that.
Pam| Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
Dwight| He used to fight dogs.
Pam| Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Dwight| Little of this, little of that.
Angela| Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Oscar| Angela!  Angela. There.
Angela| Where?
Oscar|  On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Angela| Oh my God! Shes so stunningly tiny!  Shes like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what theyre doing.
Oscar| Shes repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Angela|  Ive heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. Id like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Lets go.
Oscar| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Angela| Ow.
Oscar| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
Pete| 
Toby| This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
Jim| What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Business partner|  It was in what? Jim, were having a lot of trouble hearing you.
Jim| The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
Hank| Hey! Are those skateboarders back?
Business partner|  Jim? Jim, are you there?
Hank| Where are they?
Jim| It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Meredith| Who was messing with my van?
Jim| Nobody!
Business partner|   Jordan wore them for nobody? Were not following you, Halpert.
Jim| No, no, no.
Hank| This ends now!
Secretary| Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.
Pam| Oh, great. Oh, Im sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we dont have it.
Secretary| Uh... um shell be right in.
Pam| Okay, great.
Dwight|  Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Pam| Oh my God. Its Jan.
Dwight| Oh, dear God in heaven.
Pam| Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
Pam| Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Pam| Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! Its so great to see you.
Jan| Wheres Wallace?
Pam| What?
Jan| I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Dwight| Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. 
Pam| Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
Jan| Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
Molly| Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant.  And I guess it did get a little confusing  â€˜cause you said not to tell anyone your name.  And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...
Jan| Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Molly| Im so sorry Jan.
Jan| I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
Dwight| Listening.
Jan| Stop.
Dwight| Sorry.
Jan| Stop that.
Dwight| Okay.
Pam| So this was all just a trick. You dont really have any business to give?
Jan| No, I do.
Pam| But not to us.
Jan| Insightful, Pam.
Pam| You did good, Dwight. Its okay. I mean, seriously, Jans not normal. Lets just go. Shes not going to sell to us.
Dwight| Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. Ill be right back.
Pam| What?
Jan| Pam?
Pam| Yeah.
Jan| Im a very busy woman, so...
Pam| Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
Jan| Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Pete| Erin, did this call...
Erin| Uh!
Pete| What?
Erin| Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
Pete| Oh, Im sorry. Its for the thing.
Erin| I know. Thats great. It just - it makes it look like theres an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
Pete| Wow.
Erin| A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isnt bad.
Pete| Uh-huh.
Erin| But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. Its such a great cause.
Pete| Yeah.
Erin| 
Jan|  Mommy, youre a princess. Mommy, youre a superstar. Mommy youre the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Pam| Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
Jan| Aw.
Pam| And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Jan|  Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Pam| Oh, okay. Its just thats how Cece does it with the backwards â€˜Es.
Jan| Cece cant spell her name.
Pam| Oh, actually she can.
Jan| Well, its not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, â€œCeceâ€ is two letters and â€œAstridâ€ is... I mean, theres even some adults who -- who -- who cant spell it.
Pam| Of course.
Jan| Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Pam| Um... â€œAâ€... â€œXâ€? I dont -- you got me.
Jan| Dont patronize me.
Pam|  Im so sorry. I hate this. Youre better.
Angela|  Okay, we should go now. Lets go.
Oscar|  Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. 
Angela| Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Cant get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
Oscar|  Please. Its Robert whos enjoying it.
Angela| What?
Oscar| This could be the affair that youre scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are.  But uh, hes probably not gay. Hes straight. Hes straight, so...
Pam| Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
Jan| No.
Dwight| Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well Ive got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Pam| Oh, my God.
Clark| Wheres the Quiznos?
Dwight| Youre the Quiznos.  Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasnt quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
Jan| I -- I --
Dwight| Hmm?
Jan| I dont recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Pam| Okay, you do not have to do this.
Clark| Do what? Get into sales? Thats what I want.
Dwight| Hes been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
Jan| Will you uh,  you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
Dwight| Very good.
Jan|  Do you have a valid passport?
Jim| Jim Halpert.
Colin|  Hey, its Colin.
Jim| Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
Colin| I know. Dont worry about it.
Jim| 
Colin| Its just... its not totally working.
Jim| Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But dont worry. Ill figure it out.
Colin| Yeah, well, its not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I dont know how were gonna do this.
Jim| Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Angela| Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
Oscar| I dont know, Angela. Im dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Angela| Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Oscar| Hes making a phone call.
Angela|  Oh. Oh.
Oscar| 
Pam| Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
Molly| Thanks. Okay.
Dwight| Oh and uh, Molly... I know it cant be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
Pam| Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
Dwight| Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
Pam| Thats a license number?
Dwight| Thats all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Pam| Oh. Why me?
Dwight| Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. Its like air to you people. Ugh, God.
