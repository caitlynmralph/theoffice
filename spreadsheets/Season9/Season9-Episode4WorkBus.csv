Andy| Alright everybody, great season of softball, Im super proud of you guys and I think youre gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together.
Kevin|Thats me.
Oscar| Is this like a blooper reel?
Andy| A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail!  Whos this guy?
Dwight| Fail!
Jim| I deserved that.
Andy| Do do do do do do do.
Darryl| That was a triple.
Andy| Cant take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
Darryl| My pleasure.
Andy| Hey, Im Pete, puberty is such a drag, man. And Im Clark! I like to eat toilet paper.  We fail!
Andy|Id like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.
Andy|Well, thats all folks. Ski ya later everybody.  Thanks for a great season.
Oscar|What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Andy|Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Jim|Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Andy|Oh that wasnt...that didnt work. That was not the right..
Jim|I think I got it right here.
Andy| That was not a fail.
Group| Fail! Fail! Fail!...
Andy| That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.  Youre all failing right now.  Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!
Dwight|  Oh, god.
Phyllis| Whats going on?
Dwight| Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
Stanley| Whats he measuring?
Dwight| OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Toby| Its an EMF hotspot.
Phyllis|  Oh my god!
Oscar| It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area  Especially if theyre poorly insulated. Dwight.
Andy| Um, OK Im just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
Toby| You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Andy| I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Stanley| Well Im not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Dwight| OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
Dwight|  Oh, the wires need insulation.  Its a wire people. Im not buying it a fur coat.
Pam|  Thank you.
Jim| You got it.
Jim| Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first.
Nellie| Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it wont take a moment. Its extremely important and it really has to happen now.
Andy| Fine. I will give you one minute.
Nellie| Oh, please dont use the hourglass.
Andy| You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of its baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
Nellie| Im trying to adopt a baby.
Andy| A baby what? A human?!
Nellie| And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Andy| Oh.
Nellie| You wouldnt have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Andy| Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I dont think so.
Nellie| Its not..its-
Andy| And I happen to notice youre down to about thirty seconds here.
Nellie| Well then if I could just convince...
Andy| And those sand grains are tumbling..
Nellie| You.
Andy| With fury...
Nellie| Its not..its not
Andy| Down the sides..
Nellie| Entrapment if Im..
Andy| Of the hourglass..
Nellie| ..writing..
Andy| Times up!
Nellie| Fine.
Andy| Sure.  Ill read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. Ill sign that.
Dwight|  â€œStatistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!â€ That means you cant make me do squat.
Meredith| You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I aint losing any more good parts.
Dwight| You people dont realize what youre asking. Id have to rip open the walls.  Wed have to shut this place down for a week.
Pam| Week off. Thatd be great.
Darryl|  Hey, if you dont want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Clark| I dont want to teach you Power Point.
Darryl| Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Clark| Just do the tutorial.
Darryl| Youre the tutorial.
Clark| No, dude, Im not. Im not the tutorial.
Darryl| You could be.
Clark| Mm-mm.
Darryl|  What are you doing?
Jim| Getting my wife a week off from work.
Darryl| You popped one kernel.
Jim| Awesome, right?
Clark| So Creed is that dudes step dad?
Darryl| Correct.
Jim| Well, I dont know about the rest of you but Im just gonna say it. Im nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.
Dwight| What? Come on.
Creed| Im getting older. Im losing my hair...
Meredith| Im not gonna grow a third arm!
Dwight| I know what Jim is trying to do. Hes trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
Jim|  â€œSide effects of EMF include headaches...â€
Dwight| Had em all my life.
Jim|â€..breast pain...â€
Dwight| No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
Jim| Oof. â€œInfertility.â€
Dwight|  Yeah right.
Jim| Ah! Theres my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Dwight| Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the?
Jim| What?
Dwight| Some of these kernels have crowned.
Jim| Thats impossible, cause thats a brand new bag... Oh my god.
Dwight| Andy!
Jim| Im gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Pam| Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
Jim| You mean Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. Well be getting a dozen.
Pam| A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Jim| Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Pam| Yeah, OK then.
Andy| Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
Dwight| So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Meredith| Nice job.
Dwight| In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
Jim| What?
Pam| Whats this?
Andy| Whoa!
Jim| What?
Dwight|  Bring it in!
Dwight| Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isnt just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus.  If youve got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Stanley|  There are a hundred packs..
Oscar|  No six after the eight, no....
Stanley| Shh!
Oscar| Shh!
Stanley| Ninety nine cases..yeah.
Oscar| Six.
Angela| Ooh!
Pete| Oh sorry! Sorry.
Angela| Oh my god!
Erin|  Sorry.
Meredith| Lose weight.
Erin| Im trying. Sorry.
Erin|  Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Nellie| Oh of course, you were adopted.
Erin|  I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I dont know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well.
Nellie| Listen, Im really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Erin| Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Nellie| Oh thank you so much!
Erin|  Just dont tell Andy, because..
Nellie| He hates me and thinks Im a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness.
Clark| Stretch. Alright.
Stanley| How many times do you need to take a stroll?
Clark| I, my legs cramp up! Ok, its a circulation issue.
Stanley| Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
Jim| Alright, alright, gang. Lets just settle down. Youre yelling in her face.
Clark| Its a medical thing.
Jim| Just...you good?
Clark| Im good. I..
Jim|  Im so sorry for all of this.
Pam| Its OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Angela| I, I need to get to the paper please.
Pam| Oh my god! Ah!
Jim| Ill get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Pam| You know what? Its fine, its fine. Let me just...its fine.
Jim| Pam, Im really sorry. I- Im really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking?
Dwight| What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now youre locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Jim| Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Dwight| Its not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Jim| Andy!
Andy| Yo. Dudeces.
Jim| Youre the boss. Dont you think wed all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Phyllis| Oh, I know Id be more productive.
Kevin| As would I.
Stanley| No question.
Dwight| No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Jim| What are you talking about? Youre not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Phyllis, Kevin &amp; Stanley| Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!
Andy| Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
Erin| Yes!
Jim| Next stop Lavernes Pies Tires Fixed Also.
Pam| Oh! Yes!
Jim|  So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Dwight| Get your foot behind the yellow line.
Jim| You got it.
Erin| Yeah Jim!
Darryl|  Stop.
Clark| Come back.
Darryl| Too late.
Clark| Mmm.
Group| Shabooyah, role call. Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call.
Pam| My name is Pam.
Group| Yeah!
Pam| I like to paint.
Group| Yeah!
Pam| You think youre better?
Group| Yeah!
Pam| Oh no you aint!
Group| Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call!
Kevin| My name is Kevin.

Group| Yeah!
Kevin| Cause thats my name.
Group| Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call!
Creed|  Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Andy| Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve!  Ah OK, now a serious one.
Pam| Hey, wheres Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
Jim| If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Pam| No, I mean hes sulking. Thats not like him.
Jim| Hes just mad that were all having fun.
Pam| Then why isnt he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Jim| Hes fine. Hes indestructible.
Erin| Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. Were not hostages.
Nellie|  Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
Erin| Never say that.
Erin| I am so excited thinking about this child youre going to adopt.
Nellie| I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Stanley| Next stop pies!
Group| Next stop pies!
Kevin| Next stop pies!
Jim| Lets go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Kevin| At five? Thats only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Angela| So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Kevin| Wh...
Oscar| Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Kevin| 314 pies.
Oscar| What if it were salads?
Kevin| Well, its the...carry the four...and...it doesnt work.
Dwight| Im sorry to spoil Jims fantastic voyage everyone, but were almost out of gas.
Jim| OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Dwight| That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Jim| Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
Pam| Hey honey, I dont think we should push him.
Jim| Oh no, Im gonna push him. You know why? Because youre getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? Hes trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we wont get there. Is that what we want?!
Group| No!
Dwight| Stop ordering me around, Jim!
Jim| What do we want?!
Group| Pies!
Jim| When do we want it?!
Group| Pies!
Dwight| OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
Jim| Thats impossible.  Dwight!
Meredith| Oh my!
Jim| What are you doing?
Meredith| Dwight, what the hell?
Oscar| Dwight!
Clark| What?
Kevin| Well now I dont even feel like pie. Wait...no its back.
Phyllis|  Just drive away. Just..
Pam| Phyllis! Thats not safe.
Kevin| Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour were just gonna barely make it.
Pam|  Go up and check on him. Hes upset.
Jim| You know hes doing all this on purpose.
Pam| Please? Just make sure hes OK?
Stanley| Hurry it up for gods sake. Theyre gonna be out of banana cream!
Andy| Banana cream is the first to go.  Well be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!
Meredith| What?
Jim| Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Dwight| Im barren, Jim.
Jim| What?
Dwight| My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Jim| Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Dwight| You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Jim| No.
Dwight| Thats genius. Thats the best prank youve ever done.
Jim| Ill take it.
Nellie| Andy?
Andy| Who is it?
Nellie| Um, is this a good time?
Andy| Yeah. Perfect time. Im right in the middle of a rooftop crisis.  Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok,  blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, youve made this very easy for me. Its unsignable.
Nellie| Oh, why, is there something?
Andy| Its inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
Nellie| Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
Andy| Heres the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
Nellie| Alright then.
Jim| Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Dwight| Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Jim| That doesnt matter.
Dwight| What position did you use to conceive?
Jim| Ok...thats not...
Dwight| Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didnt you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Andy|  British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
Pete| I dont think thats Nelly.
Andy| What?
Nellie| Oh, oh no, no. Look, its alright.  It really isnt your fault. No, no. Look, its...you were so kind. And it isnt anything to do with you.
Jim| Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, were all kinda like your children?
Dwight| You know theres a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Jim| Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Dwight| Bildenkinder.
Jim| OK. And theyre all dangerously close to not getting pie. And theres only one guy who can save them. Its not me.
Pam| Oh!  Hey! Howd it go?
Jim| Its pretty good actually.
Pam| Yeah?
Jim| We bonded. We got to-
Oscar| Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!
Dwight| When you dont get out of the way! Out of the way!
Pam| You feel OK now?
Dwight| Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? Im gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Pam| Well, actually, rhubarb is-
Jim| Dont..
Pam| the one pie that I dont.
Jim| Dont..
Dwight| Everybody! Hang on!
Angela| Oh!
Jim|  Pie! Pie! Pie!
Group| Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!
Nellie| Oh.
Andy| I changed my mind.
Nellie| Oh, you signed it?
Andy| Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it.  Well, yeah, whatever. So.
Nellie|  â€œShes tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. Shell make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.â€
Kevin| I insult you, Oscar.
Oscar| What?
Kevin| I insult you! To your face!
Oscar| I dont know what youre talking about.
Kevin| Then why dont you do something about it?
Oscar|  Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Kevin| You dont have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes!
Pam| Oh my god. Im getting so stuffed.
Jim| We did it.
Pam| You did it.
Andy| My name is Andy!
Group|  Yeah.
Andy| I dont do drugs!
Group| Yeah.
Andy|  Now check the style!
Group| Yeah.
Andy| Of Flatt & Scruggs!
Group| Yeah.
Pam| Role call.
Phyllis| Role call.
Oscar| Role call.
Creed| What?
