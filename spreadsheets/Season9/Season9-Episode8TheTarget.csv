Oscar| Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that Im having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if shes cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, its business as usual.
Oscar| Good morning. 
Angela| Oscar...  can I ask you a question?
Oscar|  Of course, ask me a que-- Â questions.
Angela| Is it cool in here to you?
Oscar|  Yes, a little bit.  Yes.
Angela| I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Oscar| Its the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So Im gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. Ill just go downstairs.
Angela| Thank you.
Oscar| No, thank you, Angela.
Oscar| She doesnt know. I shouldnt be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. 
Dwight| Well, well, well, its finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Pam| These are my painting clothes.I think Im gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. 
Meredith| Sure you dont want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Jim| You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Pam| Are you avoiding your phone call?
Jim| What? Yeah, right. As if. 
Jim| Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there. 
Pam| Last week Jim wasnt there, and they named the company Athlead.
Jim| I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. 
Pam| Tell them your opening line.
Jim|  Hey David, how would you like a guy whos not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
Pam| I think its good. He likes fishing.
Jim| This is gonna be awful.
Pete| One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when theyre in, I fill out one of these cards. But the informations already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to â€œchillax,â€ and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Dont give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Â Fight the power.
Angela| Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. 
Angela|  Ugh!
Dwight| Come on in, the waters fine. 
Angela| Dwight, its not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. 
Dwight| I know. Thats not why Im naked. I always work out without my clothes. 
Angela| Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Dwight| Oh, Im sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If Im not in your panties, I dont go vigilantes. Why dont you ask your husband?
Angela| My marriage is in danger. I dont know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. 
Dwight|  All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Angela| Â Something like that.
Dwight| Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. 
Angela| Can you arrange a meeting?
Dwight| I can try. Im gonna use SMS text.
Angela| Okay.
Dwight| Text went through. 
Angela| Okay.
Dwight| All we can do is sit and wait. 
Angela| Okay.
Dwight|  Oh, look at that. Yeah, hes free anytime. Not a problem. 
Jim| I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. 
David|  Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If theres a crisis -- the more I think about it -- 
Jim| Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while Im gone.
David| They did?
Jim| Yep.
David| Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. 
Jim| Oh, great.
Stanley| Why should we help you?
Jim| Because were friends.
Stanley| When is my birthday?
Jim| Unfair. Whens my birthday?
Stanley| I dont know, because were not friends. 
Jim| How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
Stanley| Now were talkin.
Jim| All right.
Phyllis| Yeah.
Kevin| Make it go taller.
Pete| Thats the idea.
Kevin| No, not taller this way, taller this way. 
Pete| Well, Ive gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
Kevin| Youre not getting this, Peter. Â Make it go wider... up!
Pete| Will do.
Darryl|  What are yall doing?
Kevin| Me and Pete are building a tower. 
Darryl| Cool. It should be taller though, right?
Kevin| Obviously. Hes a sweet kid, Darryl. But hes not the sharpest guy in the drawer. 
Pete| Kevin, I can hear you.
Kevin| Huh?
Angela| Ow! Dwight! Ow!
Dwight| Get in the van.
Angela| God!
Trevor| Is it safe to talk?
Dwight| Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I dont see them so I think were good.
Angela| So what are your credentials?
Trevor| I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, Im damn good at it. 
Angela| Do you have a gun?
Dwight|  Does he own a gun? Show her.
Trevor| You tell me.
Angela| What is this?
Trevor| Its the receipt for my gun.
Angela| You dont carry it with you?
Trevor| Read the receipt. Thats a $300 gun. Someone could steal it. 
Dwight| Do you have any idea how many guns Trevors had stolen from him?
Trevor| Now I keep it in a safe.
Dwight| Mm-hmm. Good safe?
Trevor| Oh, you tell me. 
Dwight| Wow!
Pam|  I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. Its just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, Im gonna limit myself to one shrub. 
Hide| You paint wall now?
Pam| Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that... 
Hide| You paint now.
Pam| Its probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing. 
Hide| I wait.
Meredith| Sweet.
Erin| Yay!
Darryl| Thats what Im talkin about.
Pete| This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote â€˜sausage factory.
Meredith| Oh OOOH!
Everyone| 
Meredith| Boom!
Darryl| Bang.
Kevin| Yep, yep, yep.
Pete| All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
Creed| Lets find out what I did.
Pete| All right.
Dwight| You get half now and half upon completion of said job. 
Trevor| And thats all off the books?
Angela| Obviously.
Trevor| Nice. No taxes. 
Angela| Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here. 
Trevor| So whats the job?
Angela| Murder.
Trevor| Okay, thats the big one. Thats the big â€œM.â€ 
Dwight| You cant have someone murdered.
Angela| What if they deserved it? 
Dwight| What did they do to you, Angela?
Angela| Theyre sleeping with my husband. 
Dwight| Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you. 
Trevor| This seems a little crazy.
Dwight| Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
Trevor| But I think Im up for it. 
Dwight| No! No!
Angela| Thank you.
Dwight| Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. Ive had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch-- 
Trevor| Thats very effective. Ive been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. Its devastating.
Angela| No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer. 
Trevor| What about a knee-capping?
Dwight| No! Youre not helping, Trevor!
Angela| Yes, a knee-capping could work. 
Dwight| No. Angela! What are you saying? 
Angela| You said you would be there for me. 
Dwight| Im trying, but what youre asking is-- 
Angela| Its the only thing that will make this right. 
Dwight| Okay. But its cruel, because a woman with damaged knees cant scrub worth a damn. 
Trevor| All right, then its settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 400. Keep in mind, once I leave, theres no turning back. 
Jim| You know, truth be told, I think all youll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while Im gone. 
Stanley| Weve got all afternoon to talk about that. 
Waiter| Morning, folks.
Stanley| Ill have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster. 
Waiter| Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--
Stanley| Not enough lobster. Side order. 
Phyllis| How much wine do you have? 
Oscar| I brought you a cookie. 
Angela| Oh, thanks, Oscar. Youre such an angel. 
Oscar|  I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, were good. Yeah.  We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye. 
Pete| There we go.
Everyone| 
Pete| Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. 
Nellie| Oooohh... you salty dog.
Darryl| Well, yeah, what can I say, a players gotta play. 
Pete| There you go.
Darryl| Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But Im gonna let them think the other thing. 
Kevin| Okay, I got this one. 
Nellie| Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
Kevin| No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath. 
Everyone|  Oh no! Kevin!
Nellie| What did I just say? What did I just say?
Pete| Hey, hey, hey, its just a mistake. Just a mistake. Thats what this towers all about -- Â mistakes. Okay, if youre afraid of screwing up, the towers not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? Thats right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Lets get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? 
Kevin| Yeah. 
Pete| There we go. All right, lets do it. 
Jim| You know, at the end of the day, its really only two days. I mean, Ill be back in the office. Â If you need me for an emergency, call me. Â Ill be there...
Phyllis| You know what? I dont know where the years went. Â â€˜Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I dont even recognize them. 
Jim| Tell me about it.
Phyllis| Whose hands are these?  Theyre not my hands. I dont know. 
Jim| All right. You know what? Â Maybe well just... Well go slow.
Phyllis| No. Jim... 
Pete| All right. Check it out.
Everyone| 
Pete| Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! 
Kevin| Nice. Â Pretty soon, were gonna be at the ceiling. 
Erin| Whoo!
Pete| Can you hand me a card?
Erin| Um,. its empty. 
Pete| What?
Nellie| Oh, come on. We could use a blank card. 
Everyone| No!!
Meredith| Thats cheating.
Pam| I could get us a complaint. 
Meredith| You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldnt fart on a butterfly.
Pam| No, I wouldnt. I cant even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. Id like to try. 
Nellie| Hmm. Yeah. Â All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam... 
Everyone|  â€œPam!â€
Angela| What? Why did you call me out here?
Dwight| The target-- its Oscar, isnt it? He and the senator are gaying each other. 
Angela| I dont know what youre talking about.
Dwight| Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time youre engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. 
Angela| Fine! Its Oscar. So what? 
Dwight| Well I could understand you wanting to get a strangers knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
Angela| Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. 
Dwight| I cant even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. 
Angela| Well, you might be right. But its too late now. 
Dwight| What do you mean?
Angela| Hes here. 
Dwight| No! No, no!  
Dwight| Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
Oscar| What? 
Dwight| Come -- come with me.
Oscar| What are you doing?
Dwight| There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. Theyre extraordinary. 
Meredith| Yahtzee.
Trevor| Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez. 
Kevin| I am Oscar Martinez. 
Angela| No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. 
Kevin| Wha-- wh--
Angela| You know, theres doughnuts in the break room. 
Kevin| Nice! Yeah. 
Jim| Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over. 
Stanley| Dont be pushy Jim. Its tacky. 
Jim| All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, thats-- thats decorative. 
Phyllis| No, theres wine in here. 
Jim| Still decorative.
Stanley| Is it white wine? 
Jim| No.
Phyllis|  Can you help me? 
Jim| Dont-- dont-- dont pole people with knives. 
Phyllis|  ha ha!
Jim| Phyllis! Â Wow. 
Stanley| Ooh, bring it over.
Phyllis| Got it. 
Dwight| Theres no time to explain.  Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. 
Oscar| Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? 
Dwight| What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man whos the father of her child? 
Oscar| I dont know what youre talking about.
Dwight| Oh, dont lie. Im trying to save those precious knees youre always bragging about. Â Now, lets get out of here. He could be right behind us. 
Dwight| Aah! Actually, hes right in front of us. 
Trevor| Lets get it on. Im gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but Im gonna do this. 
Dwight| No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. Hes a Dunder-Mifflin man. Hes my tribe. 
Trevor| Im sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, Im gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!
Oscar| I got it. 
Dwight| Disarm!
Trevor| You dont-- 
Dwight| Dont move. And disarm now! 
Trevor| Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
Dwight| No! No, Oscar. Hes a friend. Hes a friend.
Erin| Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. Theyre family-owned, but dont let that take away from your edge! 
Nellie| Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. 
Creed| Remember, youre a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this. 
Pam|  Hello, this is Pam Halpert. Im calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, â€œHey, kool-aid.â€ Yeah, your mamas fat. This is Pam Halpert. 
Pete| Did she buy it?
Pam| Basically I couldnt tell, but I think... 
Nellie| Were they angry?
Pam| I-- I thought they were confused at least...
Nellie| Okay.
Erin| Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client! 
Everyone| 
Kevin| Nice. Nice. 
Creed| You did good. You did good.
Pete| See ya later, Heymont. 
Dwight| No.
Trevor| If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend. 
Oscar| What the hell, Dwight?
Dwight| See ya later, Trevor.
Oscar| you are incorrigible!
Dwight| I just saved your life. Youre welcome! 
Oscar| You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
Angela| You deserved every bit of it! Â You made my husband gay. 
Oscar| What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! 
Angela| No. No.
Oscar| Angela, until you face that, youre gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I wont stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me. 
Angela| Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. 
Oscar| Angela, its a lead freaking pipe. 
Angela| God! 
Oscar| Aah!
Angela| You were supposed to be my friend. 
Oscar| Im so sorry. Angela--
Dwight| Oscar.
Pete| Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert... 
Everyone| 
Pete| For insulting a clients recently deceased mother. 
Nellie| Yes!
Pam| I did not know that. 
Pete| Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life. 
Pam| Im so sorry.
Meredith| Wow. 
Pete| yeah. Thats-- that is terrible. 
Everyone| 
Kevin| You did it.
Erin| Yeah!
Angela| I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. 
Dwight| Youre not stupid. Jazz is stupid. 
Angela|  Jazz is stupid! Â I mean, just play the right notes! 
Dwight| I know. Youre gonna be okay, Monkey. 
Angela| I dont like your friend Trevor. 
Dwight| I dont like him either. Â And yet I really like him. 
Jim| Well, were here. Perfect. Â 
Phyllis| Were gonna cover for you, ya know.
Stanley| 
Jim| Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
Stanley|  I did enjoy grinding your beans, son. 
Phyllis|  Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. 
Jim| This is hilarious, but were gonna stop with all-- 
Stanley| Shuckin your peas.
Jim| Shuckin the peas. Â You should go back to the first part, though. You are Â gonna Â cover for me? 
Stanley| Yeah.
Phyllis| Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys. 
Jim| Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you. 
Pam| If youre an artist, you have to be okay with the idea Â that you cant please everybody all the time. 
Hide| You paint very bad--
Pam| Shut up, Hide! Â I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? Im okay with that. 
Dwight| Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted? 
Toby| That is-- that is a loaded question. 
Angela| My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. 
Toby| He said that?
Angela| Well, he didnt fight me hard on it. 
Toby| I-- I dont know if theres truth to-- to, uh, to that. 
Angela| What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? 
Toby| Oh... uh...
Angela| Is it called red-vining? 
Dwight| Is it called red-vining?
Toby| I dont...
Dwight| We heard it was called red-vining.
Angela| People red vine.
Dwight| Where are gay mens vaginas?
Toby| They dont have vaginas.
Dwight| What?
Toby| No. Theyre just regular men. 
Dwight| When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other persons penis?
Toby| Uh... wow....
