Pam| Hey Brian, you got a sec?
Brian| Yeah, hold on a sec.
Pam| I feel awful.
Brian| Its fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. 
Erin|  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Pam| Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Brian| Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
Pam| Yeah, mostly.
Erin| Pam, phone call.
Pam| Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
Brian| Will do.
Pam| Okay. Thank you.
Brian| Sure.
Meredith| Hey, boom guy. 
Brian| Oh, hey Meredith.
Meredith| When are you gonna boom me?
Brian| Uh, listen, theyre cracking down on us talking to the subjects. Its a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna I, Ill see you later.
Meredith| Got it.
Clark| Hey, so I hear youre bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? 
Dwight| Thats right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. 
Clark| Well, uh see, you raised it.
Dwight| Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. 
Dwight| Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jims desk while hes away in Philly. Finally Ill have someone at my desk clump who gets me. Its like, â€œReally, Jim? You dont understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.â€ Wow. 
Clark| You know what, man? I deserve this job. 
Dwight| Mm-hmm. 
Clark| I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond and under. 
Dwight| You know what? Youre gonna get your interview, okay? I know that youre going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. 
Dwight| Clark has no chance. I mean, hes up against my buddy Rolf, for Gods sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ hell make you laugh so hard, youll puke your pants. 
Clark| This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome. 
Dwight| Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. 
Jim| You couldve just called that an alliance too, right?
Dwight| I chose my words very carefully. 
Jim| Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, thats only gonna make things worse. 
Clark|  You interviewing for the sales job too?
Rolf| No. Youre interviewing for it. Im getting it. 
Clark| Well, I wouldnt be so sure about that. I mean, Ive been working here 12 weeks. Thats a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as weve seen. 
Rolf| Im Rolf. Rolf Ahl.
Clark| Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. 
Rolf| Go to hell. 
Clark| There he is. 
Dwight| Hey. Come on, buddy. Lets do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You dont compare. When youre with the R-O-L-F, youre literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. 
Rolf| Nice.
Dwight| Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy. 
Pam| When are you talking to David Wallace?
Jim| Im talking to him this afternoon, but dont get your hopes up. 
Pam| Too late. My hopes are up. 
Jim| Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so were scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company Im abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So problem solved. Thanks, guys. 
Dwight| And this chairs gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! 
Jim| Im on the phone. Im on the phone. 
Dwight| No doy!
Jim| Im just gonna call you back. Thanks. 
Rolf| I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I dont do earbuds. 
Dwight|  No earbuds!  
Jim| Im sure hes just nervous. 
Pam|  Its fine. Its just a seating arrangement. Doesnt matter. 
Dwight| So Ive got your resume here, but its not telling me everything. 
Rolf| Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know youre qualified to evaluate me?
Dwight| Well, Im the one offering the job. 
Rolf| What are your credentials?
Dwight| Ive worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. Im an Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
Rolf| I think Ive heard everything I need to hear. 
Dwight| Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. Im sure hed give a reference. 
Rolf| Thank you, Dwight. Ill be in touch. 
Dwight| Well, they cant all be winners. But Trevors next and hes a real professional. You say, â€œJump,â€ and he says, â€œOh who?â€ He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. 
Dwight|  What makes you think youd be an effective paper salesman?
Trevor| Ooh, okay. Didnt see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. 
Dwight| Well, its a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman. 
Trevor| Pass. Next one. 
Dwight| All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Trevor| No, no and no.
Dwight| There were only two options. 
Trevor| Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? 
Dwight| This is a bus transfer. 
Trevor|  Nothing gets by this guy. 
Clark| Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Jim| Sure, yeah, go ahead. 
Clark| Thanks, dude. Youâ€”you sure its okay? â€˜Cause youre kindaâ€”
Jim| Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? Youre clean, right? 
Clark| Oh, Dove Men.
Jim| Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You dont listen to it at all because were at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, soâ€”
Clark| Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? 
Jim| Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. 
Clark| Thanks, dude. 
Jim| Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. 
Clark| Why?
Jim| I need you to breathe in my face right now. 
Clark|  
Jim| What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? 
Clark| Wintergreen. 
Jim| I knew it, I knew it.
Clark| Yeah, good nose. 
Jim| I looked at you coming around, and I said, â€œWintergreen.â€
Dwight| I cant hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. 
Dwight| Okay, heres one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You cant rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. 
Clark| Thats just a classic no-win situation. 
Dwight| Thank you.
Clark| So Id Kobayashi Maru it.
Dwight| Damn it! Perfect answer, again. 
Clark| Yep.
Dwight| Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond 
Clark| You know what, Dwight? 
Dwight| And anothâ€”
Clark| This interviews over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Marud the whole process. 
Dwight| No.
Clark| Yeah. Star Trek rules. 
Dwight| It does, but still no. 
Clark| Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? 
Dwight| Oh, you think theyre my only friends? Ive got way more friends than that, and theyre all better than the losers who work here. 
 |Stanley
 This is not natural. |Oscar
 Just â€“ I dont wanna make assumptions based on peoples physical appearances. |Pam
 Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell? |Darryl
 They smell so bad. |Meredith
 If I ever get that bad, youd tell me, right? |Kevin
 Meredith, I tell you all the time. |Meredith
  Walked right into that one. |Dwight
 Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. Hes got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. Ive got big expectations, Mose-wise. |Dwight
 What quality would make you a good sales associate?|Mose
 People person. |Dwight
 It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical. |Mose
 Thats right. |Dwight
 You know we live together, right? |Mose
 Yes. |Dwight
 And Ive never seen you go to work, ever. |Mose
 Okay. |Dwight
 So why is this on your resume? |Clark
 So howd you guys hear about the position?|Gabor
 Myâ€”my mom.|Nate
 Dwight called my house, but he didnt realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I cant stay out of her stuff. |Zeke
 Dwights my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. |Clark
 You were in the shower or he was in the shower?|Zeke
 Everyone was in the shower. Its a cow shower, so theres like, a ton of people in there. |Clark
 So you guys all know Dwight already? |Melvina
 I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby. |Gabor
 I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school. |Melvina
 You went to X-Men school too? |Clark
 X-Men school? |Dwight
 When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out. |Gabor
 Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levis. A lot of telemarketing. |Angela
 I dont want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something. |Stanley
 I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didnt work then. And now look what hes doing to us. |Nellie
 Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. |Jim
 How is it my fault? |Nellie
 Heres an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. |Jim
 But its Dwight whos bring in all the weirdos. |Oscar
 Yeah, but Jim, Dwights a weirdo. We cant blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos. |Pam
 Hey, Im the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jims away. Im in a position where Im rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off. |David Wallace
  Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. |Jim
 Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”|Dwight
  This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And dont lie. I can tell if youre lying. |David Wallace
 Hey, Dwight. Its David. |Dwight
 David.|David Wallace
 Jim says hed like some say in the hiring process. |Dwight
 Really? Thats interesting. â€˜Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me whos here every day. And frankly, killing it lately. |Jim
 I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wifeâ€”|David Wallace
 Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. |Jim
 Oh. Um|David Wallace
 Yeah. |Jim
 Okay. I cant say that thats not fair. |Dwight
 Sounds fair to me, David. |David Wallace
 And I know we have a call scheduled for later â€“ |Jim
 Oh, yeah, so well just do that later. |Dwight
 No. Why not do it now?|David Wallace
 Yeah. Whats up Jim? |Jim
 Uh  Well, its about Athlead. Im sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? |Dwight
 Id love to be in the loop, David. |David Wallace
 Its okay. Go ahead, Jim. |Jim
 Theres a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor â€“ |David Wallace
 Okay. Jim, Im gonna have to stop you right there. |Jim
 Yes, okay. Bye. |Dwight
  Id love to invest. |Jim
 No, thanks. |Dwight
 Id like to give you $100 million.   |Hide
 Why you make trees into bushes? You dont make paper from bushes. |Pam
 Hide, theyre giving out jobs upstairs. Why dont you go up and get one? |Hide
 Thank you. |Pam
 Yeah. |
Troy| Whoops. 
Zeke|  Its dense. Like bread. 
Jim| Dwight, you cant just hire someone â€˜cause theyre your friend.
Dwight| Im not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. 
Nellie| Theyre freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. 
Dwight| You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero. 
Darryl| Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating. 
Wolf| Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. 
Dwight| Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. 
Dwight| Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. 
Dwight| Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this. 
Wolf| Do you want this paper? 
Dwight| I sure do. 
Wolf| Its not very good.
Dwight| I will pay you whatever it takes. 
Wolf| I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. 
Dwight| No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money. 
Wolf| Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. Its over.
Dwight| Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. Youre still at the 570 number? 
Wolf| I am.
Dwight| Okay. Good, good, good. 
Hide| I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. 
Dwight| This isnt gonna work out. 
Hide| Thank you. 
Dwight| Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. Hes a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet Im hesitant. Why cant I pull the trigger on any of them?
Dwight|  No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.  
Melvina| Do you need to be changed? 
Dwight| I do that myself now. 
Melvina| Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? Ive been double-parked for five hours. Im wondering if I should move my car. 
Dwight| No, youve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Melvina| Well, the jokes on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas. 
Trevor| Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, were still gonna be your friend. 
Wolf| Yeah, whether its me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvinaâ€”
Dwight| Or none of you 
Wolf| Yeah, youd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us. 
Trevor| Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. 
Dwight| I wish I could hire all of you. 
Zeke| I could start Monday. 
Dwight| Psst. Jim Jim?  Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. 
Jim| Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If Im not looking south, Im not livin.  Thats what I always say. 
Dwight| Just act natural. 
Dwight| And I was thinking its only fair that you help make this decision since theyll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. 
Jim| But you know I wouldnt hire any of these all-stars. 
Dwight| Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, its your call. 
Jim| Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? 
Dwight| I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldnt picture any of them in the old gold and gray. 
Jim| I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. 
Dwight| Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. 
Jim| Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? 
Dwight| Yes. Thank you. Amazed. 
Jim| And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. 
Sensei Ira| Im sorry?
Dwight| What? This is such bullcrap!
Jim| Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. 
Dwight| Wow. So much crap. Its just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? 
Jim| Too much now.
Dwight| Okay. 
Nate| Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. 
Dwight| Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halperts home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
Jim| That seems inconsiderate. 
Rolf| No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Dont open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. 
Dwight| Guys, it wasnt up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasnt my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor. 
Trevor| Well, my days shot.
Rolf| Yeah, its that weird hour where its too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swansons. 
Wolf| I got it. Paintball. 
Dwight| Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work? 
Trevor|  And what are we supposed to do until then?
Dwight| Okay.
Wolf| Lets just go, you guys. 
Rolf| Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right? 
Jim| All right. I think that went well.
Jim| So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then thatll print outâ€”Hey. Meet your new desk mate. 
Clark| Whats up good lookin?
Pam| Oh, cool. Hey Clark. 
Jim| Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering. 
Pam| Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. 
Jim| Okay. Im really sorry I told the guys Id be there for the board meeting. 
Pam| Of course. 
Jim| Ill call you when I get there.
Pam| Okay.
Jim| All right. 
Pam| Bye.
Jim| Take care of my wife. I will be back. 
Dwight| They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours. 
Clark| Hey, Pam, Im going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Pam| Im good. 
Dwight| Oh, hey, Ill take a coffee.
Clark| Oh, Im sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. 
Dwight| 
Pam| Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? 
Dwight| Who, me?
Pam| Us. 
Dwight| Absolutely, I do. 
Pam| Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ill distract him, you take that. 
Dwight| Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, thats great.
Pam| 
Pam &amp; Dwight| 
Dwight| Aah!
Clark| No!
Dwight| Welcome to the club, pig! 
Pam| No, Dwight!
Dwight| Aah!
Jim| No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when Im gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
