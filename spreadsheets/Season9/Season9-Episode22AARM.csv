Erin| The tea in Nepal is very hot. 
Kevin| But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. 
Dwight| Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now theyre protecting Americas real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the days security codes. Something thats been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. Its not the KGB, but its a start.
Erin| The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Dwight| But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Erin| Close.
Dwight| This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
Erin| Colder.
Dwight| The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Erin| No, I meant youre getting colder. The correct response is, â€œthe coffee in Peru is much hotter.â€
Dwight| Ah, much, ok.
Erin| But, thats three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol?
Dwight| No, no. Give me the steam.
Dwight| Its just harmless steam to panic intruders. Id like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Dwight|  Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Creed|  Oh, Im saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Philip| Mama!
Oscar| Angela, someone wants you.
Angela| Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
Oscar| Angelas divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that its Angela whos living in the closet. Hey-o.
Oscar| Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Esther| Go get â€˜em, honey.
Dwight| Oh, dont worry. Theyll get got.
Dwight| Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check on that later today. This is my grandmothers ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmothers buttock bullet ring.
Andy| Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary thats premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. 
Check-in guy| Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
Andy| Yes!
Andy| Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning Americas Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. Its a really cool show, its like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Jim| Sales form for you to sign.
Dwight| You know what to do.  Ok
Dwight| Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Jim| Aw, thanks, man.
Dwight| Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but weve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warâ€”
Jim| No.
Dwight| Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Jim| Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Pam| Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Jim| All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay.
Pam| Is that them again?
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| Maybe you should call back?
Jim| I will. I will.
Jim| The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and thats final. I almost lost Pam over this business. Im not risking that again.
Pam| When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, hes giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, hes certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. 
Dwight| Welcome.
Jim| He welcomes you.
Dwight| Please take an agenda item.
Jim| Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Dwight| Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. â€œSome say the only failure there is is the failure to try.â€  That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Jim| Lets not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if youre expecting a fax today, please dont yell out, â€œMichael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.â€ Ok? Thats nonsense.
Pam| Question.
Jim| Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Pam| We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as theyre delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, â€œNice jugsâ€?
Jim| Thats obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Everyone|  Zero. No nonsense. You cant have nonsense.
Dwight|  What is going on?
Angela| Daycare wont take Phillip anymore.
Oscar| Why?
Angela| Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they wont forgive. So, hi.
Oscar| Hi, buddy.
Dwight| Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Jim| Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Whos excited?
Meredith| Id better come out of this smelling like a rose. Ive been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasnt for the cameras, I wouldve done some truly vulgar crap.
Stanley| Over the course of this documentary Ive had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble my wife did it.
Dwight| Im letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Kevin| Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richards. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Oscar| I cant believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
Creed| This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Andy| This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang â€œI Dreamed a Dreamâ€ from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Casey| Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio!  Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
Andy| No!
Casey| America wants it!
Andy| No, this is my time! You dont belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Casey|  Casey Dean!
Andy|  Casey Dean!
Casey| Man, those are some nice pipes.
Andy| Yeah.
Casey| Whats your name?
Andy| Andy. Whats yours?
Angela| Why didnt you pack the apple snacks?
Oscar| Why didnt you pack the apple snacks?
Kevin| Guys.
Angela| Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Kevin| Guys.
Angela| Why dont you pack it?
Kevin| Guys.
Angela &amp; Oscar| Kevin, what?
Kevin| Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says â€œbold frontâ€ instead of â€œcold frontâ€? Its insane.
Angela| Not now, Kevin. Cant you see were busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Oscar| Seriously, Kevin. Im just gonna have to go to the store.
Angela| Ok, you go to the store.
Kevin| Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. Its all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Dwight| Not now! Private time!
Jim| I love Star Wars as much as the next guyâ€”
Dwight| Hey, hey! Seriously? 
Jim| My god, Im so sorry. Well this might make up for it I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Dwight| Which is, of course
Jim| Potential future nonsense.
Dwight| Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Jim| Im gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youve got a regional manager.
Dwight| The power source.
Jim| Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
Dwight| A loyal, but bungling apostle.
Jim| But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Dwight| Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Jim| Exactly.
Dwight| Id have to get some more wire and string, but its doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Jim| Yeah, right. I mean, unless theyre willing to pass some tests.
Dwight| I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Jim| Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Dwight| That doesnt sound crazy, Jim. Thats the sanest thing Ive ever heard.
Casey| Whatre you listening to?
Andy| Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Casey| Oh, sweet.
Andy| A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
Mark McGrath| Whats up, everybody? And welcome to Americas Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
Casey| Ah! Its Mark McGrath! Oh my god! Youre gorgeous!
Mark McGrath| Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!
Andy| Theres a mole?
Mark McGrath| Oops. Im not supposed toâ€”Im not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
Andy| What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Mark McGrath| Good man right there. Ill see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
Andy| Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me! 
Casey| What? On a roll much?
Andy| I dont know where it came from.
Casey| That was amazing, man!
Andy| Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Casey| Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
Andy| I did, I felt it.
Casey| Big time.
Pam| What are you so excited about?
Jim| Nothing.
Pam| What are you up to?
Jim| Members of the office, hear ye. 
Dwight| That means ye, Plop!
Pete| Plop? Still?
Dwight| We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Pete| Fine.
Jim| Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Erin| Aw, heck ya!
Pam| Nice.
Dwight| Youll always have the upper hand, when youve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Jim| This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but thats for fueling only. No savoring.
Dwight| Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Jim| He envies you.
Dwight| You dont need to repeat right now, when Im saying it.
Jim| Alright.
Jim| By 200, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Darryl| What up?
Glenn| Whats going on? How was the delivery?
Darryl| Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows Im here.
Darryl| I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Jim| A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Meredith| Uh, two.
Jim| 985,000,000,000,017.
Dwight| Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
Jim| Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Pam| Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Jim| Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Dwight| Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each others minds. Youre trying to give your wife this job.
Jim| Thats exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Pete| A horse.
Jim| Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Pete| Whats the opposite of a horse?
Jim| Come on. 
Jim &amp; Dwight| Sea horse.
Jim| Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”
Jim &amp; Dwight| Say that? Uncanny.
Jim| Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
Clark| Yeah.
Jim| Do you want a corn dog?
Clark| I would love a corn dog.
Jim| Well see. You are an assistant whos just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Clark|  Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.â€
Dwight| No, no, no, no! You dont read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. Theres no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries dont have diplomatic relations.
Jim| Uncanny.
Soldier| I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, theyll feel like anything is possible.
Andy| Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Casey| Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
Andy| What?
Casey| Yeah.
Andy| Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Casey| I dont know. But Im getting really worried here.
Andy| Me too. Hold my place in line.
Casey| Where are you going?
Andy| They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Darryl| Thanks, man.
Hank| Thank you.
Darryl| Yep. Take care.
Pam| Darryl, hey.
Darryl| Hey.
Pam| Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Darryl| No, no, Im not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didnt say goodbye to.
Pam| Aha. Hows Athlead?
Darryl| We livin like rock stars. Im about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Pam| Wow. 
Darryl| Jim really doesnt want to come?
Pam| He says he doesnt want to.
Darryl| Wow. Man. I hope he doesnt regret it.
Pam| Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
Darryl| Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Pam| Thats what he says.
Darryl| If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Jim| An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Dwight| A thousand times more.
Phyllis| Ill try this one. 
Jim| Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Phyllis|  Hot!
Jim| Yeah. Its real. Its the only way youll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! Shes through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Dwight|  No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
Jim| Look at that form.
Dwight|  Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Heres your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! 
Jim| Uncanny. 
Erin| Darryl?! Darryl!
Kevin| Whoa.
Darryl| Oh, hey. Hey, whats up, yall?
Erin| You left us without saying goodbye.
Darryl| Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
Meredith| Hey! No way!
Kevin| Thats totally uncool.
Erin| Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Darryl| I dont think I sh-
Erin| Get upstairs, mister!
Meredith| Yeah!
Kevin| Right. Now.
Darryl| Guess Im going upstairs.
Jim| You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingâ€”none of these people are good enough.
Dwight| I know.
Jim| What Im about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ive ever said.
Dwight| Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Jim| Is-
Dwight| Me.
Jim| The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. 
Dwight| Yes!  Thank you.
Jim| I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  Thats it. You look really, really good.  
Dwight| Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Jim| Hey.
Pam| Hey.
Jim| You all right? Whats going on?
Pam| Are you happy?
Jim| Yes, Im happy.
Pam| No, I know that youre, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
Jim| Yeah.
Pam| And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Jim| What?
Pam| What about five years from now?
Jim| Pam.
Pam| Because Im so glad youre back, baby, but Im justâ€”I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like youre giving up so much.
Jim| This was my decision, not yours.
Pam| Okay.
Jim| You didnt force me.
Pam| I kind of forced you to do it.
Jim| You did not force me to do this.
Pam| Yes, I did.
Jim| I dont know how else to tell you.
Pam| Im afraid that youre gonna resent me and Im afraid thatâ€”
Jim| Resent you?
Pam| This is not enough for you and Im afraid that Im not enough for you.
Jim| Is that really what you think?
Jim| Not enough? I dont know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know its against the rules but Im gonna need a favor from you guys.
Camera Crew| Okay. You got it, man.
Darryl| I didnt realize we were this close.
Phyllis| Were all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Meredith| Are you gonna come to Poor Richards and watch with us tonight?
Darryl| Uh yeah. Depending on traffic.
Stanley| He aint coming.
Erin| Oh, god!
Darryl| These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Darryl| Well, its been great.
Phyllis| Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then hes gone for who knows how long.
Darryl| Maybe forever. Anyhowâ€”
Oscar| Did we ever have lunch together, justâ€”just the two of us? You know what, Im gonna make reservations right now at Cuginos.
Meredith| Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Darryl| Oh, oh, Im sure we did.
Meredith| Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Clark| Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Erin| Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryls next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then well get this started.
Darryl| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and thats on me. But Im not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause youre feeling sentimental. 
Meredith| You have to! 
Darryl| Hey, hey, hey. Ill do one thing with yall.
Phyllis| Which thing?
Darryl| I dont care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Angela| Kevin, Kevin.
Kevin| Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. 
Angela| Kevin, could you not do that?
Kevin| What? Im moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Oscar| Here, use my pen.
Kevin| Dont tell me what to do!
Angela &amp; Oscar| Shhh!
Kevin| No, I dont need this! And you obviously dont need me.
Angela| Kevin, where are you going?
Kevin| Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Oscar| He just wont go down. Its as if hes excited by all this paper.
Angela| I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Dwight| Smart baby. Thats the most flavorful bond.
Andy| Hey, whats goin on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the younguns?
Casey| Youre back!
Andy| No, its me, Andy!
Casey| No, I know.
Andy| No, no, no. Im wearing makeup.
Casey| You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
Andy| Oh, I took out my lifts.
Casey| Oh.
Andy| Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
Casey| Oh.
Esther| All day long, its moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
Dwight| Oink the pigs, that is very important. 
Esther| Dwight, Im telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
Dwight| The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Dwight|  Thank you, Esther.
Esther| Bye.
Jim| You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Dwight| I need you to perform a test.
Jim| Perform a test.
Dwight| On an innocent baby.
Jim| Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so Im gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, dont worry, hes the best in the biz.
Dwight| Damn straight.
Jim| Unless you think he cant handle it.
Dwight| Hey, he can handle it.
Jim| All right.
Oscar|  Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanleys sleeping. You dont want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Stanley| I heard that.
Phillip| Mama.
Dwight| Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, theres no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Pam| He does have a gift.
Oscar| Well, hes calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Phillip| Mama.
Dwight| Okay.  You ever been in a managers office before?
Dwight| Phillip, you wanna play a little game? Its called â€œSchrute or Consequences.â€ Youre gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Phillip| Beet.
Dwight| Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but youre no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Check-in guy| Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.
People in line| Oh come on! Hey!
Andy| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Check-in guy| But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch Americas Next A Cappella Sensaâ€”
Andy|  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You cant do that. You cant do that, weve all been waiting.
Check-in guy| Okay.
Andy| I am going in there! Dontâ€”
Check-in guy| No, youre not, sir.
Andy| Dontâ€”dontâ€”
Check-in guy| Please dont.
Andy| Dont touch me.
Check-in guy| Im not touching you. Okay? 
Casey| Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Dont you dare. Dont getâ€”I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. Im Casey Dean! Youll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you wont be seeing the last of me! 
Oscar| Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I dont know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Dwight| That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when hes being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Kevin| Hes not that smart. He doesnt know where I hid his duck.
Andy|  Hi. Youre still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. Youre like, my three favorite people ever.
Santigold| What is this?
Andy|  Sweetheart, youre amazing, okay? Youre obviously gonna be on the show, so its someone elses turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right,  my name is Ezra Cornell and Im just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Aaron Rodgers| No, youre a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
Andy| Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
Clay Aiken| No, we do not want to hear you sing.
Santigold| Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
Andy| Nope! Cant end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my bosss car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Aaron Rodgers| Flag on the play.
Andy| Thatsâ€”thats whatâ€”yeah. Okay, all right, well, heres the song.  Far above Cayugas waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma materâ€”
Santigold| What is this song?
Andy| Are you insane? Its the Cornell fight song.
Clay Aiken| Listen, all right, thank you very much, were not interested.
Andy| You didnt let me finish. Thats not fair.
Aaron Rodgers| Look, man, youre not terrible. Weve heard a lot of really good singers today and youre just not good enough.
Andy| Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess thats the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
Aaron Rodgers| Can he do this?
Andy|  Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, youre never fully dressed without a smile.  Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummellyâ€”
Santigold| Look, you gotta go.  You cant just sit here and cry.
Andy| Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Jim|  Thank you.
Oscar| Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Kevin| Cant hear you. Im giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Oscar| Okay, I guess, its just that Phillip got you something.
Angela| Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Oscar| I think theres, like, $7 left.
Angela| Its just his way of saying, â€œThanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.â€
Kevin| Phillip got this for me?
Oscar| Sure.
Kevin| That was a really cool move.
Angela| Would you like to hold Phillip?  Yeah. Thats Kevin.
Kevin| Whoa.
Oscar| Easy.
Kevin| What a chubbers. Whoa.
Angela| Okay, watch it.
Kevin| Im losing my balance.
Angela| No, Kevin, no.
Oscar| Hey, no.
Kevin| Whoa!
Oscar| No horseplay.
Angela| Stop it.
Kevin| You wanna play with the cactus?
Angela| No, no!
Kevin| So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided were gonna be best friends. Hes a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Erin| We have our decision.
Darryl| You chose one thing?
Erin| We want to dance with you.
Darryl| You want to dance?
Erin| One dance, all of us together.
Darryl| This is what you want?
Erin| Absolutely.
Darryl| Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause were gonna do this right.
Erin| Yes! 
Angela| Hey. You wanted to see me?
Dwight| Door. Chair. Its about Phillip.
Angela| I am sorry hes here today but I hadâ€”
Dwight| I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Angela| How thoughtful.
Dwight| Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, lets face it, is a big step up from living in a gay mans closet.
Angela| If he is your son, thats a great plan. But hes not. Hes not your son.
Dwight| Very well.
Angela| Can I go back to my desk now?
Dwight| Yes.
Pam| What is this?
Jim| Well Ive been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldnt believe me, so  I needed a little help.
Dwight| Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Jim| OK, I dont have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Dwight|  Now.
Jim| I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. 
Dwight| Jim. Im not kidding. I need you.
Pam| Go ahead.
Jim| Ok, um, this is â€”Ill be right back.
Jim| What do we got?
Dwight| I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Jim| Wow! Congratulations, thats a really big step.
Dwight| Shes got a ton of great qualities. Shes young, shes beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because were third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isnt technically incest.
Jim| Right in the sweet spot. I think youre gonna be really happy.
Dwight| Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Jim|  Thats a lot of pros.
Dwight| And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Jim| So what is the problem?
Dwight| Angela. 
|Jim
 I dont know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time Ive been faced with a tough decision, theres only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. |Dwight
 Some sort of virus?|Jim
 Love.|Dwight
 Oh.|
Jim| Dwight, listen no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman whos gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Dwight| Youre a good assistant, Jim.
Jim| Not as good as you.
Dwight| Thats very true. Get the hell outta here. 
Jim| You got it.
|Jim
 You watched it.|Pam
 Yeah.|Jim
 Well, then I guess youre ready for this. |Pam
 Whats that?|Jim
 Its from the teapot. Everything youll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything.|Pam
 Thank you.|Erin
 Ok, everybody ready?|Phyllis
 Hit it, red! |Darryl
 I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. Im gonna miss these guys.|Oscar
